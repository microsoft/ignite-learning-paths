# Using Pre-Built AI to Solve Business Challenges

This is the repository supporting the Ignite Tour 2019-2020 talk, "Using
Pre-Built AI to Solve Business Challenges". Here you will find links to the
resources mentioned in the talk, and the code and scripts you will need to
recreate the demos given in the talk.

## Talk Summary

As a data-driven company, Tailwind Traders understands the importance of using
Artificial Intelligence to improve business processes and delight customers.
Before investing in an AI team, their existing developers were able to
demonstrate some quick wins using pre-built AI technologies. In this session, we
will show how you can use Azure Cognitive Services to extract insights from
retail data and go into the neural networks behind computer vision. Youâ€™ll learn
how it works and how to augment the pre-built AI with your own images for custom
image recognition applications.
