"Runs huge! returning the m for a s; normally a m top and s bottom in sizing. very soft, wonderful colour."
"I ordered both colors in xxs (xs p and xxs p were both sold out at the time sale came on): verdict, fits really nicely, but short. i would have to wear this with higher rise pants or pencil skirt (like the red one is pictures with a polka dot skirt). i decided to keep the red one, because it is a bot more unique, i do have a few navy tops. the xxs fits ""fitted"" (can't think of another way of saying it), so i like it as it will go nicely with looser bottoms. i love the sleeves, the ruffles make t"
Love! accurate sizing feminine details my new favorite top
"I initially worried about these because i am curvy on the bottom and short (5'3), but they balance me out perfectly. they are light and airy and perfect for summer. i have paired them with form fitting tops which work best considering the bottom volume., and my latigo clogs which give me some height. these are my new favorite go-to pants!"
"I bought my usual size medium and it's huge on me. if i sized down, my chubneck wouldn't be comfortable. the buttons are frustrating. the color, the pattten, the style are 100% gorgeous! i think i will belt mine"
"Loved this online, but the xs was too big and the material was too bulky."
"When i first saw the bees embroidered pullover in the store, it instantly caught my attention. since it was pricey, i didn't get it. when it went on sale, it ran out in my size. so recently i was fortunate enough to get the same style embroidered birds pullover in the store for 20% off the sale price. this shirt looks so adorable on and is different than the typical sweatshirt."
Comfortable and a great color for spring and summer
"Love the shape of this top. i bought in white and a friend bought in the neutral pink. we both required a tank/cami to layer under it. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and ordered a size small."
Loved this sweater but too boxy
"A beautiful shawl but not practical. i was impressed with how elegant/romantic it first felt/looked.  however, after 5 minutes of wear, it would not stay on my shoulders. the design is very awkward and despite several attempts with different tops/tanks underneath, i kept running into the same problem. lovely for the first 5 minutes of wear and then awkwardly/annoyingly wouldn't stay on my shoulders. the neckline is undefined and it just fell off. not a great design. disappointedly returned it."
This reminds me of the 1970's. the fabric is soft and it looks just like the picture. i'm ordering it in line in a petite. my store doesn't carry petites. it's typical moth quality and fit. perfect.
"Love the color, ordered the plum. it is very nice in person, not quite as burgundy, more purple-y... i don't typically go for the plain dresses, as i feel at the price, it should be a statement, but i don
't have a dress like this:

wearable as casual or dressed up
solid plain color
soft fabric
long sleeves, yet sexy enough without being too much
flirty (it is on the shorter side)

i decided to keep it as dolan makes a similar dress every year, and i pass every year... this is the year"
"This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped. i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos, but i ended up liking that better. it is well made with thick (but not too thick) lined material. also, i was initially worried that the deep v-neck may be too deep for my liking, but once i had it on,it looked classic and not showy. i love the suit."
"I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it. i am either an xs or s in antho, and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy. normally i would have overlooked this shirt as it's rather unimpressive on the hanger, but it was on sale so i tried it on. very cute when tried on! it fits well across the shoulders but isn't too clingy in the body, which i like. the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor"
"This is one of my absolute favorite dresses of the season! fun, flirty and fashionable! i wore it with a chunky necklace, floppy hat and sandals one time and with wedges and dangly earrings the other time. it is a must own dress!"
"I love this dress, it's very comfortable, slim swing and very ingratiating. the fabric is light, i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves. overall, i'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress. i will definitely recommend it."
"I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year, similar to these, so when i saw this fun pair, i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.

they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so, so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.

i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time"
Love this top!
"A little shorter than expected. very billowy, so watch out for wind!
it fits well on the arms and shoulders. not too see through"
"I tried this on (blue) in size 0 or xs (not sure how sizing was), regular size (sometimes i need petite). i don't think i need petite in this one though, i love the peek of lighter solid fabric on the hem, the whole tank is very soft. probably need a strapless bra to wear it, but could be paired with jeans for casual look or nice pants. pencil skirt for dressier look. i am 115 lbs and 30 dd for reference."
"I have an hourglass shape and a large chest, so it's difficult to find dresses that don't like i'm wearing a sack or are too form-fitting to be appropriate. this dress is prefect for accentuating my waist, while still looking appropriate for weddings and other nice events! the color is perfect"
"I definitely trend towards preferring my clothes looser as a style but the fit on this dress felt a bit too boxy, i typically run between and x-small and small, should have gone with the x-small. i loved the print and quality of the dress though and would recommend it!"
"I have many pairs of ag jeans -- mostly stevie's & harper's -- and while they're comfortable, i am always glad to take them off at the end of the day. these jeans are different. the fabric is very, very soft & feels like it's been washed & worn dozens of times. but the color & finish of the jean looks polished & spiffy enough to wear for evenings out or casual friday. and the fit is perfect, once i went up a size. slim and figure hugging but not at all constricting. my regular stevie's always fe"
I love these pjs! the sale price finally made the set affordable and i could not be happier! so soft and comfy!
A little long but very comfortable. i've worn it to work and to a bridal shower so very versatile.
"This dress is just absolutely adorable! you can dress it up and wear it to a wedding, or you can dress it down and slip on a pair of sandals and use it as a casual summer dress! this dress does run a tad bit large - i'm usually a size 4 but the size 4 was slightly too big for me. best purchase yet!"
"I love this dress, but i am 5'7"" and a size 12, so am a bit curvy. this dress was great on the bottom, but the way that he did the top of it made me look even more busty than i am. i returned it for that reason. however, if he would make that ""skirt"" as a stand alone, i would buy in a second."
"I bought this online with the intention of it being my graduation dress. i'm 5'2"", 115 pounds so i should've known better and gotten a ""petite"" style dress. however, i loved the modern look of this and since my boobs are a bit bigger (34d) i figured they would help fill it out. upon receiving the dress, i was first shocked that for the price, the construction was pretty poor quality: there were strings coming out of the straps and they looked unevenly sewn. when i put it on, it was clear that th"
"I love this top - it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently, but often skimps on now. tit definitely runs small - i usually wear a 6 in retailer tops (sometimes a 4) and the 8 is quite fitted on me."
"This is a great fitting jacket. the style, etc.
i got this in the grey - i would have exchanged it for the green (but have a similar color that i bought last year from retailer.
so i ended up returning it - only because i didn't like the color on me."
"I am 5'6"" and wear between a 9-10 pant and m-l tops depending (i would consider myself a pear bodytype bc i have a thicker midsection and flat everywhere else). for this, i ordered a medium and it was slightly loose so if you are conscious about your midsection, ordering your normal size will probably be fine. the fabric is very lightweight like a normal drapey t-shirt would be made out of, just to keep in mind. the draping is really cool though. i would just probably hand-wash/ dry-clean, or if"
I saw this online and loved it. plus after reading the reviews i thought why not. but if you have a big chest beware. i am a 34ddd and a pretty solid medium. the volumous front of the vest added way to much to me and i sized down to a small. had to return.
"The dress was great! the zipper was just a little tough but over all a very classic, feminine piece."
"This top is fantastic. something about it has an ease of elegance and grace. the overall structure and design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to wear. i feel immediately put together and ready for anything. the fabric has great texture and flows well without feeling like the wind will carry you away. i purchased the off-white - it is a bit see-through, but i don't mind wearing a cami underneath."
"These are nice, flattering bra with light to medium suport. however the colors and patters are not quite as pictured. i almost suspect they are slightly different on each bra. exmaple: on the picture online the left side seems to be a light blue and the right one orange. on the bra i received the left side is a darker, bluishgreen color. the right side is orange and light purple. i would hae prefered the colors on the photo but it is not a big deal i guess. i ordered the color block shorts as we"
Although they didn't have any sizes left for me when i got to the store to buy it. they sent it for free and it arrived in one day it was awesome :-)
"I got these in black and i had tried on the gray in the store, they run small at the waist. i usually wear xs or small, but i ordered a medium. they are very comfortable on a warm day. they look great with a loose, tucked in blouse or tee. the down side is they catch and the lace pulls and gets fuzzy when rubbing against things. i realized this after a day of wear. i haven't washed yet, but plan to hand wash."
I ordered this dress on a whim because of the 20% off on mother's day weekend and i am so glad i did. this dress is very flattering. i have a hard time finding dresses that are a little loose but don't make me look fat. this dress has just the right cut. i recommend it for anyone who likes something not to tight but also flattering.
"Ordered the grey colored capris & they fit great. i am 5'5 110lbs and the size 25 fits me comfortably. i've recently been making a transition into more comfortable, looser style pants instead of skin tight jeans. these are great. still figure flattering, but comfortable and well made. the detail on the button section is lovely also."
"Flattering cut, perfect for work or play. even better yet, it was on sale! if they had it in other colors i would buy it! beautiful high-quality garment like all the others i have purchased at retailer!!!"
"This is a lovely dress looks very expensive, nice fabric and detail. i'm 6ft tall 160lb. i normally order a l/10 but got an m color black because other sizes were sold out. length wise the dress is a little shorter than it looks on the model, but then again i'm pretty tall. you can't really tell on the online photo but this dress has a white undergarment, which makes it great because of the see through detail on the fabric. size wise, i felt like even with an m the dress is oversized. it sits we"
"I love these jeans! they actually look better than the picture and you cannot beat the sale price. they are a boyfriend fit, but you can order your normal size. usually with boyfriends, i have to order one to two sizes down. with skinnies and more fitted jeans, i am a 29 and that's what i got. there is no sagging or stretching out after wearing them for a while. the wash is absolutely beautiful...very worn. hopefully the holes in the knees won't get even bigger. i have worn and washed them now q"
"In retailer dresses the petites usually fit me better, i'm short, but this regular fit well. looks super cute, i've gotten so many compliments on it. comfortable, and the pockets are always nice."
"I love the feel and quality of this sweatshirt. however, because of the embroidery/lace detail on the shoulders, it makes it a little stiff so the shoulders look slightly boxy."
I thought this skirt would fit just over the knee with a nice flowy build. instead it fit rather baggy and was longer than i expected. i felt dowdy in it.
"Love the pilcro brand, they are one of my favorites, even compared to other more expensive denim brands. i ordered my usual two sizes smaller and found they did not fit this time! i probably should have ordered one size smaller than my usual in this cut. sadly, i have to send these beauties back and hope for a pop-back."
"I wanted to love this dress, and i don't. it is soft, it is flattering on the model, and sits comfortably on the shoulders... until you move. the heaviness of the shoulders pulls the fabric back, causing the drape along the bottom to look odd, and unflattering. so sad- i wore it to lunch with my husband, but felt like i was constantly pulling the shoulders/sleeves back into place... i won't pull it from my closet to wear again, very often."
"I tried on the dress that was returned at my store in xxs p, i would not have based on reviews but my stylist asked me to try it on. it does look nice, you just have to cinch it all the way. perhaps most people do need to size down. for my 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5in waist, i wouldn't go up to xs p... to give an idea. 
material is nice and sturdy. give ti a try!"
"This shirt is exactly what i expected! it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great! it's the perfect shirt for summer, loose fitting but in a flattering way. the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colors!

i highly recommend it!"
"So much about this dress is wonderful - the fabric is a nice weight, the color is gorgeous (i got this in the blue), the length on the petite hits right above the knee. unfortunately, i got a 12p - my usual size in antho dresses - and the elastic waistband was on my boobs rather than under them. i've got a sizable bust (36g), so this happens from time to time. i'm exchanging for a regular, which hopefully will have a little more room, but busty gals beware! at least it's not too low cut!"
"I love the way this dress moves on you and the high low. a medium fit me perfectly. i am 5'8"" and the long part in the back barely touches the floor in flat shoes. the colors are sort of fall, but the top is like a sun dress. i think you could wear this any time of year with the appropriate accessories. i wore it with a 3/4 length sleeved cardigan and sandals in oct. and it was perfect. the fabric feels nice, great quality. it's on sale so you have nothing to loose!"
"I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok, something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus."
"While i do love this sweater, it did not fit me as is pictured. the wrap does not lay as smooth and i had to adjust frequently when transitioning from a sitting to standing position. nice weight."
Ok. love this top. i'm 5'4 106 34b and the 0 reg fits perfect on the top half. i am going to have the waist taken in because i love the top. it is very short. i usually need a petite but the regular is just barely long enough. i thought it was red and white but it is red and beige. great with jeans or navy for work.
This looks beautiful and fits true-to-size. the material has enough weight so that it hangs well. this is a very form-fitting dress - i wouldn't recommend it to someone uncomfortable with a close fitting style.
Love this shirt. i am 5'8 and have a slender torso and the small fits perfectly. i love that it's long so you can wear it as a single shirt or use it as an extra layer. i also have a grey druzy necklace to dress this puppy up. purchased it in black and this will be a new staple.
"From quality, to design, and overall comfort...these leggings have it all. they are so so soft and feel and look amazing on. i bought the black and i love the ribbed detailing. it's just enough to add a little something. i ended up buying the other two colors and another pair of black! for the price it's more than worth it."
"I had read a few reviews on this shirt before ordering that said it ran small and was shorter than it looks. i thought it was worth finding out because i really liked how this shirt looks in the pictures on the store site. unfortunately, when i got it in the mail and opened it up i found out that all the earlier review were right.

it is much shorter than the dimensions implied in the pictures of the model. i was expecting a tunic style shirt that could be worn over leggings or skinny jeans th"
"I have a few evening functions this month and the next few months and i thought this dress would be different and fun. i really wanted to like it, but i could not. there were spots missing sequence, some fell off as i tried the dress on, and i did try it on twice. each time there were some on the floor. they are sewed on so poorly, for the price of this dress. i fear it would be a dress for one season and i'd have to throw it out. not for that price. so back it goes."
"The print is unique and fun. however, the longer length and heavier weight of the fabric was not the piece i needed in my closet."
A really great basic that can be styled a number of ways. i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it. the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look.
These are very comfy and can be worn casual or dressed up. love the pom poms.
"This is a great quality top. it did not look great on me, since i am quite top heavy. but is lovely."
This dress ladies is simply amazing and perfect!!!
"I ordered size medium. the fit is true to size. the color and pattern work beautifully with the delicate yarns and design of this sweater. as other reviewers have stated, it is very thin and lightweight. in my opinion, it serves more as an accessory rather than it being functional as a cardigan worn for warmth. when i tried it on, i considered whether it would provide any warmth at all...summertime air conditioning, etc. the answer is no... if i decide to keep it, it will be for its aesthetic..."
I ordered these online. i usually wear a 4-6 depending on the brand. i ordered the 6 and love the way they fit as i didn't want them tight. they have a lot of stretch and the fabric is nice quality.
"I have had my eye on this coat for a while and then my size (0) was sold out. when it popped back i ordered it. i am 5'4"" and i had wondered if i needed the petite (petite 0 was sold out) because of all the reviews i had read. however, the sleeve length is perfect. in a petite, the sleeves would be too short. i don't have long arms so i am surprised some reviewers have complained about the sleeves being too long. the button placement is not at the waist but that is the style! the lapels are long"
"Soft, versatile comfort. what more could you want in a legging?"
"Yes, as much as i'd have liked this to be a true red, it's kind of red-orange; i am relieved, however that it is not as orange as it looks on my monitor! that is my only slight-and i mean slight-disappointment in this cute-as-all-get-out skirt! i am 5""5"" 140 lbs and the six is perfect, leading me to believe that this is tts. it is a polyester mix with a same-color liner, large buttons followed by smaller, silver colored buttons at the apron. the larger buttonholes are red and white striped and t"
"I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that's what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it wouldn't really look right but omg, it's 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans, leggings, jeggings, whatever and it's just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt."
"I found this skirt ran very small and i had to go up a size from what i usually wear. maybe it is meant to be worn really tight as the fabric seems to contain a lot of spandex. i really like the longer length. it feels like a good sturdy fabric. i haven't washed it yet, but i'm hoping it doesn't fade or shrink."
"I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit, but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!"
"I ordered this dress for my engagement photos and i am so excited to wear it! it's a gorgeous dress, a bit fancy. it drapes so nicely on the body. as previous reviews have stated, it's a little snug in the chest and shoulders so you might want to size up. i typically wear a size 4 in dresses and fairly small chested, and i decided to stick with the small in this dress. i probably would have been a little more comfortable in a medium as it's a little tight in the shoulder area still. overall thou"
"The heart version is very pretty, i can't speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person. i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs, as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short. the xs was a little big on me. the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me, like 3/4 length, not to elbow as shown on model. but i don't want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that size.

for reference, i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist, and short."
"I chose to ignore the other reviews saying this shirt was too wide thinking that my wider shoulders would fill it out, but that's not the case. the shirt is adorable and soft and cute on, but just too wide around the armpit/chest area and with the horizontal stripes it just didn't look attractive. i would love to try the next size down to see if it works, but the black and white xxs is sold out so back it went. i am only 5'4"" with a shorter torso so the length was fine for me."
Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.
"At 4""11 i usually have to order items in petite and sometimes still have trouble fitting properly into items but i was able to buy this sweater in an xs! i figured with the high front and low back i wouldn't be able to fit it but it looks great on. not only is the fit amazing, but it feels amazing as well. it's such an easy wear and the high/low look is effortlessly chic!"
"I tried on a returned 24p in my store, they were almost the right length, but the fit was more snug than pictured here (i have muscular thighs/butt, and 115 lbs). they were nice though, kind of a skinny pant. the carbon is a dark grey, can go with anything... only gripe is the waist height is low, at least on the behind... i would certainly show if i bend down without a long top."
"I really liked this top. ordered the blue and am considering getting the pink color. 5'4, 135lbs, ordered xxs and it fit great. has nice drape around hips and not too snug."
This is a great beach/pool or lounge piece. i debated keeping but couldn't pass up how comfortable it was. hugging without being tight. i will probably only wear it with some sort of layer like a jean jack or tied shirt rather than undone unless on on the beach but it's so comfortable. straps are a bit long.
"This piece was so gorgeous that i bought it despite how impractical it is to wear it in honolulu. it's honestly the perfect little number to wear if you want to go for a late autumn/early winter stroll in the city. it's incredibly comfortable and versatile. i've worn it on cool mornings in honolulu as a dress with booties, and a few months ago, i wore it to minneapolis and added leggings and a warm pea coat. depending on how you choose to accessorize the look, it can be casual or professional. i"
Love this dressed up casual tshirt. perfect casual friday shirt or going out for happy hour with the girls.
"This long sleeved tee is soft and beautiful. the swing design is so pretty and flattering. the seams along the front and back are a lovely addition. i also appreciate the higher neckline, which is increasingly hard to find in these kind of tees. would love it in more colors. i bought the black. i tried the white as well, but it was too transparent for this particular style and the tank top underneath gave it a sporty appearance. not horrible, but not what i wanted, so the white went back."
"This is a great piece, which has flow, grace, and charm. the blue is a beautiful color! i love it and received numerous complements after wearing it one time."
"With my 5'9', hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts:
_________
pros:
- lots of stretch and comfort.
- pockets! always a plus in my book :)
- will go with any top.
- nice length. fit me as in the model.
- very slimming.
- you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi"
I was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful. the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer. then i tried it on ....to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely. it was a total joke. this dress is for very small chested only.
"True to form, this retailer sweater hits the mark! it's light weight, stylish, great for a shorter person like myself, and has cute detailing. the sleeves are little long, but i push them up anyway and the cream color i bought goes with everything. the xs size is more comfortable and flattering than the s if you are short. i would have bought the bluish gray color of this sweater, too, but already own a similarly shaded and textured sweater from retailer from last year...love that one,"
Morher jeans are my favourite! they are soft and fit great. make my saggy butt look good! they do stretch with wears but shrink again in the wash. they do shrink quite a bit so don't dry all the way! i recommend mother to all!
"I love the idea of this top, but wish there wasn't so much fabric. i am wearing a medium in the photos and for reference my measurements are 38-30-40."
"The breast and arm area is too tight. best to size up two sizes. the blouse runs too small overall. the color is a darker blue than pictures in the photo. it's a pretty blouse, and great quality."
"I happened to see someone purchasing this top in the green at my local retailer store, and the sales associate told me they had just gotten then in and they were already almost gone. they only had one left, in size s. it fit, but was a bit too long for me so they ordered the sp for me. it's perfect! the color says turquoise, but it's actually more of an emerald green. it's a bright saturated color, much more beautiful than the online photo. i have green eyes and love the way it brings them out. it"
"Great sweater to brighten those gloomy winter days. this is a beautiful sweater, soft, colorful. perfect."
"I bought this in a size 0 which is my usual retailer size. the lace is nice quality, not rough or scratchy. i purchased the ivory which does have some blush accents which make it look ""vintagey"". it will be perfect for the holidays or all fall/winter. i like that the peplum doesn't seem to flair out much. very pretty!"
"This is a simple shirt, but so cool and comfortable in the hot florida summer! i'm ordering one in the blue and white as well... i know this is going to be a fave. i love supima cotton, and though i adore retailer, i do wish they'd carry more of the supima rather than the non-organic fabrics. so many of the pretty things i simply will not buy, because i prefer the feel of silk, linen and cotton. thanks for this one, retailer!"
"This dress is so so cute. i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but that's an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor. the problem is that the dress isn't lined. it's made of thin, see-through cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination. for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit cover-up. without a slip underneath it (if you can find a strapless one) it is unwearable in most social settings. it's such a sha"
I absolutely love this jacket! i wear it almost everyday. works as a cardigan or a jacket. my favorite retailer purchase so far:)
"I bought this a few weeks back. when i saw it (the blue one) in the store i touched it and it was extremely soft and even plush like. i tried it on and found it odd that this cloth and stone garment, like other viewers stated fit my bust and hips, typically they don't. i love the side buttons. i wear mine opened half way. my only complaint is i've washed it like the instructions state and my blouse is no longer as soft as it was before, and it needs to be ironed as it wrinkles easily. i still li"
"I purchased this skirt on a whim as an option for the up and coming hoiday party season and was plesantly surprised. it is very well made,a medium weight taffita material, and best of all, it has pockets! i just love the combination of colors in the skirt; navy blue, grey, and ecru stripe. i paired the skirt with a taylored white dress shirt and statement necklace for a classic look but also imagine it combined with a dressy t-shirt cut as well. buy it while you can!"
"I love the style and look oft this blouse but the fit is a bit off for me. i'm usually either a l or xl. i don't think it came in an xl so i decided to give the l a shot. i would say it runs roomy except through the arms. i found the arms to run strangely tight...and it's not an area i usually have a problem with. the body skimmed nicely over my trouble spots (middle). i found the neckline very flattering and it laid nicely over by dd bust. the v is deep but you don't feel overexposed. 

the b"
"First, let me say that the photo does not do this exquisite print justice! the fabric is worth framing! on a white ground, the tones of rose, pink, purple and touches of blue make it even more fabulous! the fit is a tad large, as i am 5' 3"" and usually an size 6, but must size up to 8 or m because of my chest. even zipped, it is a tad big, but nothing that i cannot deal with. i don't really see the swing in the dress, as it does not flare out in any way, but is certainly is loose and flowing, bu"
"Love the color and design but way to small. i can wear a small in many manufacturers but certainly not in this one. the medium was like an extra small. sorry because i liked what i saw in the advertisement.
as an older lady i love your well made, fresh, styles but need to be able to trust that a size is true to form."
"I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8, my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style."
"I wanted so badly for this dress to work on me. the design is amazing. the detail is so pretty and delicate. its my version of the perfect little black dress! however i have very big arms...and while i could have easily sized down for the body of the dress, the arms and chest in my normal size did not fit at all. i'm usually a 14-16 in dresses. i tried the 16 and it just didn't work. the arms were way too tight. however i've seen this dress on many other women with smaller arms than me, and they"
"I love the color (coral/pink) and the open shoulder design of this top, but it's too blousy at the bottom (way too much fabric). i ordered a small. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs. i might try an xs if they still have them in stock. fabric is comfortable. the ties on the sleeves add a special touch."
This top has beautiful subtle metallic bits in the pattern. fell in love with the fabric. looks great with high-waist pants.
I absolutely love this dress! it's great for business casual. it's also such a great color for the transition into fall.
"I love this dress because it is different and unique. i agree with others that the torso runs tight. i got lucky and it still fits snuggly. i think that's the look the upper part should get with the bottom more a-line and flowy. 
it's super cute though. the material is truly jeans material, therefore quite heavy and think. maybe not a dress for summer. more spring or fall with a little sweater."
"Cute tee shirt but it runs very large.i ordered a small and probably an xxs would have fit.unfortunately i have to return it.for reference i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs."
"I really like the pilcrow denim military jacket. fabric is comfortably soft, but the jacket is still structured. love the tie detail in the back and the contrasting sleeves. i wear either a small or medium. i tried both sizes with this jacket and decided on the medium to allow for an extended season wear."
"The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece. i am 5'6"" 125lb and i took a 6. a 4 might have been ok, but i felt more comfortable in the 6, and it had a really nice fit.

the quality is good, but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges, so i'm not sure how it will wear."
"Les fauves is another version of last years larkhill swing dress but better.  one, the swing has less to swing, but in a good way!  they reduced the voluminous amount of material while retaining the fun swing aspect. two, the dress is shorter so it's more flattering to the vertically challenged like me. what's the same?  still wonderful silk, discreet pockets, beautiful abstract floral print and those horrid little buttons that are difficult to fasten on the back of a tight neckband collar.  i h"
"Soft and flowy. fit is great. quality is great. i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well. i haven't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first. highly recommend.
i paired this with 4"" short black suede boots and black tights. many compliments (even from my husband and he doesn't usually pay much attention)."
"This tunic fits exactly as shown and is so comfortable. the fabric is soft and buttery, and the lace up front is a awesome detail. happy that i went with the non-denim color because it's a gorgeous rich color that i think will transition well from season to season. love a good, cutr machine-washable tunic!"
"Gorgeous! this dress fit so well and it super flattering. i got it in green and the colors are just lovely. i had to get it hemmed because i'm short and i couldn't find it in petite, but definitely worth the extra cost. i love, love love it."
"I couldn't wait to get this dress! i bought it and was instantly disappointed when i took it out of the bag. while the fabric was beautiful, the sizing was way off. this dress claims to be 35"" long, and i could tell instantly it wasn't. it barely covered my rear. i also know it's supposed to be flowy, but it was really, really wide. i can see this working for someone around 5 feet tall who is wider."
"I love this dress. the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments. i also love it's made in the usa. my only wish is that the chambray version was as great. (it's not - the pockets are cut bad, it's cut smaller in the chest, and made in china)"
This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person. the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos. the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections (but not too heavy...) length as shown on model.
"The embroidery and side zip were well constructed. the fabric holds onto wrinkles and creases, so after a period of sitting, there are several creases pointing to one's crotch area. this isn't too noticeable, but definitely makes this a more informal garment."
I ordered this dress for my daughter. she wore it to a wedding and it was beautiful. looks just as it does in photo. fabric is a nice weight and hangs great. my daughter had her hair done and look right out of an retailer catalog. well made true to size beautiful dress!!!!!!!
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 140 lbs and 38 (36d) - 32- 40. i'm normally a size 10 in most brands, and in maeve in the past. this dress was too tight across my waist and hips in a size 12, so it runs very slim.

2. this dress is very long waisted, so the top bunched up funny.

3. the horizontal bar in the back is in the wrong place, and will not hide your bra strap.

4. there are bra strap keep loops in the shoulders, but this is an off the shoulder top.

5. the underarms bunched funny.

6. the dress has h"
"I'm 5'4'', between sizes 12 and 14. i ordered a size petite large, and it's a bit loose, which is acceptable, but i'd like to try a regular size medium to see if it'd be more fitted like i see in the model.
my problem is with the length. i read the description and it says petite = 40.5'' of length. the large petite i ordered is above my knees, this is not 40'' of length by any means, it's 36.5''.
i'd really appreciate if the size info was correctly available."
"I love this jumper! i'm 5'1"" and the 00p fit beautifully. i needed no alterations. i found it true to size. i can see that if my torso was any longer, it wouldn't fit though. i found the quality of the fabric was nice, it just gathers slightly, but you can see that on the model too in the photo. that doesn't bother me."
"This top is very pretty, but it doesn't make up for the problems with it. retailer seems to be suffering from quality issues as of late. the sizes are all over the place and items i have purchased don't seem to hold up to normal use and washing. i normally wear a medium in tops. the medium in this top was huge. i needed an extra small, which means a lot of people are sized out of this top. i hand washed this top in cold water as the tag indicated and it shrunk! it shrunk so much that i can"
I absolutely love this top! cute and feminine without being over the top. i basically love everything meadow rue puts out there...and this was no exception.
"Love the muted pattern in the blue and spots of gray, front and back. i wore this with my gray legging/pants. the pleats allow for a relaxed fit; very comfortable over all."
"I was skeptical about buying a romper. i was also unsure what size would fit me (i'm 5'5"" and 150 lbs.)  to my delight, the romper fit perfectly! it's a gorgeous and flattering fit.  i love the design and fabric!  it's stunning!"
"I love sweater knit dresses and this the first one i've owned with a flare style that works. pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a non-obvious way. i think the fabric is soft and warm. i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint. you may want to size down if you're not busty. i am 5'3"" and m petite was the perfect length on me. shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in 1.5 days?!?!?!!!"
There's just the right amount of billowy grace in this dress. the fit is perfect and the material moves and breathes with you. cute with a jean jacket on chillier days too.
"I ordered a small, but it was way to big. it was very soft."
"I was immediately drawn to the ochre yellow color of this dress and it's stitch and pleat details and was happy to score it early enough in the season still in my size and preferred color option. unlike other reviewers, i was not turned off by the ribbing at the neck and arm lines. i received the dress yesterday, am wearing it today, and have already received compliments from even the most sour-faced co-workers who can't give a compliment or share casual conversation in the hallway. the sunny ye"
Lovely dress in bright teal color. the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned. unfortunately i sized up (6) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size(4). the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues. this is really a great buy with the current sale. tempted to pick up the red version too.
"I fell in love with this online and i'm so thrilled that it's even more beautiful in person. it is a stunning, very dark teal velvet with the most gorgeous embroidery. perfect fit, quality, and nicely lined. a keeper for years to come! i think it's true to size (for reference i'm 5'1, 100 lbs and the 0p fits perfectly)"
"I love this dress. i found it to run one size big. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and went down a size to a 2. i purchased both a 4 and 2, then tried them on a few times, and the smaller size didn't pull at all because it fit me right, the larger one, hung lower and didn't look right. i received compliments all night when i wore this and paired it with black heels and a small back clutch. very comfortable too."
"I think this blouse would work for petites. it is super short and boxy. looked nothing like the fit on the model. sad to return it, love the print."
I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.
"Just be prepared: this is huge! i looked hilarious in my normal 00p. this was in store, luckily, the the excellent personal stylist warned me. i also don't think the colors are as good in person - bit dull. if it fits you, it could be nice."
"I am 5'6"" and the neckline barely covers my bra -- would have to wear a cami with it. the fabric is soft, and the colors are very pretty. but the neckline is too low for me for a casual top."
"This top is beautiful on. i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory, of which i tried both on. i purchased the black as it was more stunning. i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect. it has a nice pleat in the front, in case you have a teeny bit of tummy. i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top. it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings. the body fabric is a lighter cotton. i am 5'4"" and it hits at hip length. it does not have"
This top runs huge. not only in the torso/chest area but the sleeves on this were enormous and the shoulder area was very puffy. i am normally between a m-l but would have to get a small or extra small to make it work.
"This is a very nice top, however, it was too large for me. i ordered a medium and needed a small. i am 5'9"",145 lbs.i will try again with a small."
Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!
"I bought this sweater to wear with leggings for fall and winter.  the quality is nice, but the color is a bit different than the pic.  it has more brown than true berry in it.  it is very soft and stretchy, but is a bit boxy on.  i am debating whether to keep it or not.  it was a little cheaper with my birthday discount applied, but not sure i'd keep it if it was full price."
"I really love this dress but i am still struggling with keeping it or not. i have an hour glass figure with a somewhat fullish behind :). it is tight around that area which i think it is meant to be but i am not sure how comfortable i am with that. i wasn't sure about the belt but it really works. i am 5""3 and weigh 118. i did have to size up from 2p to 4 p for it not to feel too tight in all areas."
"I ordered a size 10 in the neutral motif and it fits perfectly and it looks great. i am 5'9"" 145lbs with 38"" bust. the sleeves are the perfect length. i couldn't be happier with this purchase."
I loved the beautiful print! the sleeves were beautiful as well and added a unique quality to the shirt. i also liked the longer length of the shirt. i ordered online and kept it!
Size down on this top. bought it online and when i took out of the packagei quickly put it back in. you could have put 4 of me in the xs. i think even an xxs would be huge. extremely boxy!! i recommend it only if you can find the correct size.
"Love the color of this dress, however found it a little boxy, and the arms are too tight. i ordered up a size ( m) which is probably why it is boxy and i can hardly get it over my arm, i am very athletic. probably should have sent it back."
"I have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was 40% off. i ordered a size m petite, sadly when it arrived and i tried it on, it was very boxy, stiff like, and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back."
"I am obsessed with these jeans! i have them in 3 washes and hardly ever wear any of the other jeans in my closet now. they are truly the perfect skinny jeans. you can dress them up with heels and a cute top, or down with a slouchy sweater and boots, or even throw on with a simple tee and flats. i love that they are low rise, as i am short waisted, and often find the front rise too long on many styles. the backside is also super flattering, and the back pockets are the perfect size and shape...no"
"Spied this dress in my local retailer and figured i would try it on for overall fit before ordering the petite on line. for some reason retailer has eliminated in-store petite items (so disappointing). i was pleasantly surprised the xs regular fit well and was soon in my checkout pile. the dress is very soft although i suspect it will wrinkle when packed in a suitcase. the color blocking is great and makes this dress so versatile for spring, summer and fall. the xs regular fit my 5'1"" 115 lb"
"This was exactly what i was looking for: a spring dress i could wear while it was still cool out. loved the colors, pattern, and the fact that it could hide a belly bulge. but i got it in a petite small, and i was swimming in it. i got it in an xs, and the body of it was just right, but the bust was so tight i nearly ripped it trying to climb out (and i'm a barely an a cup). i don't normally have this problem with dresses, but in this case the top and bottom half of the dress felt like they were"
"I ordered my typical 6 petite and found that the buttons were pulling at the bust ( i'm 34 b) and at the waist. i'm returning and ordering a size 8 petite because i'm a sucker for a shirtdress and a cute novelty print. the quality is nice and the length was perfect for my short 4""11 frame, now only to wait for it to be shipped! oh how i wish petites were available in my local store!"
"I really loved the look of these color blocked leggings online, but when i received mine, they're nothing like the ones in the pictures....the front of the legs on mine are mostly orange with a thin strip of white between the orange, then more orange!!! i like orange, but really was expecting the pretty color blocking like in the pictures not, mostly orange on both front legs, the back of the legs have more color blocking, but barely any of the light lavender color"
"I do like this top. i bought the cream color and it is flattering, but it is a little shear. i need to wear a cami underneath it. it also seems to be a little on the large side."
I loved the texture and look of this skirt. very classy. but it fits tight-- i usually take a 4 or 6 on skirts depending on where the waistband hits and i could barely squeeze into the 4 and could not get it zipped. i'd need to go a size bigger in this one but now it's unavailable :(
"This is a beautiful sweatshirt. that is a sentence i've never said before! mine arrived with the sleeves rolled up, which made me think they probably pulled it off a mannequin or something. it made the sleeves sort of loose at the bottom, so i am hoping that they will ""draw up"" a little once i wash it. kind of bummed about that: for almost $100, they could have at least steamed it out or something so i could see the authentic fit. the sweatshirt is a little more square-fitting than it looks in t"
"This is a cute work jacket, as well as paired with jeans.  flattering. very soft.  only con is this is thick with a soft cotton lining, so not great for summer in az, but will get plenty of use this fall. typically 6-8 on the top, i went with medium.  not tight in the arms as other reviewer noted."
"Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros, and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer, i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!"
"Adorable skirt but fit is definitely too tight like the other reviews before me 
 i am super petite 4 11 105 pounds the double zero and zero were just a little tight for me and a little too long ( both could fit around my waist which is a 24 but high waisted and tight not a fit around the hips)
 if  the length had been above the knee i might have kept  the zero but they were both returned 
 great skirt in the theory  with the wrong  waste fit and length"
Cute top; somewhat sheer but color and fit are great. fits slim but true to size.
"It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint, but it's totally worth it. this is a fabulous sweater coat. i receive compliments on it wherever i go. so cozy, warm & delicious. not too hot to wear indoors either. it's breathable. love it. bought in green during black friday sale. highly recommend."
"Really cute and comfortable. i have worn these a couple of times and get several compliments! worth every penny, and now they are on sale!"
I saw this dress in the store window and gave it a try. i found it to be super flattering and feminine. the bodice is form fitting and the skirt flares out to a full skirt. the colors are fun and vibrant. the neckline is a bit low for work but perfect for evening. it is true to size.
Worth every single penny. size up - they are very tight!
Love this! fits great. warm and soft. would recommend
"This dress is the absolute best. it is comfy, flattering, cute - pretty much the best dress ever. as a previous reviewer said, ti is a 3 - even 4 - season dress. throw it on with boots and a wool cardi in the winter and youre all set. i didnt even think twice about buying it. perfect length- a little longer in the back but not too short in the front (and i do not like short dresses/skirts). dont think about it... just buy."
Nice flowing summer sun dress. i was looking for something very simple and put a colorful kimono over. it. i put a bando under it. i think this dress can be for all ages as my friend in her 20s bought and loves this dress as well.
"The fit on these is good for my hourglass shape, and the fabric quality and comfort is good too.i think the rinse is just not as nice in person- the orange stitching is pretty bright too. i bought. a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality, fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these. i am going to return these and see if they have something better , but will only buy in store from now on."
"So glad to see high waisted jeans again! very soft, very comfortable, and the raw edge hem makes them just edgy enough!"
"I bought this dress during the retailer weekend and i'm so happy i did!  this is a very well-made, well-designed dress that is quite figure flattering.  the marriage of artsy and colorful on a neutral background makes sense and the combination of colors and the style of the dress work well together.  the wearer will definitely have several options for footwear pairings.  this dress is as fun and playful as it is classy.  i can't wait for an occasion to wear this dress!"
"I am so glad i did not wait to order this dress. the fit is great and is made with great material. i am 5' 7"", 110 lbs and ordered a 0. often i have to have a dress altered but it is not the case with this dress. the length falls right at my knee. it is not shown in the photos of the dress but it has a buttoned back slit that has two buttons with a bright orange trim along the slit. a very cure feature. the bright blue back drop is hard to see on the photos as well but is nice."
I got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design.  i like it so much more than i expected to!  the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;t stick out too much.  i love the green color too!  i tie the ties on the back of the dress--at the level of my shoulder blades--rather than on top as in the photo.  i think it looks cuter that way.  so glad i took a chance on it!
"Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm, just not super soft, but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily."
"I have this in the blue/teal color, and i love it, so far! i'm considering buying it in other colors. this tee is stretchy, comfortable, and soft, even after being washed a few times. it fit true to size on me (xs), although it's a bit form-hugging, so if you want a looser fit, consider sizing up. the only thing about the blue is that it's not quite as dark as in the photo on the website. i wish retailer would make these kinds of basic tees more often!"
"I finally bought this top after eyeing it in the store for sometime. the design adds a bit of edge to a top that could get matronly very quickly. it goes great with a nice pair of jeans and some pumps - you're ready for a night out! my only critique is that i'm a bit busty (38c) so in the center of the top where the v of the neckline meets the shirt, there is some pulling. it's not completely noticeable, and doesn't make it uncomfortable in the least. love this shirt and so happy i finally indul"
"I ran to the store to try to this on after seeing it online. i'm usually between a small and medium on tops depending on the shirt; the 6 fit true to size. everything about this shirt fit perfectly and it is beautifully designed, but it is just soooo sheer. i had a nude bra on and you could see every detail of it through both the front and back. i couldn't wear this comfortably without a cami. disappointing as i had the highest hopes for finding a crisp white shirt for the summer!"
"This dress is a keeper. fits true to size, comfortable and love the pockets. it can be a casual day dress or add some jewelry for a night time dinner out. i was concerned with the fabric being a velvet material but is very light and comfortable"
I received this top yesterday and love it! sexy yet not too revealing and great for date night! i like the way it fits across the chest and isn't too short in the waist. very soft fabric.
I absolutely love this sweater. it will take me into spring and right on in to summer beach bonfire nights. a great staple!
"Love the mara hoffman basketweave bikini bottoms in fractals red. i went to her website for the size chart and got these in a size 'm'. very good fit, just a bit cheekier than her classic cut bikini bottoms. i got them with the matching basketweave bikini top.
.
i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 to 38 depending on where i measure. upper hipbones are 34""; fuller thighs and bottom, so i never know what to order. i think a size 's' would be too skimpy so i hope these hold up well in the waves.

"I like how styling and comfortable it is, i bought it in both colors. definitely a nice piece for fall/winter in this houston weather."
Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.
"I tried this top on in the store before i ordered it online. i'm a size 2/4 (varies), and i ordered it in a size 2. i've been searching the perfect, fitted, white, button-down blouse for weeks, and i love this top! it's figure flattering, true to size, and a cute, classy alternative to your basic white button down. i can't wait to wear it! =]"
"Very cute dress, just way too big. i ordered it online, wish i would have gone a size smaller."
"I am pleased with this modal cowl neck top; it is a very basic but is a nice addition to my wardrobe. the cowl is just right-not overly 'chunky' or awkward; it drapes nicely and lies flat against my chest. this blouse 'softens' the face-just what i was looking for-i needed a soft-looking black tee to go with a skirt i have and wanted a bit 'more' than a basic tee but nothing overly frilly or ruffled. this blouse filled the bill quite nicely. it is a very soft modal fabric and fits tts. i am 5'5"""
Great pants. i'm 5'6 and about 130. the size 2 fit nice at the waist and loose in the thigh. they hit right at the ankle. the colors are nice/ muted. the details are great. overall great pants.
"I didn't thoroughly read the description of this product, so when it arrived i was surprised to see the thread was sparkly. i tried it on and the neckline is absolutely beautiful and feminine. it looks like a masculine cut on the model, but it's actually a really beautiful neckline with flared flowing bottom to it.

my only complaint is that it looks a tad longer on the model then it is is real life. i'm 5'9"" and it shows most of my behind, unlike the length of the model where it seems more like"
"These are great pants. i love the fit and the taper of the leg. these will be my ""go to"" black pants for the fall season!"
"These jeans are perfect in every way. the rise is perfect, the stretch is perfect. we need more washes in this exact fit. i wish there was more consistency between pilcro denim washes of the same style!"
"I think i will really love this skirt. it is comfortable and has a lovely sheerness to it. it does have a bit of a weird, long drop waist, but it is very comfortable and still manages to be flattering. i think this will be a great piece for transitioning to the fall and winter seasons. i can wear it with short sleeves now and sweaters soon. i am happy with my purchase."
"It is hard to believe that this is called a chemise! it is a fabulous dress! this dress caught my eye in the store and i had to try it on. i went with the navy, which is beautiful and has a great pattern. i had to order a petite xs because the regular xs was loose in my shoulder area. i am petite and narrow and 5'1"". the petite xs was perfect for me. it is quite form fitting and does show curves, lumps and bumps so i wore my dress with spanx tights. it was such an easy dress to wear, looked styl"
Just as beautiful as in the picture. it is warm and the best part is that it is not itchy! love it and cannot wait to wear it as the weather changes.
I think this jumpsuit is different! the xs fit well and the material is a pretty color but very soft. the store had it styled with a metallic scarf that really accessorized it well.  i thought it would be great for my date night but stopped short of buying because i just can't picture this worn to other outings.  it is very unique though so i just might be back to purchase.
"This dress has a beautiful shape. it was a onesie in a store (only one they had) and i'm glad i tried it on. usually i'm a 6 or 4. this is an 8, and it's a perfect fit. definitely size up at least one dress size. the knit shoulders are beautiful and the belt is slimming. i love the writing on it. it's a classic dress and it makes me feel beautiful and unique."
"Didn't work on this curvy gal.
sizing up would have helped with the button gaps, but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size.
major pass."
"I love it!!! i can wear out to dinner or just out to lunch with
friends!"
"These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my ""go to"" pants, but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them, size down and suffer through the first few ""tight"" hours! trust me...they will"
"I know i'm going to get a lot of wear out of this t-shirt this summer. i have it in white, and it's not too see through, which is what i always worry about when i wear white shirts. it's basic but then it has lace on the shoulders that adds something extra. i love its drape--it's not too form fitting. on me (i'm 5'2), it tends to be a bit long, but i like it. the shirt being cotton means that it's super soft. as far as washing goes, best practice is to machine wash and hang to dry--i'm afraid of"
"Great top - i have both colors. because the front is 'short' i ordered a medium. i usually wear a small. if you are not long waisted, like me, order the small."
"This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top, but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously, i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out."
"I got this cute tunic in-store in the coral color during a 25% off sale items promotion. it's a fun, quirky piece with mixed fabrics, and can be worn alone with leggings or layered with a jacket, skinny jeans and boots. a versatile piece, it does have a few issues. i found he armhole to be slightly large on my petite frame, even in the xs; not a deal-breaker, but a bit of a pet peeve for me. i'll probably end up wearing cami under it most of the time, since the top knit portion is a somewhat loo"
"Great, really soft hoodie. i got an xxs petite and it's still a little big, but it works. i'm 5'1"", 95lbs."
Nice quality. too big for my taste. really liked the style but sleeves were very long.
"Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s, but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school), and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings, but its not too bulky so i can keep it on"
"Was really excited to get this, but got it on and i was swimming in it. i'm not a tiny girl thicker athletic build and the large was massive. sadly had to return. don't know if i'll try a size down."
"I ordered this sweater in green, and it was a lovely soft color. the style of the sweater was nice -- really deep side splits made it feel trendy. the sweater is a great length, nice fabric and the side splits are appealing. however, it was just so, so big that i couldn't pull it off -- i just swam in it. i am 5'8"" and 118 lbs, fairly wiry?.even the xs didn't work for me. perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman. i even considered having it tailored, since i've had a hard time find"
"I have been looking for a tan color skirt so i ordered this as soon as i saw it. so glad i did the deep camel color can still be worn in late summer as styled in the product photos and transition to fall staple. the material is nice weight , and has a stretch. the cut has a little 60's vibe that i love. i think it should keep it's shape hopefully launders well. i think it runs slightly large, as my waist is large in comparison to my hip proportion and there is no pinch for me. i will rebuy this"
"I find that every year (or two at the most) i have to find a new favorite black dress or two (fading, etc.), and, this is definitely one of those dresses for this year (almost one to buy another, so i have one that looks good in a year or two)! the dress is all around flattering and comfortable... looks wonderful with high heels and flats, looks good at work and while out having fun! probably won't be able to count how many times i wear it this year!"
"Lovely palette and and fabric but the cut did not flatter my shape. the flowy cut broadened my silhouette and hit at my waist making me look bigger than i actually am. the overall effect was quite frumpy in spite of the flamboyant pattern. perhaps a better choice for someone built exactly like the model.
i will be returning it."
The sweater coat would be wonderful for cooler weather this fall. i ordered it in medium because the small sizes were sold out. sometimes a medium is the right size depending on the brand. i was disappointed that the coat was so large; i don't think it will work for me even with layers underneath. it's a great design but i may have to return it.
"This can take you from office to casual afternoon. i got the plaid print in store. it is much nicer in person than in the picture. very cute neckline and detailing. i'd say true to size, slightly large. i wore my regular size and it fits fine without looking too large."
I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.
"I just got this in the mail the other day. i was really excited and then crushed. one, buttons go all the way down and not what is in the photo. it takes it from hip whimsy to granny old lady sweater and then the minute i put it on it started pilling. it looked old and i wore it about 6 hours. i also used the roller lint remover on it and it pulled off one of the eyes on the snail. it is soft and felt comfy but look raggy and therefore it is going back. too bad but not what i bought and then not"
"Great soft basic. low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest. i absolutely love this top, easily dress up and down!"
This dress does fit small.. i am generally a size 10-12 in maeve but purchased this in a 14. i have a large chest (34g) which contributed to my need to size up. the green color is beautiful and the dress looks darling on. i have a little trouble with the zipper but nothing that required me to return the dress. my biggest complaint is that the straps are a tiny bit too long and don't lie flat on my shoulders. other than that i receive a ton of compliments every time i wear it!
"These pants are so soft and stretchy they feel like leggings. i love the ankle length as they are perfect to wear with both flats and booties. i am 5'5"" with fairly long legs and these hit right at my ankle. they are so comfortable i have ordered in the green, red and gray. my ""go to"" pants this winter."
This dress was absolutely gorgeous and beautifully made. i ordered a size down as the other reviews stated the dress ran large. however it was massive. i wanted this dress so badly and mourn that i had to take it back to the store.
"I like the casual, yet detailed look of this piece. it looks great with crops. the casual tie string makes the piece feel very laid back, but the details are so pretty. i have it in lavender. it looks way better in person. saw it at the store and grabbed it immediately."
Adorable print! just picked these up in the store yesterday! the print is so pretty and it caught my eye! surprisingly they fit in my usual size for workout pants!
"...for real, reinforce all the buttons before you wear it out. i've had three different ones pop right off."
"I thought the photo of these pants was so cute. when i got them in the mail i opened the package and just began to laugh over how long they were. i held the waist up to my chest, just below my shoulders and the pants still hit the ground. i am not a short woman! i ordered a 14, i am 5' 6"". i also found the waistband a little small in relation to the size."
Nice quality material. the green is pretty color. just a good cozy top. i normally wear a large in retailer clothes and the large in this world was very roomy (which was fine with me). if you are short and have smaller shoulders and bust definitely go for a size smaller than you would normally wear.
"Fell in love with the design of this sweater. its lightweight, appropriately sized, with delicate details. the pockets are somewhat hidden which is a nice feature. the shawl collar falls just right. the unique design in the rear makes it stand out from your standard cardigan. i purchased in rose for a rich color addition to my wardrobe. the xs fit perfectly. i'm 5'3 and typically wear xs in retailer tops."
"I purchased this online because i just loved the gorgeous designs and embroidery. it has a unique cut to it as it has wrist holes but is otherwise open. i have a difficult time keeping it from falling off of my shoulders when i wear it over bear skin. i hope it will stay in place when i wear it over long sleeves or a sweater. overall i am happy with it, but i think it may run small as it hits the model at her wrists but hits me above my elbow. i am not very tall or long-limned so it seems strang"
"I saw this online and was pleased they had it in blue at the store. the blue is more of a gray, but it's a great color. i tried on the small and my daughter said ""you look pretty, mommy."" i was sold! i love the cascade on the side."
"The model in this photo should be standing tall, because this dress looks absolutely fabulous right out of the tissue paper! i ordered a small, and am 130pounds 5'5""- the dress fits like a glove, and is a pull over style. the nude slip- lining connected to the outer shell works wonders and allows for a full coverage feel, yet nice breezy, sexy appeal. this dress can be worn to work, on a hot date, and even a nice weekend look. when i say slimming i mean it. the center detail- grabs the most perf"
"Love this dress. the description says ""pull over styling"" but it's not. there is a side zipper which i think makes for a better fit. i bought a 4 which fit great. i'm 5'4"" 125 lbs and it hits right above the knee."
"I had no idea this was considered sleepwear until after i bought it. i saw it in the store and promptly tried it on, it is really flattering. i wear it as a sweater dress on a regular basis. it is really comfortable, and is something you could dress up with booties or be more casual with cute tennis shoes like keds. i get compliments on it all the time. i also like the slit a lot."
"Great little shift dress! for me it seemed to run true to size. i'm 5' 4.5"" and curvy. the regular size 10 fit perfect, about 3"" above the knee. a really fun design with the fringe. can't wait to wear once the snow is completely gone."
"Stylist in store warned be about issues with buttons falling of easily. loved the look, so bought it anyway. lost 2 buttons on the first wear. it did not feel snug on me, but i guess i could try a size up and see if the buttons hold a bit better. either way i will return or exchange."
"This top reminds me of the special tops i got ""once upon a time""...when retailer adopted a more curatorial approach to their store. this is a beautifully-made top...quite dramatic but comfortable. i've received many compliments each time i've worn it. it has wonderful drapery and movement."
"This beauty caught my eye online and i was excited to see it in store. the coloring is lovely, but it was too short for me (5'7"") and just meh...and it was only on for a second before it started itching. sadly, too, the sleeves were all stretched out from the way my local store merchandised it, which looks cute on the hanger but kind of ruins the clothes (i wish they'd stop doing this). if it works for you, great because it's a decent price for a timeless sweater with an interesting color patter"
"Ordered this top in navy with white irregular dots since it was not available in smaller sizes in the store. i took a chance and ordered an xs and the size and fit are perfect! love the scalloped edge, small side slits and the crocheted detail on the top. great addition to my florida wardrobe!"
"This is a soft, comfortable shirt. it fits like a t-shirt should. i usually buy m but based on other reviews i purchased s. the fit on me in size small is similar to the model in the photo."
"This top is beautiful! it drapes just like the picture with gorgeous details in the back. this is what i expect from retailer! i am 5'4"", 120# and 34b and took my size small so i would say tts. i tried it on with a strapless nude colored bra and it was not visible. give it a try you won't regret it!"
I purchased the moss color in this cardigan. i really love the texture of the material. it is very very soft. my issue with this is the arms. like other reviewers have said they are extremely small! i went up to a large rather than my usual medium and they were still tight. i really wanted this to work but i will probably return due to the arms.
"This is a nice and comfortable shirt. i'm 5'7 and i have triple d size bra and i got my shirt in size m. it fits perfectly and my breasts are not showing too big and the shirt is not too tight. it's more of a casual style, possibly because of the fabric that was made of. nothing fancy but a very nice every-day shirt to go with skinny jeans or a skirt. it covers belly really well and it does look nice and slim around the waist. i'm pretty pleased with my purchase."
"This is a great dress, both in design and comfort. the material is very soft and warm. yet it is also very stylish, and can be dressed up with big necklaces, a belt, and boots. the stylist in the store mentioned wearing it with a vest. it is a great piece that has so many possibilities. i bought it in navy. thank you retailer!!"
"Love the look, beautiful color, great length.  but with many of retailer's lace skirts, dresses and shirts the zipper did not eat to cooperate."
"The fabric is a little stiff, the back looks unusually long compared to the front, and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor."
Love the tee but it is very thin. best for layering
"I ordered this top in my normal size medium, and it was very large. i am 160 lbs, 36b, size 8 top and 12 bottom. it was so pretty, that i took a chance and reordered it in a small. the small on me fits just like the model in the picture. it's pretty lightweight, but is not see through. it is a very wide v-neck, but i am small on top, so it does not bother me. it's such a comfy yet sexy top!"
"I have no where to wear this pretty spring time inspired dress.  fits just as pictured, except that i'm short.  i ordered the 10p so my 36dd chest and wide rib cage fit comfortably.  i'm saving this dress for easter or a fancy bridal shower."
"I bought both colors based on the reviews and really like the prints. however, they are too sheer. i don't want to wear a tank top, but you have to with these tops since they are so sheer. i can also see the fabric tearing easily, it is too delicate. i sent both colors back. what a waste because the prints and colors are good. these tops are also not for busty ladies. i have a big bust, and the top part didn't cover my entire bust and was awkward because the division between the fabrics would st"
"This is such a cute design, but it's so short! it barely hits at my hips. you'd have to wear a layer under it to keep your tummy from being exposed. i'm also not thrilled with the buttons - i am a 34c bra size and the second button was gaping open on the size 4 top. i wish they'd been sewn shut - the neckline is so big, it's not like the buttons need to function. i got the burgundy with pink flowers and the colors are great. too bad it's so short and gapes open at the bust. going back."
"I love, love this top! it's the perfect peplum tee! i would get more if this was offered in more color combos! the stripes add a cute effect to the tee and it's a perfect soft cotton. can't say enough about this one!"
Purchased this sweater in the blue color which is a gray/blue. it runs large as the xs is still quite roomy on me in the body. although the arms are more snug. great quality.
These run so small!! i was dissapointed with having to return my pair. i'm hoping they are replenished back in stock so i can get the proper size.
I wanted to love these pants since i hate super-fitted skinny pants. but they are really oversized. i'm 125lbs and 5 foot 2. so i'm petite but not considered skinny and have well endowed thighs and legs.but the xs was way too big for me.
"I was so excited about this top, super cute and fit perfectly but as soon as i washed it (cold, hand wash, air dry) it shrunk! now it is too short and tight. i did not expect the material to shrink so very disappointed."
"I'm really pleased with this jumpsuit. it has great detailing not visible in the online image and the fabric is so soft and comfortable. the navy is lovely. i'm normally a medium or size 4-6. i ordered the medium online and it was far too baggy, especially on top. i tried on the small and x small in store and the x small fit exactly how i wanted (as worn by the model) and the pants were still long enough. i'm glad i didn't give up on it."
"I was considering this online for days before a ladies lunch date meandered into a brick & mortar location. i had been thinking of sizing up, if i ordered online, just to be sure it wouldn't be too tight or awkward, and when i had looked for it in stores nearby, it was out of stock, but i hadn't thought to look for my tts, which happened to be available in the store where i went. i tried it on, because i was so curious, and it worked!! i love it. it is so easy-breezy. it will be perfect to layer"
"Just got this and i haven't taken it off all night.  i feels like lounge wear, but is so cute and works with heels or flats.  throw a necklace on, a nice scarf or a jacket and dress it up for going out.  it looks exactly like the picture and fits true to size.  i will get a lot of use out of this piece for spring and summer.  nothing is better than something that feels like pjs but looks so stylish!!"
"This is a shift dress, which is a great dress for many people, in a kind of man-repeller way. by saying that, i mean, a really pretty dress that can show off amazing shoes, good legs, a beautiful face and hair. this is not a body con dress. however, when you do such a high neckline and boxy sleeves, you do no one any favors. everyone has a nice neck and decolletage and collarbone. everyone. the neckline needs to open up a bit....i'm not saying v-neck, just a bit lower than this, because it makes"
"Love this shirt! i bought the light blue color and its amazing, fits well i love that its long in the back. very comfortable and loose. thinking of buying it in both pinks."
"This shirt is cute. i like the pleated neck as it makes the top feminine, while still casual. it is made of very soft fabric and drapes nicely. the only issue is that the seam/pleat that runs down the middle is off center. i think the fabric was cut incorrectly so the seam twists to one side after i have it on for a few minutes and move around. i keep having to twist it straight which is very annoying."
"This dress is not only beautiful, it's so comfortable to wear. it's also very flattering. i love that i can wear the dress with sandals or boots. great buy!"
"While i love this top ( beautiful color and pattern) i found it to be a bit short.  if it were a few inches longer i would be thrilled.  i'm 5'8 ,  curvy, and have a long torso-- so that may be the problem. i will say that within 2 hours of wearing this, i had 5 strangers stop me and comment re: how pretty it is. i am keeping it :)"
"I purchased this sweater in camel and love it. the fabric is very soft and lightweight (perfect for warmer climates with chilly but not cold weather). i'm 5'9"" and got a medium, but the sleeves seemed a bit long to me. it's also a bit boxy due to double breasted the cut, so if you have a petite frame it may overwhelm you. otherwise it's definitely a great coat for the money."
"I was excited when i saw these shorts in my local retailer store. i wear a 25 sometimes 26 and i grabbed an xs. however, when i tried these shorts on i was sad to see that they run big and looked baggy on me. they fit, but are really loose. i am probably going to have to return these because they don't come in an xxs. they are great shorts and a perfect length, but make sure you size down."
I bought this top in black n moss. they are of a great quality n love that u don't need a cami under. i do like them very much except that they're a lil too billowy in front for me. when i gathered excess material on the sides it looked much better. the black didn't look as large...black is slimming. i love the neck and the material. haven't decided yet if i'm keeping or returning.
"This looks great on the model but when it arrived, i couldn't believe it was the same jacket. it looks a bit like a really loose garbage bag on me and no amount of adjusting drawstrings is going to fix it. i really wanted to like it, but even the xs/s was too baggy. also a bit worried based on other reviews that it isn't actually a rain jacket and wont keep you dry."
I had this on my wish list as soon as it came in. i just bought it last week and i'm so glad i did. i bought the purple print and it is really pretty. here in northern cal i can wear this almost year round. i am often right between sizes when it comes to deletta tops. this one is a little bit big i'm hoping that the extra room will help keep it cool during our 100 degree days.
I have been searching for these pants my whole life. i have them in several colors. i wear the moss most often. i'd recommend your normal size or size down if in between sizes. they stretch a bit as you wear them. one other thing- after being washed and dried the color has lightened significantly.
"I spend most of my time searching for the perfect pair of jeans (okay, maybe a slight exaggeration, but only slight). finally, the the ag stevie's are it. this is my third pair. now, for more colors..."
"Good quality material. i got size 10 which is a little too big - size 8 would probably be better. very pretty, feminine top. a little too full in the waist/skirt area."
"I like the color of this dress, but its a little thin for fall. on me, the neckline is more round and the sleeves a little cappier. i have dresses in this brand in both a size small and medium. i went with a small in this dress. returning it for a medium."
"I bought all 3 colors and couldn't be happier. love the cut, fabric, and colors. the fabric is light enough to wear in the hot summer of charleston, sc but not so light that you can see thru it. i love flowing tops in the summer that don't stick to you and this cut does that and is flattering as well. i've already work with shorts and a skirt. both looked great. easy to accessorize."
"This top is lovely! exquisite embroidery in a silvery-beige color compliments the deep plum. the fit is close to highlight your curves, while being just a touch comfy. very chic for a jazzed up outfit for a night out with jeans or black pants and your best booties. i wear a size 8 normally and the medium fits me perfectly. my body type is curvy and athletic."
I've worn this shirt approx 3 times to work. each time someone comments on how much they like it. i'm attempting to add more color to my workwear. this shirt tends to swing so much i feel exposed. that is the biggest drawback.
"I purchased this on one of retailer's 40% off sales, and got it for a great price. if you're looking for a pretty, comfortable t-shirt that's a little beyond the basic, this fits the bill. unfortunately the neckline was just a tad wide for me in the xs. i felt like it might show a peek of my bra, and when i adjusted it higher, the soft, stretchy material showed bra lines underneath. that issue, and the fact that the shirt is on the flowy side made it less-than-flattering for my small frame, but i"
"The inseam is advertised as 28"", but they are more like 38"". i was hoping they were for short people, but they are for someone with very long legs, event in my tallest heels, i'd have to get them hemmed! just a warning to my short friends out there. the quality, fit, look was great, but way way way too long."
"Lovely body hugging dress. hits just below the knee. great with boots as shown, or with heels. very soft material and the peppery color is really pretty. i can see myself wearing this to work and out at night. this is a winner!"
"I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering, i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open, as pictured, tied one button, and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.

i debated getting my usual xs petite, but hey, they don't make it in petite, and the stylist thought the loo"
This is a nice flowy dress that i plan to wear in the fall with long boots. i love how light it feels.
"Ordered these in two colors( moss and bronze), same size (26). the moss fit perfectly and the bronze, i can't even button. so very frustrating, particularly when shipping fees are involved. i'm keeping the pair that fit but was hoping to have a couple pairs. perhaps i'll try on another pair in the store. its a nice lean slimming pant that will work from fall through spring. the material is a bit thick for summer. soft and a tad stretchy to allow ease of movement. looking forward to wearing with"
"I originally ordered this in green, and unlike another reviewer, i thought the color was perfect for spring. it is trendy, flattering and fun in green, but perhaps not a color i would wear long-term, so i decided to return it and order it in red and black. i also noted the boxy cut, and if that is what you want, it runs true to size. however, if, like me, you want something a little more form fitting, consider ordering down a size or two (depending on your chest size,) and just carefully shimmy"
"I have purchased many of retailer's henley tees throughout the years. this one is a bit special and just so feminine i had to get it black in my local store. i love the look of the crisp, white, but it was too sheer to wear to work without a cami, and i cannot layer camis in once it gets hot.

anyhow, this shirt is made in my favorite spring/summer tee shirt fabric: 100%s linen. linen gets so soft and drapey over time. the yoke is lace. the arms have a small ruching that is sewn, not buttoned up l"
I think it's a little on the long side and the sleeves are a little tight but otherwise i really like this jacket. it's lightweight for summer and yet more stylish than the other long sleeve things i grab in case i get cold.
"It's still a bit cool here in minnesota. however, it won't be long before i can wear this lightweight, drapey but figure-flattering blouse. i am 5ft 3in and the 0 petite, fits well."
I love this dress and have already worn it a couple times since purchasing. it is great because it has sleeves and i don't have to wear a sweater with it! my only complaint is the lining on the inside is pretty form fitting. i would have liked it to be more flowy like the dress.
"I'll start with saying that it's a beautiful coat- i get tons of compliments and love the color. it runs a little big but it's meant to have to a slouchy, oversized quality to it. my only complaint is that i've had it for about 3 weeks and already one button has completely fallen off and the two inside fasteners already feel loose and very delicate. there's no extra buttons to replace the old one with and i'm worried more of the coat is going to fall apart. super bummed about the construction qu"
So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i'm a petite size 2.
"I'm 5'2 & the length is fine except i'd probably hem if i used for yoga/pilates. but i prefer cropped for those activities, so these are just knock a round lounge pants for me. they are thin, but not in a cheap way. i don't understand why they're called french terry became that's not what i see/feel; but they are sumptuous & soft. i like that the fold over waist part is stitched & keeps its shape. for size reference, , i got the black xxs- i'm 115 lbs, athletic apple & they fit/look great & clin"
"I took a chance on this top because i loved the color and print. it is mostly as pictured, but because i have a larger chest, the peplum didn't hit me in the right place. it would probably work fine for someone thinner with a smaller chest. i was surprised that it was also somewhat sheer, which was disappointing considering the price. i returned it."
"I purchased two pair (navy and sky) for a trip to the caribbean and i'm so glad i tried them on in the store! these are the nicest fitting and most comfortable shorts i own by far. would highly recommend, well made too."
"Once this caught my eye, i couldn't let it go. i kept revisiting it...thinking it was too expensive, probably itchy,
too bulky, a problem if you wanted to eat something.
but the color looked yummy so i finally ordered it....
and i'm so pleased i did! 
the shape is actually easy to wear - it's not chopped. it drapes nicely over my hips and it isn't itchy.
i would not wash the dishes with this sweater on...but you could dress it up with velvet pants for a party or 
more casually with jeans."
This sweater is absolutely beautiful. the shape is very flattering both tied in front and in back. the wool is nice and soft and the color is a nice neutral that will pair well with anything. the stitching is a nice added detail that makes this sweater somethig special. it is a great addition to any wardrobe and i'm thrilled that it is part of mine. i can't wait to wear it!
"I love this romper! it has a retro look to it, is super soft, and has a whimsical retailer print. the  pink color is the perfect shade too. the fit is great and i had no problems getting it on or off."
"I tried on the xs in store i typically need petite) and it was a great length for me, i think petite would be too short for me to wear to work. the xs was a little snug on the waist, but the rest of the skirt fit perfectly, so though it was snug, i think i would still buy the xs. (stretchy band). the cream color/ivory is a nice summery color, not see-through unless you have dark unders. flirty and overall nice and airy for warm summer days. 115 lbs, 26-27 inches waist)"
"Right on trend, easy to wear, but a bit snug in waist. which the vendor gave item specific sizing to make the selection of the size a bit easier."
"I think these look great. i found them on the sale rack and at $50 w/ 40% off, it's a pretty great deal. i plan on wearing with low heels. hope they work out. i will show to boyfriend, get his feedback too."
This is my first pure+good piece. i am not disappointed. i am 125# and a 34c....ordered the small. fits like a dream. love the moss color. nice long sleeves (i will am picky about sleeves). comfortable fabric. the detail at the cuff is lovely. i can see this versatile piece taking me through the entire year.
"I'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations. it's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt. unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny, and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short (it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you (accentuating your stomach and ma"
"I'm so glad the other reviewer also found these small. literally, the largest size i have ever bought. but the style is really cute, sort of dapper british boy..."
"Gorgeous top, and generous to fuller figures. i meant to order an xl but somehow ended up with the l. was positive i'd have to return it, but it was perfect. went back and bought the white. it's one of those wonderful pieces that feels classy and fun at the same time. very flattering fit."
"I took advantage of the sale this weekend & purchased this super cute vest yesterday which made it a more justifiable purchase. it's so soft, fits tts & i just can't wait for cooler weather so i can start wearing it!"
"This sweater is pretty, fits tts, feels soft against the skin and has a good weight to it so cami is absolutely not needed. i particularly like the buttons on the side. you could unbutton to have the sweater feel more swingy and show more of the underlayer. the design in the back is simple and flattering for all figures, i think. this shade of gray is also appealing to me as it's not too light or dark and has a hint of periwinkle undertone to it. the sweater is on the shorter side but i do think"
"I always go w/ black, but deviated this time & so glad i did! quality fabric, not sheer at all. a great layering piece and new staple for the wardrobe. fits tts, sm (i'm 5'2"", 109lbs)"
"This is a heavier weight shirt. it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so, if you don't like loose fitting clothes, this is not for you. it is well made and looks cute with jeans."
"I love the neckline on this - sharp enough for work, but cute for a fun night out too. only complaint is it's soooo flowy on the bottom. i could hide a baby under here for sure. i got the medium thank goodness or it would have been ridiculous. i'm 5'8, 160lbs. great for fall."
"While i love the design, this sweater even in the small is too over-sized for me and was unflattering. it was returned."
"I ordered a size xl. it ran small, especially compared to other retailer xl tops. the quality of the material was great as was the embroidery. i wish it fit because i definitely would have kept it. very pretty tee."
"I love the concept of an airy, flowing sweater that has great detail. this item stole my heart online. however, i am fairly petite (5'3'') and it looked like it was drowning me. the neck line is decently wide and my small frame couldn't hold it up; it kept falling off my shoulders. i ended up returning. i think it would look and feel fantastic though if i were taller and had broad shoulders."
"Saw these in store and had to have them. online pictures do not do them justice. great pattern, fabric and features. can be dressed up or down. sizing is accurate--i am 5' 4"" and 117 lbs and bought an xs. they fit perfectly. wish they had more colors/patterns to purchase."
"I bought this in the blue and you should definitely size down. it runs very large. it's amazingly comfortable and high quality. great length as well (not too short and not too long). it has a partial lining so it's not necessary to wear a slip which i love. i get compliments every time i wear it, even one of the saleswomen in retailer asked me where i got the dress. she was surprised when i told her it was from retailer from online. i liked it so much i just ordered the red plaid."
"I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online, so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers, the fit is odd, huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body, being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug"
Nice piece. the fabric is very stretchy with that heavy luxe kind of feeling. the neck snap placket is genius because when it is snapped up the neck stays up without restricting the throat. nice long lenght too.
"This is a gorgeous dress. it comes with a black silky belt, but mine was too large, which is probably why it is not shown on the model photos. i think maybe it only works if you're on the larger size for the dress. it's very easy to get on and off due to the front zipper. i was worried about bra straps showing on the low cut back, but they actually show more at the broad shoulders. i'm not sure if that's more apparent because i went up on the size to have room at the hips. there is a cute kick p"
"I bought these almost immediately after touching them in store; they were so soft i didn't even need to try them on to know i would love them. i now wish i had tried them on in the store, so i could have learned that the elastic band on the inside isn't sown in, meaning the band will constantly twist and get tangled whenever i put them on/take them off. it's unbelievably annoying. i have to fix them every time i wear them. if i had known this i don't know if i would have purchased them. they are"
"I fell in love with this top in the store and ordered another online. it is very soft and comfortable. the petite tend to run a little short in the front, but the regular is perfect. it's oversized without being frumpy or boxy on my petite frame."
"Love! boys and arrows make amazing suits! i wear a 25/26 in jeans and a size small in this bikini bottom - it actually fits true to size, which seems impossible in swimwear! cheeky for sure, but so cute! fabric is super, super soft. i want to wear these all day long."
"This is the third jumpsuit i've ordered and written a review for this season. this jumpsuit is the best by far. i bought it in my usual size small (32d--31-38) and it fit me, even though i'm tall (5' 8.5""). i would say it looks much the same as it does on the model, maybe an inch shorter in the legs on me. love that the legs are rolled up by a tab and a snap--no uncomfortable elasticized legs. i am more legs than long torso (i usually wear a 33"" inseam with flats). the jumpsuit is very easy to g"
"The outer layer runs large up top; also, the orange stitching (the flowers) on the outer layer are extremely bright orange rather then a fall brownish orange that would match the layer underneath. i'm returning it because for the price i don't love it."
"I loved this t-shirt in the gray motif so much, went back to get the yellow:-) both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos. while the fabric is a little thin, it's super soft and just the perfect length."
"Really cute top(especially the back)!  i've tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one.  the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style.  runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric.  regular length works fine on my petite frame as well.  the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it.  first one i received had a snag/hole in the lower sleeve, so hopefully it holds up."
I bought the 0p and love this skirt! it works well dressed up for a night out or i even wore it to my nieces baptism...have received a ton of compliments each time i've worn it.
Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!
"This is a beautiful looking dress, but definitely runs wide and long. i'm 5'4, 112llbs and my normal xs swallowed me up. if it had been available in xs petite then that probably would have worked, even though i normally never go with petites. it is a gorgeous dress, and would probably work on those ladies who are taller."
"I love this top!! very comfortable and versatile!!
i will be purchasing the top in all the other colors!!"
"Light weight jacket, perfect layering piece . short enough to be the right accessory over a dress or skirt without getting a sloppy look. versatile, - also great over a long tee with skinny jeans. well made, fold cuffs back for the classic look."
This jacket is a great buy at the sale price. drape is wonderful and the weight is nice; lightweight and will transition well from summer to fall. the adjustable ties at the waist make it very flattering on a curvy figure. i purchased the white and am going to purchase the black as well. definitely recommend.
These shorts are so cute and comfortable! you can wear any color top and they are very flattering! they fit tts.
"This tank (in black) is nice quality, most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well. it's just too short and too boxy for my figure (curvy/hips). would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted. since that doesn't describe me, it has to go back."
"I am a pretty consistent size 2 or 26. ordered these in my usual 26 and, yikes, right out of the package knew they''d be way to small. they have a lot of stretch in them so i was able to get them buttoned but they were wayyyy too small and looked awful. i returned them for a 27 which i am still waiting for. i'll update this review when they arrive. other than the size issue, they were just as pictured/expected."
"This dress is so fun and very comfy! the slip it comes with pulls the whole dress together! it has been great for warm fall days, but i can see it being warn with leggings and boots into the winter. i love the combination of blocked deep colors along side of pastels. i'm 5'5"" and the length is just right, not too short."
"Wasn't sure whether i would like the top from the online picture, but it is so much more flattering in person. can be worn as a casual piece with denim skinnys or dressed up with a pencil skirt."
I thought i might like the look of this oversized odette dress but after i tried it on i felt it was not a flattering style on me. the color was pretty and fabric was nice - just not a fit for me.
"I purchased the pink top and really like it. it will be a ""go-to"". the material is light but not skimpy, and it has a nice drape to it. the length is good for me (5'4"") and it fits tts."
"This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!"
"I wore this for the first time this weekend and loved it. it is long and lean but not baggy or tent like. i'm 6'0"" so i appreciate the length and fit. 
will get a lot of use out of this. good w/ skinny jeans and i can't seem to have enough black tops."
"I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt. not at all! i'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight. it is more fitted. if you are looking for something more comfy, don't buy. however, if you want more of a fitted blouse feel, then go for it."
I love this dress. very comfortable. soft? absolutely!
"I purchased these on sale. one thing to say, i had to return the first pai r (xs) as there was a missing section of stiching on the sema, creating a whole you can't really fix neatly. so i ordered a new pari. i usually like petite, but regular size was fine, they jsut end up being to the ankle (longer), not bunchy. i also ordered xxs peite to compare, but that was smaller on waist, almost not comfortable), and the laced-up part looked a little weird/overstretched. i have not used htem to work ou"
"Love, love this tunic. my size 4 fits perfectly with a little room, material is very soft and very comfortable. could be worn with leggings or with a belt as a dress...so many options. so worth it!!!"
"I recently purchased this dress in the yellow, which is not advertised online, but glad i saw at the store because the color is vibrant but not too loud and really compliments my olive skin. the dress ran a little on the larger side so i had to size down. also, you will have to either wear a strapless bra or go without because you cant hide bra straps as this is more of a halter look. i'm 5'9"" and the length was perfect for me, will be able to wear with heels or flats."
This dress is made very well and can be dressed up or down! it can be worn with open toe wedges in spring and summer and cute booties in the fall.
"Very comfortable and stylish. can wear with tights, as a dress, or over jeans. cute any way! the material is not super thick, but not too thin."
"I found the color to be a bit blah, and the sweater is chunky and is a tad too short for wear it lands. also, because of its ""chunkiness,"" it doesn't tuck in as nicely to a pair of jeans as it appears to on the model."
"I never would have given these pants a second look online, in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me, i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer"
Love this easy caftan short dress so soft easy and so stylish
"This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering, but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all, it's just a very good design. 
note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear, without being visible, into the sleeve when they are not being used. also, the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used, so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo)."
"Saw this online- my size out (xs/s p). online did have xs. checked store saw how great the dress looked at store, able to try on only one avail at store (m). ordered xs online. fits well with ada belt and cardigan. until straps altered will keep cardigan on.very comfortable and cute- lots of compliments worn to work"
"I had purchased other sanctuary black petite leggings in the store and found these on -line. they are very flattering and well-made. runs a little small, i am 5'0 and 97 lbs; small fit more loosely which i prefer so i can wear them to work. thanks retailer for carrying great petite selection!"
"If you are like i am and love coats that stand out......this is for you. there are many +++++++++'s first being the quality, embellishment like this coat has can easily go crafty and this coat does not, also the bead work and trim is sewn beautifully with no loose threads visible to me. it is hard to see the bead work but it pops just right, colors are wonderful and fit is tts. it also,looks great belted and much nicer in person....."
I love this dress. the colors are eye catching. if flows nicely.
I love the pattern and shape of this top. i can dress it up a bit with white pants and heels or dress it down with shorts and sandals. nice fabric and fit.
This skirt caught my eyes right away in the clearance section. i would have tried size 2 but it wasn't available. however size 4 fitted just fine. the print has bright summery feel to it. the lines on skirt are more carrot orange than it is to red. fabric is soft.
As in super comfortable and a joy to wear. i saw it online and then went to the store to try it on. the moment i put it on i knew it was for me. i missed out on getting it in the other color. i hope you get more in other colors!
Love love love these leggings and what an amazing price point!!!
"I had been looking for a one-piece that is fashionable yet practical. fabric is beautiful, fit is impeccable, no complaints on lack of support. i find if you tie it tight up top it's very practical. this was the perfect choice for me. i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and ordered the small."
"I agree with the other reviewers. i ordered 2 of these but had to return both because the zippers didn't work. when i returned them, the saleslady said many people had problems with them."
"I took a leap and ordered this top in both colors. my style is bohemian and flowy so i knew this fit the bill. i purposely bought these blouses because i read the reviews and being a 16/36h, i knew i needed then to run on the larger side. i love both colorways equally, but that said, the blue and yellow pattern runs a whole size smaller than the brown patterned blouse. the fit and fabric even feel different! the blue and yellow is thicker and less flowy and fits exactly to my body instead of bei"
"Had the same inconsistent sizing issue in coral as miss janeausten. i ordered 2 corals, one in s & one in xs & the s was very much smaller than the xs as i could barely get my arms into the s (while my arms were loose in the xs). keeping the ""larger than s"" xs coral - the color is just lovely. also ordered the ivory in both ps & pm & keeping the pm as i like the longer arm length to cover my hands (for sun protection when i want/need). because you can cinch the waist tightly, a looser jacket sti"
"I love this sweater, it's so soft, and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it. it runs true to size, but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more, it seems to stretch a little. overall, i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it!"
I ordered a sp which is normally the size i wear from retailer i'm 5ft and 129lbs. and there is so much extra material on the bottom part of the dress. it would make a beautiful summer dress if it was at least 2inches narrower on the bottom. unfortunately they are out of the xsp which would be perfect. still contemplating whether to keep or return.
"I was so excited to order this beautiful coat.  it does seem well made and is very soft.  unfortunately, the fit is completely off and is overall large.  i ordered a small, as this coat appears slightly more snug on top, a-line on the bottom, with three buttons.  i am 5'6"" and weigh approximately 145.  i was expecting this coat to be body-skimming.  instead it was overall large and the bottom of the coat awkwardly flared.  the  pleat on the back is unflattering.  sadly going back."
I am so glad that i got this sweater.it is just perfect!
This blouse is very unique due to the pretty piped design on the back. looks great with jeans. the front is shorter and more tailored than the back. i love this blouse!
Love this top!! so comfy and flattering. i ordered the black and the blue and i am itching to get the red/purple one too!
"The fit and design are interesting. in the 00p, the fit was good though the dress was not easy to get into or out of - strategy required. the quality is fine. but the color was very ""blah,"" with too little of the bright stripes in an otherwise rather dull color scheme. that made the dress overall feel too busy and rather confused. with the lining and material weight, it would be more a cold weather item only, not an all seasonal dress.

generally, it was interesting but not a ""most come home wit"
"I ordered this dress in my usual size and unfortunately when it arrived, it was damaged and also a little too big. the fabric had lots of pulls in it like it had been tried on many times.

i called customer service and requested a replacement in a smaller size. it fit great and looked beautiful but there was a rip in the sleeve.

this is a gorgeous dress and very flattering and well fitting (if you size down), but i had to return both and wear something else to a holiday party.

i'd only recomme"
"I ordered this in a petite (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and size 4p fits perfectly) and it fits very well everywhere. however, i think if you're bigger than 34b, size up, because this top is very fitted around the bust. the bottom hem falls right below my belly button, the neckline is not too low and not too high. i chose black because i feel that there are a lot of details and can be toned down with a darker color. i think this top must be fitted for a tailored look, or otherwise one may risk t"
"Just got these jeans last week. love the quality, which is typical of pilcro jeans. i usually have to get a tall size, being 5'10"", however they sold out quickly. so i decided to order the regular inseam in my usual size. they fit great. since they are more of a boyfriend jean, they don't fit too snug. so i'm able to get away with the regular inseam. i'm usually a 26-27 tall, and the 27 regular works. love the cuffs and rise in the jeans. i've worn with booties, heels...and am waiting for warm w"
"I really want to love this dress, the style and colors are so nice and easy. i like the loose flowy feel of the dress. it runs a tad large, but that is part of the style. what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy, to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress. also, it has lining which is nice for modesty, but with the stiff/itchy factor mixed with lining, it feels a bit cumbersome. i haven't decided if i will k"
"You do not want to know how many cropped, wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right, apparently. these are great: comfy, make my legs look cute, not chopped off, they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the ""let out"" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.

i bought"
"I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1"" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater."
"This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact."
"Lovely sweater! it's a new staple in my wardrobe. love the fit and styling, but what drew me in at first sight were the colors. it's warm and cuddly."
"I wanted this dress in the turquoise motif, but it sold out so quickly! i tried on about 10 dresses in my local store and this was the clear winner. i got the blue and white motif, which has enough visual interest with the way the pattern flows across the dress. i found the dress to be slimming and very comfortable. you can throw it on and not think about flashing anything when you bend over, or the skirt flying up in the breeze, or needing a strapless bra. the skirt flows really nicely and over"
"Wanted a jumpsuit that didn't look stupid on a 50+ year old -- this is it! ordered a large and it is a little loose around the waist, but still fits and is comfortable. extremely well made and very cute. the only complaint is that it is difficult to tie the back."
"I really love the look and feel of this top, perhaps this was mentioned in previous reviews, but it is unlined, which i hadn't realized when i ordered it. so the eyelet details are will expose skin unless you wear a cami underneath."
I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides. be creative and wear it different ways.
"This is as pretty in person as it is online, good quality (except one item i'll get to), and fits true to size. i'm 5'6"", normally a medium/8, and the medium fit great in this top.
i almost kept this shirt...so close, i had it on a hanger, but i kept trying it on. the shirt is well displayed in the pics online, but unless you get close it's hard to see that the top button is set a little wide. every time i put it on, my eyes went to the top button (i did get a second opinion and they agreed)..."
"Great fit, easy to dress up or down, lovely shade of blue--this will be my default dress this summer."
These jeans look better in person - the pattern is more subtle than the picture online. these run true to size for ag denim.
"I am usually between a 8 and a 10 and was an 8 in this skirt, it is very nice because it has so many soft colors in it and will go with anything. i live in florida so for me this is a fall skirt! i like the look of a wrap and it is not a wrap it fits great."
"I love this top and wear it all the time. it's a gorgeous pale blue and feels amazing....it is a tighter fitting shirt so if you like looser clothes, size up"
"This top is so pretty but runs small. i have a 34 dd chest and small back and shoulders . the size 10 was too full cut on the bottom and the 8 was better on the bottom but fit the same on top, felt like the seams under the arms with either size would rip. truly an odd fit and cut. this brand tends to run small and narrow. better for a smaller chest ."
"Love this swimsuit. runs true to size. definitely recommend. very flattering. for reference i have a straight/athletic build, i'm 5'11"", 150, 34c, and size 8 was great for top and bottom."
I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it's stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip don't spill on it lol. my fault though so still 5 stars!
"I love this shirt, bought it at the store. i have a few shirts from this brand so i knew how it would fit. i love the colors in this short, it's very spring and light weight! love it very much!"
"If you look closely at the pattern it is a giant triangle running across the front of your body. this doesn't do great things really if you have more of an hourglass shape or small waist. it completely removed the idea that you have a small waist and draws attention to the area of the triangle that is the largest. also, i agree with another reviewer about being cautious about buttons, as several were off some of the dresses."
"I'm 5'4"", 120lbs and the xs fits perfectly. the skirt is flattering and quality is nice. will be good for cooler days in the fall. a bit warm for a hot summer day, but nice for a night time event."
Easy to wear.  the fabric is super soft and the shape is very flattering.   i really like the shirt hem at the bottom.
Wore this dress for my bridal shower and got a ton of compliments! it fits great and is very well made!
"I bought these in the ivory and love them so i decided to get the taupe. imagine my surprise when i got them and they were grey. if you hold up the pant that i received to the taupe shown online you can see how different the colors truly are, the grey color is nice, but i don't need another grey jean. i am disappointed that the taupe is so off as that's the color i really need. i would buy the ivory as it's true to color. not sure about the green. the jean itself is soft and fits perfect. i have"
Beautiful skirt but does run small. i wear a small and am able to keep the skirt but have to be very careful about under garments since it is so tight. looks great though.
"I had high hopes with the other good reviews, but you just don't know how amazing this is until you put it on! just so soft and cozy! i am so excited for more saturday/sunday products at retailer!"
"I'm not entirely sure if this shirt just runs large or if it fits oddly/boxy. the flowered material puffs out on the sides a couple of inches under my arms... i'm usually a pretty solid size medium, but i think i'm going to try to exchange this for a small to see if that solves that weird fit issue, because it is a nice idea of a design and comfortable overall. but, if that doesn't solve the trick, if not recommend, b/c that side puffiness isn't flattering."
"The dress is  very feminine and very flirty. i love orange/melon-colored dresses. this one does not disappoint. it does run extremely small around the rib cage. i had to size up to a 6 when i typically wear a 2 or 4. my bra size is 32 b. nice quality fabric, lined, with built-in bustier."
Give me a dress with pockets any day! i loved how i can wear this fall - spring. so cute. so comfortable. can dress it up or down. have 2 events that i'm going to wear it too!
"This dress is super soft, beautiful on, perfect fit!"
I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.
"I ordered the xxs petite (only size in petite left at the tme0 and that was right for me. i usually (should say used t) get xs but with the looser styles lately, xxs seems to fit me better. hte leg hem falls below my knee, but not too low on the calf. the waist is comfortable, hte weird part is the fabric, the sash part seems to be lighter and the softer part is on the inside so it would seem.

for reference, i am 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist."
"I was thoroughly underwhelmed. it did not hang well, and the fit seemed off. the tie waist just sort of hung there. i could have sized down, but i didn't even want to bother. it was pretty boring and flimsy for $138."
These chinos are the best.  the fit is always true to size. the quality is great and the new fall colors are beautiful. my favorite are the plum. these are my go-to pants
"Love the asymmetrical zipper, style, fabric and color. so soft, comfy and warm. i got a size small and it fits perfectly and isn't tight or loose. the pockets are sewn shut but easily opened by cutting the thread with scissors. highly recommend this cute and functional jacket!"
"I don't usually have the best luck with pants from retailer but something made me try these on. i am so glad i did! i love the fit and the fabric, they are so soft and comfortable.. i loved them so much that i bought an additional pair of the grey wanted the turquoise but they were sold out of my size so i settled on the sand... i will definitely try other styles of the pilcro."
"Got them in the light blue. i'm 5'0"" so they're a little long. i like the texture and they are really comfortable! the only thing is the awkward seams around the crotch area so you really can't wear them alone with a cropped tee or shorter top."
"These pants are amazing! i love that they zip in the back and the material is just right. i am 5'7"" and they are the perfect length. i bought the black and now buying the gray. i hope they come out with more colors!!!"
"This dress is beautiful. i love the collar and tie neck detail. i decided to order up a size and am very glad i did (i normally wear a 0 or 2 petite and ordered this in a 4 petite). it fits perfect with a little room...not snug at all, which i like. the description says its a slimmer fit so i'm happy i ordered the size i did. i'm excited to wear it and add it to my wardrobe."
"I was planning on wearing this at the office but it looks like a maternity blouse. not flattering at all. i loved the concept.. silky, loose fitting, professional.. but they didn't succeed. its a big mess. return."
"This dress is gorgeous in person and so comfortable. i wore this to a business meeting and got several compliments on it. i am 5 feet tall and it does run a little long on me, a petite small hits me slightly below the knee. however, the dress is so nice that i am keeping it."
"The girls at the local retailer are big fans of coh, & i've been thinking maybe i shld try them out. i ordered these online in the size 29, as i am usually a 28/29 in skinnys. i am a little hard to please, or say hard to fit in skinny jeans. i like a snug good looking skinny but not so much if it's uncomfortable. paying full price it is expected for the look & fit to be perfect. even if on sale, i won't go it if i think something is not right for me. at 5'3"", 117#, slender legs, skinnys are either"
"I've been anticipating the arrival of these pants and was literally at the doorstep with ups. i have a birthday celebration visiting wineries and thought this would be the perfect outfit.it did not disappoint. fits like a glove....very flattering and comfy! i am 5""4 and ordered a small petite. not too short, but still have the option of wearing sandals. i hesitated because of the price - but so worth it!!"
"Good weight and texture to the dress but looked to tent-like for me. even taking it out of the package my first thought was, is this size mislabeled? i got a 0 but could probably have done better with 00 if those were in stock or if petite sizes were still available. returning but wish i could keep it"
This jacket is adorable.. it is very flattering and different. can easily be dressed up for work or dressed down as shown. note: it is unlined and very light weight. these are huge selling points for me as it makes the jacket seasonless. love it!!!
"I was attracted to the colors when i first saw it...then i saw the back of it! the largest sz in the store was an 8.i had to order it, and got a sz 10. i then returned it for a 12 in order for it to drape properly in front. shorter than i usually wear, but worn with a higher waist bottom it fits nicely. and that back! not only is is striking, i am able to wear my regular bra under it, and the straps don't hang out."
"I loved this dress when i saw it in the store. the colors, weight, fabric. love. love. love. 
unfortunately i have to agree with other reviewers, the pockets and the positing of the draw string made my hips look unflatteringly large. i tried on a size 0 petite, which is my usual size. all flowed nicely except for when you get to the pockets. truly disappointed as it was beautiful in every other way. but in the end, i had to pass."
"I am a shorter woman (5'3"") and typically a size large. i purchased this dress in a large. it is flattering and fits well. good length as well."
"Love the wine colored cords-- but i tried them and i was disappointed because my normal size was too small. i usually have to size down in pilcro pants but not these. (i'm an 8, and the 30 wasn't going to button!) i love the slight cropped flare! and the color! did i mention the color? but vanity wouldn't allow me to buy them. hopefully i just got a mislabeled pair!"
"I love designs that are flowy/drapey in the front, so this hits the mark when tied in the back. has lots of visual interest. but i agree with the other reviewers.. the slip is super small. dress fits true to size, if not a bit large but the slip is one full size smaller. and you must wear a slip. overall, i'm pleased with the look."
"Almost perfect! this jacket doesn't have that weird vegan smell. it's soft, smooth, and very high quality. this jacket is also a nice surprise for us busty ladies. i'm a 32ddd and the m fit nicely, no squishing (as the other reviewers have said, the chest has room!). 

i got the gray, and i loved it it's soft tint. i returned it because the lower band of the jacket sits right at my widest part of my torso, my post-baby belly. the jacket is sort of short like a peplum, and i want to hide the st"
"Purchased it in raspberry. first time it came in the mail, it was stained and the hem looked like it had been dragged through the mud! come on customer service, you need to be more diligent about checking out items before you ship them! i ordered it again, and this time it was a new jumpsuit in plastic, so pristine. 
i am a size 8-10, and the small fit me fine. the lining is a little tight in the crotch area, but i can put up with it for the style of this jumpsuit!!"
"I don't have anything like these pants so was thrilled to purchase the coral. i found the pants ran slightly large, though i stuck with my regular 28"" and they are very comfortable."
"Great dress! needs a tank top underneath, but has a great shop."
"I ordered the xx petite on this one, and unlike last year's version of a similar sweater, this one is a bit longer and looser. last year, i kept the xs p, but it was shorter too. the fit is loose, not snug or form-fitting, even as the smallest size available, it was loose but not large or unflattering. the length was also appropriate. love the colors, and pattern too. the material is soft, and the button detail in the back is fun. i am 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs, for reference."
"Gorgeous top/tunic. runs true to size. i paired it with jeans, but i love the look of the white pants in the picture. beautiful and flows nicely."
This top has great lines and has a very flattering fit.
I have featured two pictures below. one is size s. the other is xs petite. i'm 5 feet 120 and a 34 d. i highly recommend this dress. i definitely could have gone either way. but felt sizing down would be more flattering.
"This is simply the most lovely, interesting, flattering sweater ever. i got the green which is a lovely minty color. couldn't be happier!"
This is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big.
"I was very happy to receive this as a birthday gift. i usually wear an xs or s in clothes i buy from retailer. i was given this in a s, but it wasn't even close to meeting in the front, so i returned it for a m. it doesn't button anyway, but i didn't want it to look like it wouldn't meet at all. i tried on a size s sweater in this brand while i was in the store, and it fit perfectly, so this one is just running small. overall, i love the lace detail on the front and the softness of the sweater."
"I practically live in lounge pants, and i like the unique style of this wide-leg version. i'm generally a 6/28 in pants and ordered the small which fit well, if a bit big. the overall fit is great - slim at the hip with a nice wide waistband, and flatteringly-placed dropped pockets. the pants really slim my hips and provide a nice silhouette with the wide legs. the fabric is soft and flows and i did not experience any sheerness. as for color - i would call these a deep cool brown, definitely not"
Just received this dress and i am in love! the colors are beautiful- perfect for both summer and fall. the fabric is very soft and the fringe detail adds a nice feminine touch. i was disappointed when i missed out on the first fringe stripe shift dress from holding horses at the beginning of this summer. it was completely sold out in my size 0. however when i saw they restocked the dress in a new color (and now lined yay!) i had to buy it. would defin recommend!!
"Beautiful and very versatile dress. extremely forgiving for post baby bodies, while stylish and classy."
"I was so in love with this dress when i saw it in the store but so disappointed when i put it on. i am 5'10"" with curves and usually buy a large in dresses. this dress looked like a sack on me. the top was way too big and loose making the dress a boxy cut rather than a maxi cut like i was expecting. the dress is lovely to look at on the hanger and feels good on but i don't think it flatters hourglass figures. it was the right length for me unlike many other reviewers. 
obviously, based off the"
I love this sweater especially the color. i never would have order this sweater on line but when i saw it in person the color was more of a burnt orange. the fit was perfect. i can wear with skinny jeans or leggings.
"Love the color, fit and feel of these jeans.  the thin material is stretchy and comfortable. i didn't have to pull them up every so often during a 3 hour party.  they didn't bag out after the first wearing and are true to size.  i got a 27p (5'2"", 115#).  the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle.  the rise wasn't too low for me.  highly recommend!"
"I have been lusting after this dress and though tit would be great for thanksgiving. the fit for me, however, is totally wrong. for reference, i'm 32dd, 5'8"", 140 lbs, and am a s or 4. the small fit well in the body area but felt a little small in my upper arms. the arm length was more of a 3/4 sleeve on me which looked terrible because the sleeves are baggy. the quality felt like it was lacking, too. the material felt like it would pill easily. order with caution."
So flattering on my curvy (and busty) body.  so many swing style tops have too much fabric and make you look larger than you actually are.  not the case with this top - the fabric and cut make the bottom half flow beautifully; so flattering imo.  i usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue and went with the small.  the shoulders and arms fit my small bone structure perfectly; the burn out pattern and color are gorgeous.   can?t wait to wear!
"I first saw this tees paired with a skirt (blue and white stripes on the website). i immediately like the unique shape around the shoulder, v-neck line with a gap to the sleeves. even the color is white, it looks very appealing to me, simple yet unique. i bought the tees in white and black colors. i expected the white one to be sheer, but not the black one. even with a nude bra, i can slightly see the bra shape inside the tees. the size is running large. i usually wear size s with retailer. i got"
Love the leggings. very soft and comfortable. i ordered two pair -one s/m and one m/l. the s/m fit better on me but both will work.
I just received this dress tried it on. i totally fell in love with it . the pink is just beautiful.it's a little big so i will definitely will be exchanging it for a size 14 . you would absolutely love this dress.
"Gorgeous color and fit, but fabric is not great. i ordered this to wear with leggings and booties. i returned as i could tell it would get baggy in the elbows and rear end. just not a good fabric. bummer!!!!"
"This is a soft, comfortable and flattering alternative to a regular t-shirt - not dressy, but a little more put together looking. it also doesn't wrinkle, so it's my go-to travel shirt for warmer months."
"After seeing the picture online, i was coveting this top for a while and then retailer days happened! i immediately ordered it, but i'm still not sure if i'm going to keep it. i ordered a 2p (0p was sold out) and i was assuming it was going to be a little big, but i like flowy. the sleeves and chest are perfect but the top is cut so generously in the back (and it's a bit longer in the back as well) i feel like it looks like i'm wearing a wedding dress. i love it from the front. i'm going to try to"
"I recently purchased the reading room cardigan in the color pink. the color is beautiful, and very flattering with my olive complexion. i ordered a medium, and although it's not a traditional fitted cardigan, the shape was very flattering, good length for my 5' 6"" height, and is very versatile. great for transitional weather into spring."
"I found this dress on a pretty good sale. i'd never pay full price. that said, it's very stylish. it reminds me of marni, mui mui or prada. as other posters have mentioned, it does run tight across the bust"
The skirt is so cute but it runs pretty small.  the fabric is nice and heavy it is adorable with a chambray top.
"I read the reviews before i bought this dress and had trouble believing that the dress literally fell apart at the seams so i bought it. first the good: i love the color, the fabric, and the design. it's very lightweight and loose-fitting and is perfect for hot days. the neck and sleeves are pretty on. i can wear it as a cover up or put on a necklace and sandals for everyday errands and things.
now the bad: it literally falls apart at the seams as you take it out of the package! i""m surprised a"
"I am 5'8"", broad shoulders,can sometimes wear a size 4 depending on the cut. i purchased the size 6 and was a true fit. just enough flow to give you room to move but not too much to make you look larger than you really are. the fabric us light and great quality. perfect for a summer night out. so happy with this purchase"
"Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin, easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!"
"This dress is so light and twirly and the fabric is as airy as it is pretty. sadly the fit was a bit off. i am 5'7"", 128. i tried on my usual sz 2 and found the top to be saggy at the armpits but too tight at the waist seam; going up to a 4 only made for a saggier top. most likely a great dress for lean or long-torsoed ladies, which sadly i'm not!"
"I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute)."
I wanted to love this dress. i bought the cranberry color and it really is gorgeous. the cut was wrong for my body type. it is a bit roomier than expected. but i wear a size 36ddd so the seams on the chest hit at a very awkward spot. i'm sure it would look great on someone with a smaller chest
"I wasn't going to even try to see it this dress would fit.  it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model.  i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it!  my outfit is a floppy straw hat, skinny leather belt and flat sandals.  there's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out.  i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#."
"My favorite of the season. i purchased the grey sweater while shopping with girlfriends. i love it so much i'll be purchasing the brown as well. i would normally wear a m/l but tried it on and purchased a s. i don't like very fitted items. however, a small fit perfectly on me. this item runs big."
"I am 5'2"", 120lbs. and bought the 4 petite, which is what i normally wear, and it fits perfectly. the quality of the fabric and stitching is good, not great, and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment, but for me, the style, the fit and the fact that it doesn't seem to show wrinkles, at least not before washing, turned it in to a keeper for me. the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it. i tried the ada belt with it, but found i"
"This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless, top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money."
"I ordered a small and it is enormous; i usually wear a size 10. it is short but the fullness in the body and the sleeves made me look like a sumo wrestler. also, it is a very heavy knit which would be great for up north but too bulky for atlanta unless the temps are in the 40s. i'm sending it back."
"I saw this shirt online first and immediately knew i wanted to purchase at least two colors. i went to my local store for the mother's day sale and tried it on in the black/white and the coral/navy. i purchased both colors. i actually wanted to get all three but had some other items i prioritized over the teal/white. it fits great and is super comfortable. i have been wearing the black and white all day today and sadly, it is already pilling and doesn't seem to be holding up very well (photo giv"
"Thought i would love this product, but i had to return it. the fabric and design were very nice but the length was very short and the neck too tight. i ordered a xxsp which is usually the size i get. if i had known i would have ordered a regular xxs. not sure if this would have solved the problem. might be worth going to the store to try."
"Fits great. structured, but still comfy. figure flattering."
"I ordered this dress in the green ,and i love it. it does run a little large so i went down one size, which was ok by me!! it is super cute!!"
"I purchased this top in a size s. it is lovely but way too wide. i am 5'8"" and 140 lbs. so it's unusual for me to have to size down to an xs. i am going to see if sizing down helps, but i am worried it will still be too wide. the fabric seemed of high quality and i loved the faded color so i am going to give it another chance."
"If you like a slightly heavier, non/clingy basic tee, this is it. i wore the long sleeved version all fall and winter, rotating colors, and i've been wearing these with shorts and leggings since i got them. the colors are great, fabric is quality, and the ribbon detail in the back gives these a little flare."
"Loved pattern,  quality and fine details on this dress but  it ran large. i ordered petite small and it was way too loose/baggy .i had to return it.  i went bsck to order a petite x/small, but it was no longer available in this size on- line. so disappointed! 

fyi ,  i'm 5' , 112-115lbs and small boned -always wear size petite small . but not fir this dress! 

this dress is comfortable , well made, lined and pattern is extremely pretty with nice border ( which is hard to find for petites -a"
The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt.
"Great, rather heavyweight, long cardi. i purchased the blue, which is a lovely shade of gray/blue, not quite as bright as the picture depicts. pin is adorable; doubt i'll ever use it to close the sweater, but still a nice touch. for reference i'm 5'5"", 136 lbs, 34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium. took a medium in this one and glad i did. perfect fit. falls exactly like on the model."
"This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.

the doubled-up buttons makes the blouse unique and it's comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall."
"I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper, this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee, so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath."
So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.
This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i'm usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i'm wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it.
"This will be my go-to shirt for fall! its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleeve...the neckline is unique & the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest. fit is slim, nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering. i will likely purchase more colors once on sale! i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected. my only drawback is how thin the material is - i can see it getting snags or holes easily, but i will deal"
I would highly recommend this top. it is beautiful and it helps to hide problem areas. much prettier than the picture depicts. i am very happy with this purchase. can't wait to wear with black or white capris this summer.
"I was looking for an off-the-shoulder top and chose this one. it is pretty. the bottom of the shirt is fairly billowy, so i can only wear with skinny pants. takes a little getting use, somewhat restricting my arm movement so the shirt pops off my upper arms."
"Love this top! the colors are so fun and happy, and the fabric/fit are soft and breezy. it is definitely on the boxy side, but not in an unflattering way (in my opinion). super cute in my usual size small."
"I wanted to love this top, but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the ""grey"" that you order is much, much lighter grey. in addition, this shirt is super boxy... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in. going back disappointed."
"Good design, comfortable fit. however, sizing is way off. i am a 34c and the small fits with minimal support. agree with the previous review. not sure it is a keeper."
Love this sweater but it's too large. will exchange for smaller size because i really want it.
"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt, if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff, felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect, the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size."
Beautiful nightie- looks like its really well made and fits really well. i'm normally a size 6-8 and the m was perfect. definitely recommend.
"I think i ordered this in an xxs because of the other reviews making it sound like it ran large. and i'm happy with the size and overall look of this tee on me. i'm 5'3"" about 105 lbs and 34aa (i generally order xs or xspetite). the cuffs of the sleeves are pretty tight and the v-neck is higher than i'd like but otherwise i really like the loose, casual fit. there's no armhole seam, they're dolman sleeves. the tee i got translates to ""the beautiful coast"". it does say made in usa on the label. a"
"This was not what i was expecting. at all. i am a medium in just about everything but ordered a large to possibly wear this as a dress instead of a tunic since i am around 5' 4"". the large fit like a small on me, and not like a typical oversized sweater type small, but a normal fitted top small. a previous reviewer said it is long and straight, and i think that is a good description for it. i think the models wearing this in the pictures are all wearing an extra-large #or a different cut of the"
The medium fits perfectly. it's not too long or too short. the feel of the fabric is soft and not heavy at all. i love the detail in the bird too. it bright and colorful. overall a great buy!
"I just think this dress is so cute! i love it with booties! 
here are the fit details: i'm 5'4 1/2"" and the front of the dress hits just above my knees. (i was concerned that it would be too short for my lifestyle based on the photo). the sleeves roll up and have a tab to button, however the button is very low. therefore, the sleeve rolls up not mid arm, but actually about three inches above my wrist! (it's still super cute, just nowhere near my elbow. just letting you know).
final detail that"
"These have a very interesting cut. it seems like they were made for someone extremely tall. i'm about 5'5"" and the size 4 fit in the waist, but fell way below where they do on the model on the picture. it's hard to imagine who they would look good on, they're also very poofy right below the waist."
"Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though."
"So i was super excited to get this skirt, unfortunately it's not what i thought it would be. the color is much different then what pictured, it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life. the material isn't so great easier, i thought it would be thicker but instead it's pretty thin and wrinkles easy. the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating. i wouldn't say it's itchy like the other re"
This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.
"I bought this tank on a whim without trying it on in the store, in black. the detail on the front is cute and the peplum is really cute without being frumpy at all. i am usually a small, ocassionally a medium in retailer shirts and i bought this in small. it fits but i feel like i could have gone up to a medium, it's just a little tight across the chest, but i do have more broad shoulders than most so maybe it's just because of that. the fabric is nice and stretchy, so i might be able to get away"
"If you have a love for vintage, romantic, feminine attire, this is the dress for you. it evokes memory of days gone by. it isn't just beautiful, the quality is superb. make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it."
"Love this blouse. per the previous review, there was no problem with my tailoring. it is exactly as shown. i plan to handwash this and take super good care of it. you can tell from the picture it could be an excellent wardrobe staple and absolutely timeless as well as the kind of sexy and elegant you can get away with in the office.

i do think it runs a tiny bit small. however, it is not short. it's just quite a fitted piece. i would consider sizing up. i love the look of the medium on me, 5'10"
"Great top! i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s. i ordered the white to start with and decided to go back for the other 2 colors. it's a great basic to wear with pants/shorts/skirts, but the side slit and slant set it apart from a regular tank. i opted for the small in this top just because of where the side slit hit."
"I wanted to love this top. i wanted to love it so badly i bought it twice. the design and beading are beautiful, but the sizing is off. as another person mentioned it does run short, but that was not the issue for me. i ordered my usual size in this brand and the arm holes were too tight. because i really love it, i decided to exchange it for a larger size. i did not try it on in the store because i never wear that size, and just assumed the arm holes would be larger. sadly they were not. still"
"I am 5'0"" tall and i have decent legs. these shorts are pretty short! i am sending them back for a small to see if they'll give a little more coverage. i should mention that they are absolutely darling and i bought the top that is shown with them. it's going to be a great little summer outfit. the quality of this brand is always very good."
"I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38"" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way, especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous, especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry"
"These looked so fun, i had to have them! i usually wear a 14 in pants, but the large fit well. despite a lack of thigh gap and walking in these all night, i didn't lose a single sequin. they're comfortable and get a ton of compliments. if you're considering them, i definitely recommend going for it!"
"Joggers are my new style this spring/summer i think. i love the simplicity of this style. the cut is perfect, very true to size. i like the longer length - perfect to wear with kitten heels, flats, or slip on canvas. this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit."
"This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.

*highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out."
"I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral. unfortunately, the shape is ""a"" line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering. so, it will be returned."
This romper is adorable!!! i love the long sleeves!
"Wanted to get this sweater in the red but the size has been sold out for a long time, then saw the navy go on sale and snatched it up. great fit, cropped shorter than most sweaters very classic looking and perfect for layering into the fall."
"I love this shirt, it's easy to belt. i just wish it was tighter."
"Cute, comfortable, easy to wear, even on my hourglass figure. can't decide the best shoes to wear with this - so it doesn't look frumpy."
Great sweater for any occasion. may be dressed up and/or worn with jeans. very versatile. love that it is short sleeves. size is true to fit.
"I really wanted to love this shirt. it looked so nice and cool for summer and i don't own anything purple. the color was really nice, very subtly feminine. i am a little too short for this style though. i am 5 ft. 1 inch, 105 lbs ordered an xxs and it was still too wide. the side slits came up a little too high for my liking, but i easily could've stitched those up a bit and they'd have been fine. i think this would look great on taller women, but on me it looked like a dumpy sack."
