"Love this dress!  it's sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i'm glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it's petite.  i bought a petite and am 5'8"".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite.",5
"I love, love, love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and fabulous! every time i wear it, i get nothing but great compliments!",5
This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie. it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan. love this shirt!!!,5
"I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person. (store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops.",5
I love this dress. i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size. very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style.,5
"I'm 5""5' and 125 lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn't too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you're less busty (34b cup or smaller), a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug, but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party, or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath.",5
This dress is perfection! so pretty and flattering.,5
"More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid",5
"Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn't bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).
my stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it's running big.
the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.
i'm 5'6"" and it came to just below my knees.",5
Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn't crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can't go wrong.,5
"A flattering, super cozy coat.  will work well for cold, dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit.  i am 5' 5'', about 135 and the small fits great.",5
"I love the look and feel of this tulle dress. i was looking for something different, but not over the top for new year's eve. i'm small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look. once i steamed the tulle, it was perfect! i ordered an xsp. length was perfect too.",5
"I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn't sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven't had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it's great for any occasion and it's fun to wear!",5
I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don't hesitate. buy this shirt. you won't be sorry.....,5
"This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it's warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat.",5
Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop. so much cuter in person. love these!,5
"I never would have given these pants a second look online, in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me, i am 5'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer",5
These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned.,5
"This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!!",5
"Just ordered this in a small for me (5'6"", 135, size 4) and medium for my mom (5'3"", 130, size 8) and it is gorgeous - beautifully draped, all the weight/warmth i'll need for houston fall and winter, looks polished snapped or unsnapped. age-appropriate for both my mom (60's) and myself (30's). will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings. we ordered the gray which is true to the photos.",5
Super cute and comfy pull over. sizing is accurate. material has a little bit of stretch.,5
Great casual top with flare. looks cute with grey pilcro stet jeans. flattering with peplum in back. nice cut for shoulders and neckline.,5
"This is a beautiful top. it's unique and not so ordinary. i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest. although i had a baby this year and i am nursing, so that could be why. if i bought again i would size up.",5
"This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design, the colors look like sorbet & cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels. i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring. great buy!!",5
"Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it's too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can't see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5'8"""" and i generally wear a 6, the small fit well. will probably be back for the black!",5
I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i'd still recommend it as it is so comfortable.,5
"Very comfortable, material is good, cut out on sleeves flattering",5
"This sweater is perfect for fall...it's roomy, warm, super comfy and the color really pops.",5
"Really cute top! the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique, received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it. i'm rather busty up top and the medium fit well, a small probably would've fit better but it's still super adorable.",5
"I absolutely love this bib tee! it's probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me. i typically wear either a s or m tops.",5
"Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can't see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i've found that it means wardrobe malfun",5
This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i don't usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit.,5
"This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can't wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i'm tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail.",5
"3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!",1
I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i'm so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering.,5
"Very comfortable shirt, light weight top with lovely floral colors. great for spring/summer with white jeans. love everything one september makes!",5
Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale!,5
"Love this top! i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size, since my post-baby body is a little wonky. i went with the xsp, and miraculously, it works perfectly! so, i would say it does run just a little large..... i love the length, and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular. but this is perfect on me, and there is give up top, so it looks lovely. and it is very soft and comfortable. this will be a go-to top this season!",5
"I have a short torso and this works well for me. 34c, bought the 0. there's not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest, but not in an uncomfortable way. definitely doesn't hang and have extra fabric like on the model. 

zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it's easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric.

unlike another reviewer, i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer. wi",5
I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear,5
"I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store. i am petite and only 5'2"", so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute. there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on, but i think it is still super cute and flattering. i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type. i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs",5
I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms.,5
"I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i'm 5'1"" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.

this dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store, salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.

i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte",5
Loved this top. great design. comfortable and unique. soft material,5
"The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured. i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket. the print is great, i love it! it's so different than any other jackets ive seen. while the jacket is ã¼ber cute, it is a bit bulky (though the waist tie helps with that) and its not heavy winter appropriate ( it's not waterproof or heavily insulated). for your average winter day though, it will be a fun option! the removable v",5
"I purchased this top in an antro store last week. the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique. the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders, but can be removed by snaps. i tooks great when worn two different ways. i wore it with the campole out, and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom. it also looks great when the camisole is worn in. my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it's a touch big at the shoulders and neckli",5
"I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5'8"" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it's thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors",1
"This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely, and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side, but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all, but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size, but otherwise i would order your normal size.",5
"Purchased this top online, and when i received it was very pleased.
it has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric.
love that the sleeves run longer......ads to the overall look.
also loved the v neckline.........enhances the feel of the overall style.
with various necklaces this top has limitless options!
the color states moss....which i usually think of as greenish brown......i found it to be more of a taupe.
would have liked it to have a green tones, however it is still a fantastic f",5
"I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok, but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops, but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said ""that's a piece of tablecloth."" it's going back.",1
"I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute, but it was huge, shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should've looked at other reviews.",1
This top is absolutely stunning. i purchased the white one. just received and it fits nicely-a little on the big side but i believe it looks better that way. this will look great with everything. it is well constructed and looks very unique. love it!,5
"I bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the &quot;sky&quot; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue, which disappointed me. it is definitely darker than appears in photo. still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal. it drapes like a snake slithering down your body. it comes with attitude.",5
"The shirt is exactly as it is pictured, i have the burnt orange color and love it! i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt. it fits true to size, as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders. i would give this top a 5/5.",5
"Perfect dress for hot, humid, sticky weather.",5
This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster.,1
"I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small. i have to totally disagree with the reviewer! i find that this top runs true to size or even generous! the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual! i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit (5""2"", broad shoulders, 120 lb)",5
"This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time. it runs true to size. i'm 5'1"" 113 lbs and got the xs petite. wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it!",5
"This is the perfect summer dress. it can be dressed up or down. the quality of the linen fabric is very nice. i'm 5'1"" and it hit right below my knees. i found it to run true to size. those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size, but the tie in the front can be adjusted. it's lovely.",5
"The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus, and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.
the fit is true to size and the 'stressed' velvet fabric is current for this season.
i'm going to enjoy wearing this shirt.",5
"The perfect striped t-shirt, and the cute little buttons down the front are a wonderful accent with each one being different. i love it!",5
Great look and you can wear this vest with almost everything . i normally wear a small but they only had mediums and it fit fine( i like it tied). this will stay in my closet all year round . it does look like it will wrinkle easily but that doesn't bother me . a must buy !,5
"This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work, to a bbq, or to happy hour. i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely. the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model.",5
"After reading the previous reviews, i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5'4""/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can't wait to wear it!",5
"This coat is beautiful! i love the color and the design. it definitely runs a little large. i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem. i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already. the vest keeps it warm, but the sleeves aren't lined so it's cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if you're going to be in cold weather.",5
This top is super comfy and casual. the slit/design in the front gives it more of a stylish look than your average white long sleeve tee. would definitely recommend.,5
"I love this vest! there are so many ways to style it...open or tied closed, over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans. i get compliments every time i wear it. it's soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavy/hot to wear all day.",5
"This blouse is a perfect creation: perfect-weight cotton, many, many details, and color, all perfectly executed. there's fullness to the body, so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot, humid locations this summer, and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look. there's no mistaking quality when you look at this piece! i bought the medium for my 130#, 34f, size 8 blouse/tee frame. this is the blouse you will have for years, and you will enjoy",5
"The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering, classic and comfortable! the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile - could be worn year-round (so long as it's not 100 degrees out - there is a bit of weight to it). it's one of my favorite pieces in my closet. can be styled 20 different ways. pair with a higher-end tee, tank, denim jacket or body-hugging sweater. i sized down.",5
"Perfect for work or going out. i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate. it did not feel scratchy to me, maybe because i layered it. great buy especially with the discounts. feel like i lucked out.",5
Ii'm not usually big on lace but this is so unique and versatile that i went for it. looks good dressed up w/a nice top or casual w/a tee. can be worn practically all year. love it!,5
"Some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side, but for me, it was big,,, too bad the smaller size is sold out (well, all peittes are sold out). the length is also pretty long, below the knee, but in the narrow part still...so able to keep it. the colors are great. i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists, adn they all loved it and told me to keep it... winner for sure!",5
I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas. i fell in love since i saw it. the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this spring/summer !! and it has pockets on the sides! don't we love pockets? very practical and lightweight,5
"This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me, slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i'm 5'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well, especially in the waist but didn't want it too big in the hips. length was perfect, to my knees.",5
"This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal, but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up, dressed down, worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too ""out-there"" (unless you want it to be, of course!). the fit is true to size, and the delicate details are just lovely.",5
"Like other reviewers noted, the pics don't do this skirt justice. it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors. can't wait to wear this to work!",5
This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments.,5
"This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact.",5
"The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.

the stiff fabric of the bo",1
The online picture does not do this skirt justice. it's very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt.,5
"I bought a petite, size 2. i am 5'3"", 111 lb - it fit perfect with a tiny bit of room. looks just like the one pictured. length on me was about 1 inch lower than the model. very bright with multiple colors. has a nice stretch. very cute.",5
This will be perfect for the mild fall weather in texas. it's light weight and i love that the top is a little more fitted and the bottom swings out.,5
"I love the dresses by maeve and this one is no exception. i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this dress because i wasn't sure about the print size and colors when i saw it online, but the print is beautiful. it's a very simple but elegant style and the ruffle on the back adds an extra touch of interest. i like that it has enough coverage at the top (front and back), the underarms do not fall very low, and it is lined. the a-line skirt will flatter most body types. the fabric and overall q",5
These pants are fun! i use them as sleep pants. i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort.,5
"I ordered this in xs, i'm 5'4"", around 115lbs, and it fits perfectly. the material is very soft, but not see-through, and the romper is well-made. i wish it came in other colours, i'd buy more!",5
"This skirt is beautiful (especially the color) and looks well made. however, i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me. i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasn't flattering. i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this.",5
"Love the fit of this sweater! it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model. it hits me just below the hips( for ref. im 5-3""). im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable. could be dressed up or down. runs true to size-im always a small and this fits perfectly roomy.",5
"I love this sweater!! i like sweaters that are narrow on top and taper out so it doesn't look like a sack on me. plus, it is the perfect weight. i wish i would have bought one in a different color because it is so comfortable.",5
"Love this tunic! i am a curvy gal (with a few extra 'curves' in the middle) and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative. i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy- pink, a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture. i found it true to size. typically i wear a medium or large, depending on the structure and the medium fit well. a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist. i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas, it is",5
"Loved the green color, the cut is super flattering, but alas, i do need hte petite, ti was a bit long and i looked a little lost. unfrotuantely, the color is sold out in petite :-(",5
"I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. i'm 5'7"" size 10-12 and the large fit just right.",5
This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress.,5
"I love the color of this skirt, and the fabric is wonderful. it was a bit longer than anticipated, but fit well.",5
"Finally a ""swing top"" that doesn't look like a sack on me! i've been wanting to partake of this current style, but everything i've tried so far just looks ""dumpy"" on me. not this top -- it is very feminine and flattering. i am 5'7"" 118 lbs and have a small waist -- and although this is a ""swing"" style, it still shows my waist and doesn't overpower me. it is also a lovely fabric -- especially in the soft pink which i got. i'm thinking of going back for more colors!",5
"I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it. so many people compliment it. i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up (obviously with a statement necklace too). but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down. the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink (which i hope it doesn't because it is one of my favorite pieces). 

unlike the other reviewer i did not think that the",5
"Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it's suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5'8"", 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good.",5
"For a now feel, that comfy and well made, this was a great choice!",5
Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like i'm pregnant (not that there's anything wrong with that) very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf.,5
"Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges. i'm a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out. it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesn't make the wearer look big; it falls elegantly and in a flattering way.

great, versatile shirt.",5
"Gorgeous top, very nice. detail work, soft and flattering. i don't think its too full on the bottom at all - mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette. word of warning: soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink - and definitely not my color. if peach isn't flattering on you, heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly! i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade, bummer that i thought the other reviewers might",5
Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders.,1
"I have already worn this several times. it is very flattering, lightweight, and easy to wear. dressy but also very soft and comfortable.",5
"I'm 5'4"", 130 lbs. 34 d. i bought the medium. i think i could have gotten the small but i didn't have time to re-order. it fit fine but could have been a little more snug around my top half. i love the length and the fabric.!",5
"The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return.",1
"Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception.  looks just like the pictures (colors/cut/drape) with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep v-neck.  sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff.  this dress does not stretch--the bodice felt very fitted and tight, especially at the waist band.  runs tts or small; if you're busty/broad shouldered, size up.  it has a dreadful side zip, is fully lined and all synthetic fabric (boo!)  i purchased size 10p, my stats 36c/38-27-35/135#.",5
"Adorable... too chilly now to wear alone & too cute to cover it up! my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w/ it though. size 6 fits me perfectly & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love plaid & cotton blend tops anyways. ruffles - adorable, & i'm not too big on that but do love this look. when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd 'smoky'-like odor, but it's the dye i think. after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared. i have in mind to wear w/ the pilcr",5
"This dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess.  falls in the right area and absolutely adorable.  the dress is very fragile, handle with care.",5
This is my new favorite top! looks and fits as described.,5
Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too.,5
"This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style, with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won't have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it's warm without being bulky. and to top it off, it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least.",5
"I needed a dress that was easy to throw on for summer days and this dress is perfect for that. it's flattering, light weight and unique. i've received a handful of compliments while wearing this dress. i am 5' 6"" 150 lbs, hourglass figure and typically purchase a small or medium (8-10) and chose a small for this dress. i'd say it's still loose on me- which is what i prefer. the scoop neck and cut out allows you wear a normal bra. however, i've noticed i'm more comfortable wearing a camisole or s",5
"I love paige brand pants-they are soft, comfortable, and forgiving. i love these, and want them badly. the are still tight all the way to the knee and then go out into a flattering flare-it is difficult to find the perfect fit on something like this-and paige has done a wonderful job for my body.

my store does not carry petite so i tried these on in regular length. they were significantly too long for me (5'3"") probably 3-4 inches to long. i am hoping for a sale so i can buy them in petite for",5
"This top is really pretty and nice quality. runs big - i went down a size, and its perfect. coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo.",5
"I tried on the petite size in my usual xs, adn i actually have to go down to xxs, i looked overtaken by the shirt. i'm 5'2"" and 115lbs)

cut is flowy and not close to the body, sleeves are narrower, but still ok with athletic built.

color: light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair, but for my pale self, the darker one was better... but can't go wrong, i ordered both colors and liked both of them.

ruffle is a great addition too...",5
"I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino. great for hot days of summer.
the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg. overall a really flattering cut. the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top.",5
"These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i'm 5'5') to cuff at the ankle if i don't want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a",5
"I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller.
it runs very generous, and so the sizing is a little off.
the style and quality are beautiful, so i am anxious to receive the smaller size.",5
"The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.

very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there!",5
"I got a small mauve. the fit is great and the length is perfect for me, just few inches above my knees.
cute and cozy! what more can i aske for!?",5
"Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected, but that's the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up, it might be a little longer in the body, but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn't too thick, so it's a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it!",5
"I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric, and for a white/lightly striped dress, not sheer. i'm bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry, holes started appearing everywhere, both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest, in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget",1
"I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews, but i should have ordered my own size, as they're a bit loose around the waist. the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering, so i definitely recommend them!",5
"This is exactly what i was expecting. cute, comfortable and casual. there are some gold sequins in the scroll work that i didn't see online. they are super pretty in person.",5
I love these pants. i have worn them a number of times already this season. i am 5' so i did have to have them hemmed. i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still 3 or 4 on the pants so i don't think they look odd. i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps. a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks!,5
"I love this tunic the natural color is just that, this is a tunic so the fit is a little large. i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top",5
These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don't seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile.,5
"I have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite. great comfy, casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up. highly recommend for summer!",5
Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some.,5
"I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly, it fits me very well (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much, and it's not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it's brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way, the fabric is super soft (but not w",5
From the picture i wasn't sure how it would fit. got in the mail and i love it. fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it. definitely should of gotten a large.,5
"I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price, and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat. the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily. other than that, the silhouette of the coat is perfect...not too boxy! it's also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter. i love it!",5
This top is very cute. got it in the lighter color. the fit is great and it will go with many things. if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also.,5
"This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything!",5
"I ordered this dress in both colors. the peach color is so beautiful in person. i'm planning to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner at the end of the summer, if i can hold off until then! definitely worth the price.",5
"This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color, it's gorgeous in person, very bright, vibrant colors. i am 5'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out, and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads, if you're thinking about buying this dress, do it, you won't regret it!",5
Absolutely love this dress! fits true to size and makes anyone look fabulous,5
"Per other reviewers, i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers. it is short (cropped), but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses.",5
"I have alst year's version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...

i usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on",5
"Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.

a must have for the summer!!!!!!",5
"Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details. soft and not baggy. a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier. i'm 5'7"", 140 pounds with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd. i bought the ""2"" which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt (i'm normally an retailer small but i don't think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted). great comfy weekend piece!",5
"I could wear this every day, it is stylish and comfortable",5
Pretty top. love the color and the large ruffle. makes it great for layering or with a pretty necklace.,5
"Love this top!
it is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.
i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments.
love both colors, and having fun wearing them.
and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic.
runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect.
if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size",5
"Love, love, love this dress. it is very slimming. it hugs you without really touching you. leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel.",5
"I'm 5'3 130# with a 32dd bust. i usually wear small in retailer/ cloth and stone/ running horses. the small fit me fine, but with no room for layers underneath. the small was very snug. would be perfect for california evenings. but, i live in the north east! the medium still has a great shape on me, still fitted at the waist (27inches), but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under. the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress.",5
"This dress is gorgeous!!! i love it! i bought it to wear to a july wedding. i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color. the sizing is on spot! i slipped it on and it was comfortable, easy and stylish. i am 5'7"" and typically xs. it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos. it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight! i am in love!",5
"This shirt is one of my favorite retailer purchases ever! it is well made and is perfect for work or the weekend. the first time i wore it, i received so many compliments!",5
"I want to live in this sweatshirt. it's so comfy, but also well-cut and lays nicely, not boxy at all. i'm typically a 10-12 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy.",5
"After missing out on last year's similar dress, i am so glad i finally purchased this one! it is beautiful in person. i bought to wear to a wedding, but i am curious if others think it might be too white? i bought the peach color. i will keep this dress no matter what. hope they come out with more next season!",5
I read the reviews and because this jacket is pilcro i took a chance. i was thrilled when i rceived this jacket. darker color of denim with weathered edges. i absolutely love it. don't let it get away. great jean jackets are hard to come by.,5
"Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i didn't give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i'd love it even more if it wasn't distressed at all, then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it's my favorite, great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors!",5
The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring.,5
Love it; the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim.,5
I love these. i'm between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s. they fit well. as expected. very nice fabric. good design. have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in. fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice.,5
"I lost my favorite denim jacket on a trip a few years ago and haven't found one i really liked again...until now. great quality - just heavy enough but not too heavy, just stretchy enough but not too stretchy, great color/design. no complaints. i read the other reviews and was happy to have ordered one size larger than my normal. i typically take a small but the medium in this is perfect. it is possible i actually like this jacket better than the one i lost several years ago, which is a big endo",5
"Beautiful colors and silhouette (i got the navy). the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk. i've gotten a ton of compliments on it. i'm 5'9"" and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee, and the low hem falls to my ankles.",5
I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring / summer. the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tucked-in. the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color.,5
I'm glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it's roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it's very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim.,5
"I'm 5'4"" 125 lbs ordered small. fits perfect. super soft denim. love the color love the worn in feel",5
"I have been searching for the perfect denim jacket and this it! i love the darker color, more modern day less 80s. it runs a little small. i am always either a s or xs at retailer. lately, their clothes seem to be running a little bigger, so i have been an xs in most tops. when i order online, i never know which size to get. i ordered an xs, however it was very tight in the arms and across the shoulders. i wanted to be able to roll the sleeves up, so i returned it for a s and it fits great. i was",5
I have received so many compliments. it's my favorite,5
"I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was!
it is an absolute must-have!",5
"I love this little jean jacket! i am petite and usually get a xxsp , but went for a size up. i'm glad i did. it fits a little snug. the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim. the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me. i love this - over maxi dresses, tanks, etc... adorable jacket - great buy!!",5
"This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale, but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online, i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i'm small-chested so both the s and m fit, but the seam on the s fit a bit higher, which was more flattering on me, so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down",5
"I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don't live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs, 5'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on, they just don't look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a",5
"I purchased the navy color of this dress. not only did it look good, but felt good as well. since it is for a wedding, i also purchased a white crochet cropped ""sweater"" to wear over as well, making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom. could not have been happier.",5
"This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight, but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i've gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep, but doesn't show so much cleavage that you couldn't wear it to work.",5
"Love this top! made with 100% cotton, a vintage look, and flattering details this top is a winner for me. i think it fits true to size (got my regular size 0) and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short (5'3""). it is somewhat see through, but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work, i think it can be worn without a cami. the perfect lightweight, comfortable, standout piece for the summer time :)",5
"I really like this blouse a lot. very very easy to wear!! i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend. very flattering and great blue color!!! very happy with this purchase. highly recommend. i am 5'6"" short torso and my usual 6 worked.",5
I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri,5
Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn't know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven't worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i'm usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it's a great buy especially since it's on sale now.,5
"This is an awesome vest - so soft, cozy, and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did, i'll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though.",5
"I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i'm usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes, polka dots and sweet flowers.",5
"This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin, light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket.",5
"This is a beautiful blouse...sheer and feminine. i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual. it is a full top...can't tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms. so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size. this is supposed to be a full, shorter fit...i would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b",5
"The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5'5""there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots, flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined, but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets.",5
"I didn't think anything of this top online (i really don't care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i'm currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5'3"" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p",5
"I absolutely love this sweater!! it's soft, easy to wash, and looks great!",5
The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish.,5
I love this tee! the material is thick but not too thick. it's highly flattering- i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings. the shimmer on the front adds something special.,5
"I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that's really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer's sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts. 

my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily.",5
"This top was way too short (i'm only 5'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide, it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves, ruffle) are beautiful, unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i've have several blouses made by one fine day, which fit nicely, for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size, even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong.",1
My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter.,5
"This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter. it's versatile- i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs! there's so many options i cannot wait to put this gorgeous piece to use! just as an fyi, the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them. this may not even be noticeable if you're not looking right up close. for me, this adds to the unique quality",5
"I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person! the description didn't give as much information as i wanted so i'm going to be very detailed in this review. i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose (two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time), and i'll have to hand sew others on more tightly. my usual size is a pxs or p0, and there were no petite sizes available. however the size 0 fits perfectly, no alterations need",5
"When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me.",5
"Wasn't sure about this top based on reviews, but glad i purchased! pretty print, looks great with denim. very loose, flowy top. hangs a little short, but that's the style of this blouse. fit true to size. i usually wear a 2/4 and xs/sm with 30dd. size small worked for me.",5
This too is so beautiful in person. there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming. i love this top with business attire and denim. fits tts.,5
"I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft, good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i'm sure i would get a lot of use out of this top, but ultimately it didn't thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still, a very nice top. i may buy it eventually, especially if it goes on sale.",5
"I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush.",5
I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely. i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office. the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out. really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal!,5
"I am 5.6"", 138 pounds. i purchased this in a size small. it is flowy and not too short. it has a comfortable, but still feminine and beautiful fit. one of my favorite new blouses...the red print is gorgeous",5
"I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely, though - pretty and funky at the same time. it's sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer.",5
"I saw this in-store, tried it on, and was sold. it is not just super soft but very flattering on. i am petite, 105 lbs and bought the xs in black- the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed. i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans.",5
"Love this. it's heavy/warm, stylish and a great throw on any outfit. oversized style.",5
"The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.

i'm sure this could have been cute, but who wants a top that looks lik",1
Tts. i'm wearing a small. the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants. washed nicely. layers flat to dry. had to iron the shell underneath. great for casual office.,5
"I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it's pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it, and find it's flattering for my curvy figure.",5
"I love the sweatshirt 
 clay color is very different it's a nice light fabric with nice detailed edges 
 although it is an oversized piece it hangs and fits well although i am petite
 great light sweatshirt for spring and summer",5
"Love the patterns and the length.  i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets. 
it's really a special piece and on sale, very worth it!",5
"I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it. i am either an xs or s in antho, and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy. normally i would have overlooked this shirt as it's rather unimpressive on the hanger, but it was on sale so i tried it on. very cute when tried on! it fits well across the shoulders but isn't too clingy in the body, which i like. the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor",5
"Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i don't think it's too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5'8"" and athletic.",5
All the rave reviews are true!  this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it. i'm having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this. this is a great three season layering piece and i'm thrilled i was able to get it on sale.  my only regret was the lack of a petite selection.,5
I love this top. i got it on sale and am so glad that i did. it is a short too but still super flattering. it isn't too boxy on me.,5
I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it's wool i didn't notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent,5
"This has great drape, length, the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints. i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck, so not sure if i will keep, though i don't seem to want to take it off! has a lightweight, boiled wool texture, contrasting print and design so cool!",5
"I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person, and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile, and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly, the pattern is cleverly designed which doesn't compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the",5
"Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it's there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not",5
"An excellent going out to dinner, to a lounge, etc. piece. super flattering, sexy, feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i'm only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits, but this was excellent!",5
I would've looked right over this online but i saw it in store and had to try on. the navy and the white were both cute but i tried the navy. i'm usually a m but went with the s b/c it looked better fitted. this shirt has a very vintage feel to it and is slinky and comfy. i can't wait to wear. would look great with white jeans!,5
This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it. it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness . i like everything about it!,5
I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater.,5
"This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it - love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful. the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight, so definitely appropriate for winter, fall, and cooler spring days. i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot - it was wider down the torso and a little shorter (not tunic length like picture). i'm 5'7"" with a longer torso and this hit maybe mid-bum and",5
"I don't normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn't help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn't even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag.",1
"I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however, after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing, so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person, and very soft and warm. it's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5'-7"", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly, though it's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos.",5
"Great fit! no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size. very cute! for reference, i&#39;m 5&#39;2, 115 lbs and take a 26p. they look just like they do on the model. i highly recommend!",5
"The length is perfect. the cut of the hemline makes it off the charts cute. i love it w ghillie type flats or booties. pair w a big warm sweater, or a sleek turtleneck, and watch heads turn as you enter the room! i promise! love this skirt.",5
"This dress is beautifully constructed. it is very fitted and does run on the small side. it will be a perfect derby dress. the lace is lovely and the pearl buttons are great touch. age appropriate for anyone..a very 
pretty dress. simple, classic and gorgeous!",5
"The color is a very soft peach, and the knit top over the gauze is a very light, summer-weight knit. i can see this being worn casual, or dressed up with a statement necklace and nice skirt / pants.",5
"I bought the dress that has the cream skirt with large flowers. i wore it for a wedding and was not only very comfortable with the pockets and the cotton top, i looked good. i got a lot of compliments on the outfit. people thought it was a shirt and blouse rather than a dress. i loved the high low skirt. the sizing was accurate and the dress is easy to clean.",5
"Soft, comfortable, stylish. i eagerly awaited the arrival of this beautiful sweater and was not disappointed. the sizing was accurate for a perfect fit and i love the feminine detailing and shape of the necklne. the ribbons add an extra touch of style to a sweater that is both casual and elegant at the same time. very versatile.",5
"Adorable sweater with a loose knit that helps slim down my man-back appearance. cut is tapered to the body but with a soft flare at the bottom hem. not clingy, very soft fabric doesn't accentuate bulges so i am happy about it's forgiving silhouette.",5
"I walked into retailer with low hopes of finding a dress for a friend's spring wedding, as a lot of this season's dresses are more casual, but was drawn to this pretty number for multiple reasons: it can certainly be dressed up or down depending upon accessories, the fabric feels incredible, it has pockets, and it's really fun yet classy as heck. typically i wear a 10/m in dresses, but they only had a 12 in store, so i took it and made it work by tightening the sash a bit extra and wearing a bra w",5
"I was able to snatch this dress up just before it sold out (and i see it's now back in stock!). the quality of the fabrics is outstanding, not flimsy at all. the top is stretchy. normally i would wear a 2 at retailer, but the only choice i had was 0 and it fit. i am 5'5"" tall, 125 lbs. everything about this dress makes me smile and i can't wait to wear it to my holiday party! don't hesitate if you are on the fence.",5
I saw this dress online and immediately went to the store to try on! it took three sales asscoaites to help me zip the dress but once it was on it was beautiful! the bodice fits really nicely. true to size. there was extra fabric around the waist bust nothing that made the fit look weird. love love love!!! wearing for christmas eve!,5
"I got he green color with gray accent stitching, looks awesome with gray tone leggings. super soft, definitely runs a little big (5'6"" 140 lbs i ordered the small) but not in an unflattering way.",5
"Love this tunic, it's super comfy & cute. i have in cream and love so much i ordered in mint. looks great with jeans and boots",5
"I really love this lace-up shirt, but i only liked it in black on me. i like it open like the model is wearing it, but i had to have it a little more closed because the lace part does go down a ways-and i felt like i was revealing a little too much. i would likely wear it open, but then have to pair it with a cami underneath to feel comfortable. i absolutely love the whole outfit as-pictured, and also reviewed the polka dot pants. i wish the laces were a little longer than they are-if you have i",5
"Love this blouse, it;s super comfy, looks awesome with jeans. this blouse runs true to size i purchased in my normal size small.",5
"I was hesitant based on the reviews, but i'm glad i ordered this dress (in blue). the material is like a french dot texture that is soft but still a bit structured. i had no issues with the fit. it's appropriately just a little oversized. the styling is very mod!",5
"I purchased this jacket in green, x-small a while back and wasn?t 100% sure about it due to the size. i?m 5?3?, 117 lbs and a 33a and thought it was a little snug so i tried on the small and that was way too big so i kept the xs. i have worn it a few times and it does look great however i can only wear thin tops with it. recently i purchased the black, x-small and this i love. it?s looser then the green so i can get away with thicker tops. 
i do recommend both jackets. they are pricey for what",5
"I love this jacket over a dress! it's snug fitting so can't wear anything bulky under it, but super stylish and comfy stretchy material. it's a bit pricey but i get a lot of wear out of it so worth it to me.",5
I'm 5'1 and 110 lbs.  i ordered this in a xsp and i could barely zip it up.  and when i did i couldn't breathe. i tried again and ordered a sp and it's perfect! now i just need somewhere to wear it.,5
"Beautiful shirt, hits me a little higher. i'm not sure i'm going to keep it just because i have something similar but its a beautiful top. i'm 5'6"" and carrying a little extra baby weight right now so i'm an 8-10 instead of my usual 6-8. i ordered an 8 and it fit well.",5
"I love this blouse because it's great for work with cardigan over it, and great for going out with skirt, pants or jeans. it is tts and very flattering, light weight, and comfortable.",5
"I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted, left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it doesn't need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o",5
Great looking jacket with attitude. the color is more like a faded black or deep charcoal grey. i'm usually a large petite but this is snug in the chest. luckily it's a knit so i can make it work by zipping it partway and leaving the top half open.,5
"These jeans are so cute! they are perfect for petites too! i am fit, look way younger than my age and get so many compliments when i wear these jeans. i'm. i'm 5'2"", 115 libs and they definitely fit tight in a good way. just like the photo pretty much. they are not small like the white mother ankle fray jeans for sale on the site now. those definitely run smaller so these are true to size with a tight fit.",5
I live in los angeles and this is the perfect beginning of fall jacket! i've worn it with dresses and with jeans. definitely has enough extra room to slip a hoodie or small seater on underneath when it gets colder. it's soft and stylish. the only downside is that the pockets aren't really deep enough to put anything in.,5
"Nice tee, true red,3/4 sleeves, lacing is a nice touch. good quality and great sale price.",5
"When i ordered this little jacket i knew i would like it, upon arrival i fell in love. it is a little edgy with leather detailing and with stretch in all the right places, the crop is super flattering. appeared online to be a bit more of a sweatshirt material but it has so much structure and holds its shape!",5
I got this shirt in red and black. both colors vibrant and material of shirt is nice cotton blend. will get lots of use from both shirts.,5
This is the most flattering shirt--love the fit and color!,5
"I love this shirt so much that i've now bought it in 2 colors -- the olive green and the red. probably would have bought it in black too if i didn't already have enough black shirts. it's both a plain and simple tee, but with the fun lace-up detail at the neckline that keeps it from being boring.

it runs true to size but is very fitted. however, due to the thickness of the material, i didn't feel like any unflattering bumps or lumps were being highlighted, despite how close the shirt fit to my",5
"Don't try this on, if you don't plan to buy it. it feels amazing!!! i bought the black and it is a lovely charcoal color and matches so much.",5
"I like the lace-up trend, but most designs are too revealing. this shirt is super sexy, but not immodest. i bought it in black and am now buying another color. to me, the fabric feels soft and thick, very nice.",5
"Great shirt. the neckline is super flattering. the fabric has some weight to it. right now i am in a ""fat stage""...and it still looked good. it will look even better without the midriff bulge! i bought the shirt in black. i'm thinking of ordering it in red...it's that good.",5
"This is a great shirt that goes with everything. it's super sexy and i have to say....the girls look great in it! i bought the black first and went back for the green. the quality of the shirt is great...not cheap and no smell, at least not in my experience,  like was mentioned by another reviewer. i can't say enough about how cute this shirt is!",5
"I purchased this blouse because i love a 70's vibe in my tops. it is a beautiful, colorful top, but the colors weren't flattering on me. having said that, the cut is nice, the fabric is lightweight and flows nicely, and the fit was fine on me. i am a curvy 5'5"" with a 36 c cup. go for it if this is a style you like. one other note, i wish it had been a bit longer, but i am older and prefer a little more coverage. it's just a personal preference. i think the picture is an accurate depiction.",5
"This is one of those you have to try it on to appreciate the lovely unique design. it is a very unique, flowing, romantic piece. it is sheer and i would wear a nude camisole underneath. i am normally a size small and bought a size 2 (i tried on a 6 in the store just to see what it looked like, fell in love with the look and the retailer associate recommended i buy a size 2). love it!",5
"I got to try this on today and i really like it. the fabric is a normal t-shirt kind of fabric (i was hoping it would have been kind of special) and the v-neck in the front does go down a ways so that some cleavage is showing. i would feel comfortable wearing it as-is outside of work, but would have to pair it with a cami if i would going to wear it to work. normally, i am not a huge fan of v-neck in the back and it drives me crazy thanks cami's these days are often made with a ""versatile"" v and",5
"A breath of fresh air. spring flowers! easy to wear. very feminine and flattering. looks great with denim, orange, reds , etc. very happy with this purchase.",5
"Nice fit and flare style, not clingy at all. i got the grey color, petite large, fits perfect. will wear with tights/boots or booties. lots of color options to accessorize with.",5
"This top is soo pretty with a cool edge.
it looks and feels like really good quality.",5
"This dress is flattering in all the right places. it has a gorgeous skirt with a comfortable, form-fitting top. it provides just the right amount of coverage. i love it so much i bought it in two colors!",5
I love this top! it's easily both day and night-worthy with a splash of sexiness in a front peek-a-boo design. lovely embossed design all over.,5
This bra is extremely comfortable and surprisingly supportive considering the lack of padding or firm material. it also runs large.,5
"I love this sweater dress and get compliments every time i wear it.. i bought the navy in size xs. the pattern and colors are just fun and youthful, although you don't have to be young to look good in this dress. the dress is fitted, but the skirt flares, making it flattering if you have hips like me. the material is not too heavy so you can wear this 3 seasons fall, winter, spring. as other reviews have mentioned the dress is short. i am 5'9"" so it does hit well above my knees. this isn't an is",5
Extremely flattering. an easy dress to wear - good choice for both day and evening,5
"I took a chance and tried on this jacket today at the store. at first i was worried that it might look boxy on me but as soon as i put it on, it was love at first sight! it's so cute and very comfy! the sleeves are slightly long on me but that's been a recurrent issue regarding all my jackets. i'm only 5'3"" about 124 lbs. and it fit me very well. because it's a bit cropped, it makes me look taller. glad the weather is starting to warm up so i can find more excuses to wear it. i didn't need anoth",5
"I tried on the usual xs in the patterned style, and it fit really nicely. the colors are very nice in person, vibrant. teh cut is flatering and gives a nice definition at the waist i also love the lace up neck detailing. the sleeves flutter out, and will give a bit more volume, if i would change something that would be it. i would make the sleeves more fitter or perhaps shirter with the flutter. i am 115 lbs for reference...",5
"I had it on my wish list for a long time, not sure whether i should purchase, i even hesitated when it went on sale, but boy, am i glad i did order it... it is crazy comfortable, flattering, and love that it looks black but is blue... i ordered both xs and xs p and decided to go with the petite as it will look super cute in the fall with boots. not too short (i am 5 foot 1.5)... the fake leather part concerned me at first, but i like it now... nothing bad ot say about it!",5
"I ordered this dress in size xl in the grey/red/yellow combination. i love everything about this dress. it's comfortable. the colors are cheerful. the proportions of where the stripes are placed works. but, i have to return this dress. it's too short for what i'm comfortable wearing. i saw from the photos that this comes mid-thigh on the taller models. i hoped that would mean it would be more knee-length for me. unfortunately, it's just too short and i'd feel self-conscious. i don't want to deal",5
I had to order this blouse since it is named after the town i live in. it does not disappoint. the flowers are so pretty and it has great style. there is a little piece in the neckline so it is not too revealing. the sleeves are loose and cover the bra strap underneath. the back has a little bit of elastic so it does not look like a maternity shirt and it gives you some shape. i can't wait for it to warm up and to wear this!,5
Perfect trans top.  skinnies or boyfriend and booties.  love the mixed prints,5
"This top reminds me of the special tops i got ""once upon a time""...when retailer adopted a more curatorial approach to their store. this is a beautifully-made top...quite dramatic but comfortable. i've received many compliments each time i've worn it. it has wonderful drapery and movement.",5
This blouse is so pretty and well made. it will be a new favorite with dark jeans and boots. it is very boho and a lovely blouse to feel dressed up a bit on a jeans day. loose in a flattering way (it does not look like a maternity top). very happy!,5
"I ordered size small and medium because i can go either way depending on brands. and both look great! there is no significant difference except medium fell about 1 inch longer. i am 5'4"" and size small hem fell about 1"" above knee. size medium felt tab bit more loose but i thought fabric may stretch a bit after wear so i'm keeping size small. what a beautiful dress! although the body of dress is jersey material, it is lined so there is good coverage. i tend to not like ""faux leather"" since they",5
"This top is so pretty and feminine. the different floral patterns work very well together and add an interesting flare to this unique blouse. the fit is very comfortable yet still very flattering due to the empire waist and flared sleeves. the fit is true to size, i usually wear a size medium or 10 in retailer tops and the size 10 fit quite nicely. this top is a great addition to any spring wardrobe and should transition nicely into summer as well.",5
"Very cute, very comfortable. for me aesthetics and comfort must go hand in hand. this dress fits the bill.",5
Very comfortable and versatile. got lots of compliments.,5
"The combination of vintage and bohemian styles seems as if it would be flattering on all figure types. and i love the combination of smaller and larger prints. the only thing i didn't like is that on the blouse i received, placement of the larger print on the bodice is asymmetrical (unlike the photo). it might not bother some customers, but it wasn't what i was expecting, so i ordered a new one. i may keep it even if the second one is off, because other than that small thing, i think the top wou",5
"Saw this online and had to try it on when i found it in the store. i usually wear an 8 or a 10 depending on how things run, (i'm a 34 dd), so i tried on both sizes. i really could not see much of a difference between the two and was torn as to which size to get. the 10 was just a tad looser so i went with that one, but seriously i could not find or feel much of a difference. it is a very figure flattering top, and a plus that you can machine wash it. simply awesome!",5
Love love this dress. fits so great. i normally wouldn't have picked this dress. more preppy than my normal style. fits amazing. my hubby has complimented me more on this dress than anything else i've ever owned. the fit & flare style is super flattering i felt it fit tts.,5
"This is one of my absolute favorites! the design is perfect, and the fabric is so beautiful. i don't love the coral color, but the mixed pattern is amazing. it runs a little large. i sized down one size and it fit perfectly. it's very flowy and comfortable. it's these unique, special designs that end of being my favorite retailer purchases. i've gotten so many compliments. very highly recommend!",5
"Beautiful colors, especially the pink. i am 5'3"" and about 124 lb. i got the small petite but am thinking of exchanging it for the regular xs. not only is it short hem-wise, which i don't really mind, but it is short in the waist. very pretty and good fabric.",5
This dress caught my eye because i don't have anything like it. i wear between a m & l and preferred the large in this dress because i have a large bust. i usually wear a 10 in slacks and 12 in tops. i love the lace on this dress because it looks very delicate in the picture but it is very heavy and well sewn onto the fabric. it is durable while still looking elegant. i also like that it is in navy and not black. it is also nicely lined. i plan on wearing a colorful scarf with this dress.,5
A beautiful combination of eyelet with a soft fabric which lays beautifully. this does not make you look bigger then you are and i kept tts so the eyelet did not pull. mine fits perfectly. i personally will wear a cami under it as it is a bit sheer for me. it has an almost peacock print to it in colors of brown and tan. the black buttons down the back adds interest and charm. just adore it!,5
This dress looks great on me. it gives a slender appearance which hides a lot and it's easy and comfortable to wear.,5
I first saw this jacket hanging at the store and it didn't look very cute. i saw it again on sale so i decided to try it on. i'm so glad i did! the inside gray material is so soft. i have broad shoulders and this jacket did not hinder my arms at all. it is very comfortable. i bought the x-small and was very surprised at how roomy it was. the sleeves are a tad bit long but the gray inner lining has an elastic cuff so it can be pushed up. not sure if the xx-small would've been too small or if the,5
"For me, the tag sale is an opportunity to take a second look at items that i may have overlooked earlier, to pick up something fun at a good price. i found this dress in two colors in my size in the store! i took my usual xxsp at 32-24.5-32. length is perfect - just above the knee and the top is flattering with not too much fabric in the skirt. overall, this is a really cute staple dress. looking forward to wearing it in the spring. larger busted ladies size up. it is meant to be fitted in the t",5
I absolutely love everything about this dress. it can be dressed up or down. no complaints.,5
The horizontal lines on the skirt and top gives the wearer and very nice dress. i am short so i got the 6 petite and it fits perfectly. the fabric is thick and stretchy.,5
This is a great top to pair with jeans to step a casual night up a notch.,5
"The colors are more vibrant than the photo indicates. indeed, though, the dress is very short and does pair well with leggings and boots.

i like that the dress highlights my hour glass figure, but with a generous nod to my curves with the accommodating skater skirt.

love it! will be easy to wear casually and work appropriate, too. the sale price was a huge bonus.",5
Top of the line! very well made and on sale to boot. i love the style and received a compliment from my sister when i wore it. i love the layered look.,5
"Perfect little summer tunic that is very flattering. paired with a skirt, jeans or cropped black pants- this top is perfect! the cut in the front is not overly deep- so a cami is not necessary. i am usually a l or xl or 12 in retailer tops and i have a 10 in this top. so it is sized slightly larger than usual.",5
This blouse fit better than i expected. looks great with jeans and is an easy go to top!,5
I love this top! not sure if i would picked it up in the store; i received it as a gift from my husband. kudos to him as it was a great choice. i love that the sheerness and lace make me feel a little sexy but the long sleeves and camisole offer the modesty i tend to crave. really beautiful and can be worn either with jeans or a dressier skinny pant for a night out. hd in paris never fails to please with their aesthetic and quality.,5
"I've admired the various iterations of this dress and finally found one in the sale room, much to my delight! i'm generally a sale shopper, so this doesn't mean i didn't think it was priced well. i have the oatmeal top with yellow/gold/orange pattern on the skirt in xs. the small fits comfortably up top, but on my petite frame, the top just looked too big, so i went with xs. i suppose the straps are a bit confusing, but their easy to figure out if you just look at them for a moment before puttin",5
"This dress is comfortable as well as flattering, which does not happen very often!
looks good with navy tights too!",5
Love love love this jacket!! great spring and fall weather.. very stylish!!,5
I purchased this dress because i have a similar one with a linen skirt from the spring. the skirt on this dress is a heavier fabric and it lays very nicely. the top provides good coverage for my larger chest and i took my typical xs size. i would definitely recommend this purchase.,5
"This jacket looked so good and felt so comfortable on- i almost didn't send back the first one that arrived with a little bit of damage at the bottom of the inner zippered sweatshirt, but i did exchange it and am just as happy with the fit and feel of the second one. it hangs well no matter how you fasten the front, or leave it open. great looking, casual but stylish and neat. a good grey, and a good blue.",5
"I went to my local store and they only had the blue dress in stock, i had seen it online and i didn't expect to like the blue one. i tried it on anyway, and it was adorable! i struggled to choose, but i ordered the gray one at the store and they shipped it directly to me. it arrived quickly and i love it!",5
"This jacket has a nautical look which is a refreshing change for this year. it is double breasted & a stretchy cotton, which i love. i am a big fan of cotton. it appealed to me so much that i ordered both the white & the navy in the regular size small. i am of small build at 5'3"", 117# & expected that the sleeves c/b a little long. i avoid ordering petite size jackets b/c sometimes they are snug in the shoulders. ok, so the regular s was a good length at the bottom of my hips, but arms were bagg",5
This top is gorgeous and versatile. i wear it with jeans and dress it up with a skirt. so happy to have this in my wardrobe.,5
"The jacket is great, the quality is very good and the fit too, the best part is how it looks !",5
"I was looking for a stylish spring/fall jacket and this one seemed to fit the bill. i was shocked by the quality and softness of the material and construction of this jacket. i could honestly not believe how comfortable and cute this felt and looked on me. i can't wear it enough! i am a short 5'2"" but 36d and have 31"" waist so i ordered a size m and l to see which would work best. as it turned out the m fit with plenty of room! i am normally a 12/14 so i was surprised by this. if you are on the",5

"I was hoping this would go on sale and now it finally has! i loved this dress just as much in person as i have online. the fabric is interesting-it looks almost plastic in the online pictures but don't be fooled, it is still a comfortable fabric. it is almost like lots of diamond pieces were actually sewn together to make this dress and i love it. there is a sipper down the side to make it easier to get into, but also in the back there is bunched up fabric which is made to be ore bendable for th",5
"I tried this dress on and felt amazing in it.  i got home and showed my husband my purchases.  i told him i wasn't sure if i should have bought this one and told him to be honest with me.  he said it looked great and he was glad i bought it.  so great for a spring wedding. fits true to size.  i am 125 5'4"" c-cup and i bought my normal size 0.  this made my waist look really small.",5
"This is a very nice jumpsuit; reviewers were correct stating that torso is long & fit better a taller person. as soon as i read the reviews i went on and placed an order for size 8, i'm 6ft tall 160lb and it has been very difficult to find a jumpsuit to fit my long torso. this one however turned out to be perfect! true to size and fit, not only that, the fabric is very soft and good quality, very interesting style of the jumpsuit, looks much better in person! i particularly liked cropped, wide-l",5
"This top runs super small in the upper arms, shoulder area..could not even stretch out my arms! ...other then that major problem, the length and body fit were perfect...i am true med and/or large in all retailer tops so i tried sizes 10, 12 and neither worked for me due to arm/shoulder fit...disappointed because it really is a beautiful top...",1

"This top is so lovely, i was worried of the color on my pale skin, but it is complementary, nice warm tones. yes, it is a tank, but i can see this as a transition piece into fall with a nice blazer, jeans, boots... the xs regular is perfect for me, length is adequate. if i were to go with petite, i might think it is too short. it is flowy, but still has shape, more than a swing top, so very flattering. the back is really cute too, definitely need a strapless for me, due to the thin straps...",5
"I love these! they are a perfect addition to my fall wardrobe, and just like all other pilcro jeans, they are a great fit and true to size.",5

"I'm surprised i'm the first to review this dress! it is a must for the holidays and any special occasion! it is absolutely gorgeous! it is so feminine and seductive; it's one of those dresses that would be stunning on anyone! it is a quality dress, beautifully made, looks just like the photo. i'm 5'9"" & the hemline falls at the top of my knees. the neckline is exquisite & really ""makes"" the dress. i purchased the black version but if i was younger i'd get it in red as it would garner quite a bit",5
"This shirt is very nice quality and looks stunning. it does run tight in the shoulder area and is a bit of a challenge getting off, but as long as i don't rip it one of these times all will be well! it looks so nice on that i overlook that design flaw.",5
"Love this blouse! its so darn cute. the fabric is soft, flows nicely and is just absolutely stunning without being over the top. it falls at the lower part of my hip. the softness of the fabric would make this easy to tuck in. the body of the shirt, sleeves, cuffs and placket are contrasting florals in black and creamy white. the top part is a brownish burgundy color and the flowers/butterflies are embroidered in goldenrod yellow, peach, creamy white, two mauve tones, turquoise and brown. the li",5

"Love this blouse! i took a chance on ordering it and wasn't sure what i would think. this blouse is fabulous!!! it has a boho-chic flair to it in a sophisticated way. it's one of those ""special"" pieces from retailer; elegant, quirky, sophisticated.
the details are great, too. of course the embroidery is beautiful; but there are a couple more fun details. the cuffs on the sleeve have multiple buttons; so that you can button them tight or just enough to roll the cuff once. when the cuff is r",5
Love this top! it is super flattering with a long floaty body. i usually wear a 4 but sized up to a 6 due to the reviews and am happy with it but think a 4 would have fit as well.,5
Love tanks and this one is sweet and flowy. great with jeans/shorts or slacks with a jacket for the office. beautiful yellow floral with fun straps in the back that you can wear with a bra. front neckline is cut narrow so bra straps show but with nude or plastic straps it's not that big a deal.,5
"This is truly unique top, the  detail around the neck is a nice change!!!",5
"I am 5'2"" 125 pounds and i bought the 4p. the fabric is high quality and does not cling at all but instead drapes and in a very flattering way. add that to the cut of this jumpsuit and you have elongating, very flattering lines. i could not be more pleased and regret not having bought this item earlier, since i would have enjoyed wearing it during the holidays. as other reviewers said, it is adorable and a winner.",5
"Great little transitional piece. i bought the blk/blk floral one & it's not your usual top. sort of quirky & one of a kind looking. i think it's crazy comfortable & i just love it! even its a bit chilly outdoors, toss on a scarf round one's neck & head on out. not the kind of top you'd wear with a jacket.",5
This top has a western look with lots of black and some burgundy shades.  it is very cute and the fabric is soft.,5
"I was lucky enough to get a hold of this intarsia sweater dress after the sale and i wish i had purchased this the first time round. it is absolutely stunning, flattering, comfortable and unique! i am 5'3"" and the regular hem fit me just fine at the ankles. i think this dress runs both tts to a bit large so i would size down if your small framed and stay your usual if your busty or broad shouldered. perfectly complements my taupe booties that i already owned and a my taupe maxi sweater that has",5
"These run very small!! they are also short, almost like a crop pant. the fit was so weird that i won't even exchange for a bigger size.",1
"I purchased this top in a great sale! fits great,true to size i am xsmall-small for reference, purchased small. i ended up putting a bandeau bra on with it to feel more comfortable. it would be great in the fall with a cardigan/ sweater, or a blazer. super cute to wear alone in summer with jeans!!",5
"I am returning the dress because it smells heavily of the last purchaser's deodorant and perfume. it was actually nauseating to put on. i am disappointed with retailer that i was sold this dress, full price, in this condition. otherwise, the dress is lovely. it is true to size. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs and the size 0 was perfect.",5
"I had been on the hunt for a plaid bomber to rock this fall and this retailer edition bomber surpassed all of my expectations! it literally pairs great with everything fall.. chokers, boots, dresses; you name it! it also fits very true to size. not too fit to your body, and a little loose, but not too loose.. just like a bomber jacket should! i highly recommend this product.",5
"I am pear-shaped and often have a hard time finding pants that fit just right. these did the trick!! they are slim in the waist, but have plenty of room for bigger hips. the overall fit is body skimming/hugging, but they are not tight or uncomfortable in any way! and i have no gapping at the waist. the fabric has a slight sheen to it and a little stretch, but they will be a perfect pant for the office. for reference, i am 5'4"", 34/26/38, and i got a 6 regular.",5
This jacket is well-made and smart looking. it gave me just the boost i needed today at a difficult meeting. thank you retailer!,5
"Perfect fit. did not lose its shape. thicker material. great quality for a great price. definitely  a wardrobe  staple. can be dressed up or down. work (business) appropriate. fits tts. for reference,  i am 5'0"", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fits perfect. falls right above ankle like pictured. if they had more colours, i would get them too :)",5
"The fit on these pants is just right for me. i have curvy hips and a slender waste and legs. these pants don't gap in the back, as fitted pants often can. easy to dress up or down. the color hasn't held up as well as i hoped, so take care when laundering.",5
"Very comfortable fabric and fits nicely. i am 5'10"" like it states the model is, and it falls shorter on me that viewed, but still looks nice. it will be an easy dress to use for different looks.",5
"When i tried on this bathing suit, i decided to not try on any others. it was just right! i usually find bathing suit shopping difficult and no fun--as i can never find a suitable bathing suit. this suit looks nice/flattering, and i can also move around in it and it stays in place. i purchased it in the navy and i'm going to order it in another pattern as well. it looks modern and classic; it's a chic style. i'm a size 6 in dresses, and i purchased a size 10 in this bathing suit.",5
Love love love these leggings and what an amazing price point!!!,5
"The colors and fit of this suit are even better than described. it is the most comfortable and flattering one-piece i have ever tried on. 

as noted by other reviewers, there is limited support in the chest; this suit will keep you covered but does not provide lift.",5
"I had been looking for a one-piece that is fashionable yet practical. fabric is beautiful, fit is impeccable, no complaints on lack of support. i find if you tie it tight up top it's very practical. this was the perfect choice for me. i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and ordered the small.",5
These sold out in my size 16 before i even knew they existed! (probably a great indication that your in-between and plus-size customers are hungry for more options from you). please restock so i can get in on this apparently-perfect pant!,5
This suit fits like a glove! i've had five kids and am currently nursing my last baby so i was looking for a suit to wear to the beach this summer when i'm just not feeling a bikini. this is it! it's comfortable and not binding easy to nursing and swim in. overall worth the extra splurge. i'm tall too so it was plenty long on my torso.,5
"Cute top! the bright red crochet shoulders and back add the perfect pop of color to the light blue pinstriped front. it's a little loose and boxy around the bust area but overall i think it's a flattering shape. i got the regular s and don't find it too short. for reference i'm 5'2"", 134 lb, 34b. i often wear petite sizes but due to other reviews mentioning that the top is short i ordered the regular size and am happy with the length and fit.",5
This top looked super cute online but when it came it was super short and boxy. looked like a tent on me. this one went back the same day it came!,1
"Comfy easy dress. i bought the black version. fabric is so soft. i wear this around house, but don't hesitate to run out in it if needed. i bought medium so it was roomier and for length since i'm tall. small also fit, but was shorter than i wanted.",5
"I had my reservations given that i'm petite (5'2"", 108lbs) and it's midi style. i'm glad that i took a chance. i bought the red motif and it's beautiful. it's wrinkle-free right out of the package. the color is vibrant and the style is classic and effortless. fits true-to-size. great for work with a black tee as shown in the picture.",5
Cute comfortable top. fits well and will look great with skinny jeans.,5
"I purchased this dress in black and love it. its hot where i live so i am always looking for a lightweight dress that i can throw on either after the pool or out and about. i wore it to an outside concert with sandals and a simple braid, it was perfect! considering ordering it in another color!",5
Perfect fit! can be dressed up or down! more colors please!,5
"These are great pants. i love the fit and the taper of the leg. these will be my ""go to"" black pants for the fall season!",5
"I waited three months for these pants. when they finally arrived, i was mostly pleased. they seemed like the staple pant everyone is raving about. and they should have been.
problem one: they bag out. i got one wear out of them before i needed to wash and hang to dry (regained shape then).
problem two: the crotch split! in the front! i'm a teacher. i sincerely hope no one noticed! i read other reviews about this problem and don't know if i got a bad batch or if a similar fate is awaiting other",1
"This swimsuit fits exactly as i had hoped. i purchased it in the teal dot and it is a little brighter than in the photos, but i ended up liking that better. it is well made with thick (but not too thick) lined material. also, i was initially worried that the deep v-neck may be too deep for my liking, but once i had it on,it looked classic and not showy. i love the suit.",5
I love these pants. i bought as basic pants to dress up or down and they look good with flats or heels. also i like you can wash instead of dry clean.,5
These pants are awesome - please make them in other colors besides black and navy!,5
"This is an amazing swimsuit. i had been on the hunt for the perfect one piece. i wanted something a bit on the modest side, but still sexy, and i hoped for a unique print that would make it stand out. the icing on the cake would be a suit that is functional enough to either lay poolside or scuba dive. enter this swimsuit from retailer. i fell in love with the teal dot print as it's unlike anything else i've seen - it's absolutely spectacular in person. i love the vibrant blue and the chic d",5
"I really love these pants. just the right fabric, not too thick. so comfy. i do feel they run a bit big. they stretch out quickly so if you are in between sized, choose the smaller one.",5
"I had been searching for a swimsuit that flattered my baby bump and this is it - i'm in love! for reference, i am 5'6"",170-180, 10-12 or m-l depending on the item. however, i'm currently 19 weeks pregnant so im about 185 and growing - so i went with the xl swimsuit. i have a 36c/38d bust and although there is no true support in the top of this suit, it holds the girls in and the deep plunge is just the right amount of sexy. the bottom has modest coverage, showing just a little bit of cheek. i go",5
I bought the first skirt at the store. loved it so much i went online and found this one and bought it too!,5
"I put this runs small but it's a little more tts, except the arms are very slim! if you like to push your sleeves up like this model, you will have to wait for a while to see if the sweater loosens up. length wise it fit me a bit longer than this model and i'm a petite. the color is also darker and not as red as in this sweaters, which i actually prefer. the sweater is much thicker than my other cashmere sweaters. some of the stitching seems stick out as if the sweater is worn inside out, but th",5
Love the fabric fit and cut of this skirt. it hits at just the perfect spot but runs a little large and is more flattering when sizing down (atleast on me) .,5
"This is by far the cutest, most glamorous one piece i have ever tried on! it fits perfectly and is flattering in the right places, it doesn't show too much cleavage and is modest enough for family events. absolutely love this suit in navy. wasn't in love with the rest of the patterns, hoping they come out in more solid colors someday soon!",5
"I don't normally try on tops like this but i liked the product shot so much that i wanted to repeat the outfit. i grabbed a large because it wasa shorter blouse. it was huge. i sized down to the medium and it was still loose but if i were to purchase, it would be that size. the red against the blue was very pretty but i didn't know if felt like a little kid in a uniform. the back did not lie flat, not sure if it was because of my 36d chest or because of the shirt design. it is well made and i th",5
I love this ankle length pant. it is so comfortable wear it with a tunic or tee. i can wear this for 3 seasons!,5
"I think this is the first time i've successfully purchased pants online. i normally have to try a bunch of styles and sizes on before i find the right ones. i gave it a shot with these, and bingo! they are great! they are a bit longer on me than on the model, because i am 5'3"" and did not order a petite. i still like how they look, hitting just above my ankle. just the right blend of conservative and cool for lecturing in front of college undergrads.",5
"Such cute, soft and comfortable shorts. can be worn as night wear or out and about.",5
"I saw these in an email and immediately went to the web to look at them. they fit well and have nice slim look. the bottom of the legs seems to fit a little slimmer on me than in the picture, but they aren't too tight.",5
"Received many compliments the first day i wore them.. amazing fit. disagree with the other post. the
quality is amazing. i wish they had other colors. bought xs",5
"This is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own. i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway. the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable, yet cute. i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique, yet whimsical swimsuit style.",5
This top is gorgeous! this is why i love retailer the quality is amazing. i just love how unique this top is. it's a light jean blue and white pin striped shirt with these beautiful red crochet sleeves. i'm a 34ddd i ordered the large and it's perfect. it is a bit shorter probably because of my chest but i was going to wear it with high waisted shorts anyways.  it's a must buy!,5
"Sale price is a great price for a cute cover-up.  so this is not a polite company dress.  this is a ""i want to show off my cute underwear/bikini/cross-fit bod while i go get a cold pressed juice in venice"" kind of dress.  or you can just wear it at home like i do.  runs small btw, so size up.",5
"These fit me really well. i tend to have a problem finding trousers that fit my more muscular legs and my waist. usually, if it fits my legs the waist is too big. the trousers have some stretch for a better fit. the only downside is that i had go them hemmed (bought regular size).",5
"I often find wearing anything described as 'slim' difficult, but these pants are absolutely wonderful. i bought in a size 12 regular length. they are perfect, both in fit and quality.",5
This midi skirt has a really nice drape with great seasonal colors! can't wait to pair it with my wine color booties!,5
This is a fabulous style top! highly recommend this top. comfortable material. retailer is consistently tried and true to a classy style!,5
"This dress is gorgeous, but i should warn all the tall ladies out there that it fits quite awkwardly. i'm 5'10"" and tried both the petite (thinking it would fall more like a midi), and the regular, hoping it would fit like a maxi should. both hit at a very awkward spot on my mid-shin... as much as i loved and wanted it, it looked too weird to justify buying.",5
"These are the perfect leggings. they're so soft, and they don't stretch and droop throughout a day of wearing them. i ordered the grey and moss, and they have different textures, which is fun.",5
"I never buy anything at retailer full price, but had to get this when i tried it at my local store, especially since it's back ordered for so long. it's very flattering, and super comfortable. fully lined, not see- through at all. elastic waist that's hidden under the sweater top. will be so easy to throw on and dress up for an evening out, or lounge in after a day at the pool or beach. looking at the model pics, i was concerned the arm pit holes came too low, but on me that is not the case. the t",5
This sweater is unique and really pretty.  i got so many compliments and i felt really girlie wearing it - it is so fun.,5
"I just saw this in the store and loved it! it is shorter than pictured on the model, but it's not short. with a long shirt underneath, i'll wear it with leggings. the color is beautiful!! the size does run large - i normally wear a large at retailer, and i got this in a medium. i can't wait to wear it all fall and winter long!",5
"Very fun and comfortable pants that will bring you many compliments. they do fall open when you sit down, though they have liner shorts inside for coverage. they are not appropriate for work but will become a wardrobe favorite.",5
"I don't typically write bad reviews, but this dress is so bad and i want to save someone else from buying it. i read the mostly bad reviews and still purchased anyway (my fault i know). the dress is super stiff ( i know denim can be that way and it is possible it would soften up after a few washes). i'm typically a 6/8 and the size small swallowed me, and the xs was big everywhere except through the bust (i ordered both sizes to try). i wouldn't recommend buying this if you are a size 8 or small",1
"These pants! great casual pants, i've received so many compliments! mainly because they are flowy, and the open panels make them different! with the weather so hot, they are perfect for keeping you cool. very pleased with this purchase!",5
Nice basic top...i will get plenty of use out of this! love the neckline.,5
"I'd been eyeing this dress since i first saw it in the dress catalog when it came out. when i saw it in person, it was just as beautiful as i remembered! i'm about 140 lbs and usually wear a size s or m, but i tried the s on and decided to size down to an xs, because the linen flowy fabric lays a bit wide when on the body; however, the s would have worked, too! i'd say size down if you prefer your clothes a tiny bit more fitted. the fabric is beautiful and lightweight, even though there is more",5
"I have been searching for a pale pink sweater for fall. the color and fit is much prettier than the way it is photographed here. i think it will look great over denim, grey, or olive green dresses and shirts.",5
"I got this in blue and also in white, both size medium. it's a very comfy casual top and i love the horseshoe neckline and front facing seaming which makes it just a bit different. however....i can't figure out why the blue color fits quite a bit smaller than the white. but it does, so consider this when you order, depending upon how you want it to fit. i'm keeping both but will wear the blue in a different way, definitely not with leggings.",5
"I found this at my local store and ended up buying both colors. the fabric is thicker than a t-shirt. these will go with so many things....jeans to dressy skirts. i normally wear a small but ended up buying the medium (2). the small fit me but was a little too short (for reference i am 5'8""). these will be a staple in my wardrobe all year round. love!",5
This sweater has the perfect slouchy shape for fall. i wish it were a little bit softer and heavier - the fabric is pretty lightweight - but it layers beautifully and will be a staple for me this season.,5
"Marking down one star because these pants do gape quite a bit when you sit down, though i appreciate the shorts underneath that prevent any indecent exposure. these could have done with a little stitch in the front or side somewhere on the leg to limit that. that said, my other similar (non-retailer) pants that are much worse and are also are bulkier on top, which does not look great at my size/with my body shape. these are more flattering (i love the band on top) and comfortable. i am normally a",5
"It is seldom that i write a review about a tee, but after receiving the jessa tee in the mail today, i just felt compelled to do so! the deal is, this tee is pricey for sure, but in my opinion, it is worth it! as another reviewer said, the cotton fabric is hefty; in fact, it could also be called a ""lightweight sweater."" everything about this tee is perfect and classic: the elbow sleeves, the nice neckline, and the semi-boxy, semi-cropped fit. it will go with everything from jeans, to nice slacks",5
These leggings are some of the softest i own. i ordered both the black and the moss and each has a distinct pattern. they are perfect for colder climates and fit me like a glove.,5
"So comfy and stylish. love the color, i purchased the indigo/blue. nice fit, relaxed fit....not fitted. might have to get another color. it's fun to have a tee with a different design detail (neckline). i'm 5'7 145-150 lbs and ordered the medium. a smaill probably would have worked too, since my shoulders are a bit narrow. but mediumd is fine:)",5
"I love this sweater! it is true to size and not itchy at all. i am 5'5"" and i bought the small. other reviews said it wasn't as long as it looks pictures but it is the same length on me as it shows on the model. you can wear this with so many things! i can't wait for fall so i can wear it.",5
"The coral is stunning. the shirt has a slight flare at the bottom that you can't see in the picture, it isn't a straight cut. the sewn edges are rough style making the shirt right for casual wear with jeans, or dressing down something fancier.",5
"I received this sweater in last week, when i opened the package i thought for sure that this sweater was going to be itchy , it is not , the styling is great and very flattering for the price this is a great value.",5
"I'm a 110 lb, shorty with a short torso and long arms so the standard xs was huge. i had the opportunity to try on both the xxs petite and xs petite. the xxs petite was almost perfect but i wanted it more flowy - probably best for those that are even shorter and more lightweight than me, othewise, it looks a little too boxy. the petite xs fit me the best and draped nicely, similar to the model in the pink. i had a sweater with this exact silhouette 5+ years ago and wore it to death even though i",5
"I bought it in the cream color and loved it so much that i bought it in black too. super cute with jeans! can dress it up too. the only slight negative, if i had to find one, is that i feel like i have to pull it forward, at the neckline every once in a while...it doesn't choke me but just feels like it's heavier in the back so pulls a bit. worth it though! :)",5
This sweater is like a giant hug. i wore it today and received so many compliments.,5
"This is a perfect saturday t shirt for the colder days. great fit; not form fitting with no elastic or rayon, soft cotton with great details. im 5'8 140 ish and the medium fit great. i bought a washed denimy blue in the store but may be coming back for more colors now! the white was to sheer for my taste though",5
"I can never resist a peter pan collar, so i bought this top in the ivory. it's so cute! i wore it for the first time today and received many compliments. it's very comfortable, fits well, and looks expensive. highly recommend it!",5
"This is absolutely adorable and so flattering! i have the patterned shirt, and i just purchased the white one and the orange one because i like it so much. i am 5 ft. 9"" and 155 lbs. and the medium fits nicely. hope this helps!",5
"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"" and it fits me exactly like the model in the picture. i have slim hips and waist, so that helps. i don't think this would be as flattering on someone curvy. i wish it came in another color i like, i would absolutely buy in another color. i got a medium and it fits like a glove.",5
I bought this a little ago in the denim color. it has become a favorite so much that i bought another in white.,5
I was not impressed with this dress online but when i tried it on at the store i fell in love. it's a great summer / fall dress. i love the sweater top and linen bottom. so many compliments on it!,5
"I needed a tee refresher, i had a good feeling about this one so ordered all three colors when they were on a promo, and i'm not disappointed. the neckline is different and works great to emphasize your favorite necklace. the tee holds shape after washing and drying. my favorite is the blue which i like to wear with dark wash jeans as styled on the model. the white has a cream tinge to it and i'm able to wear it with a nude bra without looking indecent. there is a cute little button detail at th",5
"I found this sweater to fit me just as pictured. i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. it hits length wise the same as pictured and is just as flowy with a lot of fabric. super cute with a grey top, white skinnys and brown leather sandals. love it!",5
"This dress is everything. i'm 5'4, athletic build, 36d and the medium fit me perfectly. the colors are really understated and beautiful and can easily be dressed up or down. i wish the elastic around the waist fell a little lower but that's one of those things only i notice and definitely didn't keep me from falling in love and buying it. can't wait to wear it on vacation next week!",5
I love this cardigan! i ordered the pink and it's a really pretty color. i wish it didn't run so big but xs will be cozy all winter.,5
"Yikes!  quite a smell off of this one- like wet/hot wool.  the color was beautiful, but the sweater is enormous!  strange fit under the arms as well.  this one went back the same day.",1
"This sweater tee is made from a fine but substantial knit which hangs beautifully and flows over imperfections in your figure. the cut is very 1950's through the sleeves and neckline. it's a little cropped and boxy, just so that it hides your belly and accentuates your hips. it looks phenomenal with a crinolined a-line skirt.",5
"This top has a comfy cozy feel while still being flattering. i especially like the generous neckline--adds a uniqueness to it. great shirt for dressing down, but still feeling feminine. i bought two! my husband always compliments me when i wear it.",5
"I love this sweater. it has quickly become a staple in my wardrobe. i live in minnesota, so a fashionable throw-on-and-go sweater is essential. this sweater fits the bill. i love how soft and warm it is, the cocoon styling adds a fashionable element while the acrylic/nylon/wool material keep it functional (warm and cozy). i love anything with pockets, which this has. i somewhat disagree with the other reviewers who say this runs small or short. i did not find that to be true for me, and i ordere",5
"Can be a bit itchy sometimes, i guess depending on your skin. haven't had a problem with the sweater up to now!",5
"This dress is perfect. i'm literally wearing it right now. it's crazy comfortable while still being flattering. it looks and feels high quality, and just barely doesn't hit the floor. it makes me feel like a goddess. plenty of room in the bust area, even for me (36dd), and doesn't show bra straps or underwear. highly recommended!",5
I love this shirt. it would be a fairly basic tee but the neckline makes it fun. it's very soft and comfortable. i bought the white with blue pattern and will probably purchase additional colors.,5
I love this shirt. the neckline is flattering and the overall feel is very comfy.,5
"I wasn't going to purchase this dress because it was given 1 star. however, i ordered it and i was so glad i did!!! i'm 5'1, 105lbs this dress fit me perfectly, it really compliment my petite body. i get so much compliments! it is not easy to order anything for a petite frame but this dress really show off my body without showing too much.",5
I tried this on in the store and had to have it. this is the kind of sweater that you just want to cozy up with on a nice fall or winter day with a cup of coffee in hand. i love the neutral pink color as it will go with everything. i'm a dress and skirt girl and this will go well with those items. it will cover your bum and i love the dolman sleeves. i highly recommend it!!,5
"Bought this today - cant speak to wear - but overall design is so incredibly cute and flattering. i am usually a small or medium, but went with a medium. so different and wearable! white is sheer so opted for a denimy blue color that i dont see listed available online.",5
"I love these tights so much i almost want to buy another few pair and save them for when these wear out. the lining is like clouds on your calves. they're thick enough that you don't need to be totally covered by a tunic but slim enough that they don't add bulk. love, love them!",5
The fit is not as shown on the website. will be returning.,1
There's are just what i was looking for! these are perfect in texture and thickness...not too thick but not too thin. super soft fleece on the inside. i both both the black and green...i will most likely but the grey soon enough.,5
"Adorable, comfortable dress. the denim is super soft with a bit of stretch. please be advised this dress runs very large, especially through the hips. i normally wear a size 12 and the large was swimming on me. i will definitely be exchanging it for a smaller size.",5
"I am long waisted and 5' 120 lbs. 34c. that being said, i purchased a size s regular and it fit perfectly. a petite would have been far too short. so i would recommend a regular size if you're a petite. also i have a big chest and this was very flattering. because of my chest size i usually do best with a v neck, but this classic peter pan collar looks great! i purchased the black. i agree with one of the reviewers who said that the nude color looked like a mess of a weave. the black and white o",5
"This is a bit pricey, but it's the most beautiful sweater that i own. it fits beautifully, and the material is soft, not itchy, which is important for a sweater with a cowl neck. the cowl sits beautifully, no matter how you ""fold"" it. and, the pattern both at the neck and the bottom is vibrant and bright, and is just lovely. i ordered a small and it covers my butt, which is perfect for leggings, or even with tights and boots. it's not shapeless, but seems to graze your thighs, and has a mild tur",5

"I bought this a month ago and returned it. but kept thinking about it so ordered it. it arrived on wed and i wore it on thursday as a dress with tights. i got so many compliments on it. it was perfect for the cool weather and was not too warm.

this knitter thinks the quality of the jacquard knit is excellent. yarn used is top notch.",5
I am six feet tall so this will definitely be a tunic with jeans or leggings but if you are shorter it could easily be a dress. lovely pattern with soft cozy fabric. nice weight and hangs well. definitely a keeper!,5
"I was so excited to order this sweater but was so disappointed when it came. the knit is somewhat stiff and the sleeves are not as bell shaped as pictured on the model. overall i would of kept it if it were much less money, for the price it is just an ordinary sweater with no style.",1
"I absolutely love this sweater! first of all, it's extremely comfortable. i have been wearing it around the house all day and have no desire to take it off. it's cute as a casual around the house top, but also adorable dressed up with jeans and boots. it drapes beautifully for an effortless chic look. the color is pretty close to the photo and very nice in person. the possibilities are endless for colors to accessorize and match with. this sweater is definitely cropped in length, which i normall",5

"I saw this dress in the window at the portland store, and had to try it on. i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it on--sort of like wearing a tent. no shape at all. one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt, and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress i've ever had on. it's romantic, elegant, feminine... the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic. i can't say enough about how amazing it makes me feel. i wore",5
"This sweater was a big let down. i am 5'2"" so i ordered it in a petite. it was so short that if i lifted my arms, you'd see my bra!! there is no way i could wear it without something under it- even with high waisted bottoms. and the bell sleeves look nothing like the pic. the entire sleeve is just wide, and it continues with little increase into the cuff. it is just short and boxy. it is going back for sure.",1
"Love this blouse! the top is true to size...i'm generally a m and decided to try a pl which fit great. the pm was just a bit snug...looked fine but i felt a little constricted in the bust area and thought the pl was better for me. i'm 5'1"" for reference and curvier on top than on bottom. i wore a nude bra when trying on and it totally worked with this blouse. the lace detail is a bit sheer in some parts near the bust line but nothing too inappropriate. i can't wait to wear it down to dinner for",5
"This is a beautiful and fashionable blouse. it feels good on as it is made of viscose, it is pretty and feminine. color is great, of course it needs to be your color. i love it and recommend it!!",5
"This dress is light, airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan. 
this dress is a keeper!",5
Great tank to wear to work or a night out. fits true to size.,5
"Stylist at my local retailer recommended i try on this top. as soon as i put it on, i was amazed at how pretty it is. i'm 5'3"" and curvy size medium and the fit is true to size. i would say if you are between sizes, you may want to size down. i didn't have any issues with the lace and the slight v-neck falls perfectly on me. no need to wear any cami. 
my only concern was how wrinkled the top was. i requested to have the blouse steamed before i left the store so that i could see if all of the wrin",5
"Not only a beautiful knit but can be worn as both tunic and dress on my short frame. it does not look like a sack tent when worn. very soft and flattering. collar is styled well and can be shaped different ways. pattern and color combo is the similar to the exquisite eira dress. i am 5'3"" and i chose the regular over petite. i only wish the sleeves were longer.",5
"As others have said, this is even prettier in person. beautifully made, colors are really pretty. it's unique and special. in sweaters i go between sizes small and medium, depending on the cut. i went with the small here because the medium had a bit too much fabric around the hips where i don't need it. it doesn't run large, it's just that i wanted it to be closer fit as i'll wear it with skinny jeans or leggings.",5
"I love this top! the sizing was great, and i have already worn it so many times, and received so many compliments! it is great to dress up or down! such a great purchase!",5
Purchased in the blue. the color is a little darker than it shows. more of a slate blue. loved the fit. i am tall so it covered perfectly.,5
"Very slimming, lovely dress.
a nice addition to your fall/ winter wardrobe.
the embroidery is lovely, fabric soft and comfortable. sized perfectly. 
so happy with this beautiful black dress!!!",5
"New fav lbd. i am 5 months postpartum and this dress makes me feel like my old self again. it fits right above the waist, with a bow to cinch the waist. love the fit and flare. the top is warm, great for a cold evening out. and the taffeta really dresses it up. love",5
"After reading the reviews, i was hesitant to purchase, but glad i did. i'm usually an xs or s depending on the brand, but i got this in a xxs. it fits perfectly and is so cute. does not look like a bathrobe at all. i love it because it's almost like a cardigan blazer...looks like a blazer but feels like a cardigan!",5
"Comfortable,t eh fabric is very soft. the embroidery adds a little to the otherwise plain black tunic. lace up neck on trend too. 

i ordered the xxs p, as it is likely loose... that was just fine for me, xs p would have been not as flattering. theo nly problem with that is the sleeves then became a little more snug (workout arms). not too snug that i can't wear the dress, but decided not to keep it only because there are way too many things i like at retailer! (and have to pick). in my wish lis",5
I bought this in black and it did require me to wear a shirt underneath as it was a little sheer/see through. i usually wear an xs and i wore the same in this top. the black is very pretty and goes well with some skinny jeans.,5
"This tunic is very pretty in black. it is lighter weight than the picture appears and drapes nicely. i'm 5'2 so i ordered the petite, but would have been ok with the extra length of the regular for when worn with leggings, with jeans the petite length will work well. i recommend using the size chart provided. i general wear an xs, but ordered the s, based on the size chart, it's a perfect fit.",5
It is so simple but elegant and beautiful! i am 5'3 and 120 lb and extra small fits me perfectly,5
"I love this shirtdress. the lace and collar design pops off the black. super comfortable and love that it has pockets! a keeper, this one not going back ever. i am 5'9 and 140 lbs and the 6 fits perfect. the length comes above my knee, so most likely i will be wearing tights or skinny's underneath.",5
"I love the soft, slouchy feel of this draped yet constructed jacket. don't expect a crisp fit. i'm not a fan of the menswear look so this jacket is the boho answer to a classic blazer. the one-button closure is easy to wear; the hem curves for a more feminine look. i hesitated before ordering (hoping it would turn up at my local retailer). by the time i was ready to order, the green version had sold out. as it turns out, the copper is even better. it was 86 degrees today, but i wore it anyway!",5
Unusual color. expensive even on sale.,5
"I am 5'4"" 140 pounds and ordered the 8 petite. it fits perfectly and is very flattering. the embroidery and lace up neckline thing is really awesome. it gives the dress some character... i am also a fan of the roll-up sleeves. i wish it came in other colors because i would certainly order more than one. the one and only potentially negative aspect, and i say potential because i'm not sure if its an issue or not as i haven't worn/washed it yet is it appears to be something that i may have to iron",5
"Oh elevenses, i love your pants..the fabrics, the details, the length. i've found elevenses to be classic work pants. reliable, professional, well made. these are none of those things. the cardinal trousers are thin and the rise feels much higher that's it appears in the picture. the red pair are thin, stretchy and cheap. both pairs have to go back. i'm truly sad.",1
The lokka tunic is a perfect go-to top for casual days or nights! pair it with skinny jeans or leggings and you are set! the long sleeves are fitted and long-so they can be bunched at the wrist. i ordered it in both the black and the the pale grey/blue shade. it is a winner.,5
"I got two of these when they went on sale because i hate paying $68 for a basic top like this.. but for the sale price they are great! comfortable, lightweight, and flattering. the black is a little sheer, but nothing a tank underneath can't solve. a good buy!",5
"I bought this in my usual medium and it fits great (fitted at the shoulder, loose below). it looks great with skinny jeans and can be worn casually or dressed up with accessories.",5
"Ordered this dress online and wasn't sure about the criss-cross neckline feature but i love it! it's absolutely adorable and unbelievably comfortable. the fabric is very soft and lays nicely without feeling too ""baggy"" or frumpy. the embroidery is beautiful. i'm wearing it to a fall event in october and pairing it with my favorite cowboy boots, but it would also look great with flats, heels or booties. totally in love with this dress!",5
"I was not shopping for a dress and somehow came home with this. in person the material and embroidery are just so stunning that i found myself picking it up. i was sold after trying it on. the material is very soft, both feels and looks extremely high quality. and for a basic shirtdress, it is amazingly flattering. follows curves without clinging to them. i'm 5'4"", 123 lbs, usually wear a small in tops/dresses & purchased the size 4, which fit perfectly. i'm slightly chesty (34d) so sometimes ha",5
"Love this dress! it is super-flattering, and the embroidery is beautiful.",5
"I am going to disagree with reviewers who say this runs small. i found it very short and wide. that being said, it is meant to be cropped. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly, albeit a little short. for reference, i am usually a size 6/medium in retailer shirts and dresses.",5
"Absolutely gorgeous skirt! so feminine and curve hugging. wish i hadn't found this so late! want it in every imaginable color, but i will settle for the off white.

please bring this style back!",5
Great style!,5
"This top is great - lightweight and flattering.
i can wear it to work with skinny white pants or to the grocery store with jeans. 
i purchased another color because i love the first i got so much.",5
"Can be dressed up or down. the top part is tight, while the bottom has a beautiful skirt. i'm slightly busty and about 5'6"" and the size 6 is perfect for me.",5
"Love this shirt! i bought the light blue color and its amazing, fits well i love that its long in the back. very comfortable and loose. thinking of buying it in both pinks.",5
Love this cardigan. fits just as i expected. very structured in the front with a bit of flair in the back.,5
"This is a pretty sweater. i ordered the red and it is a plum color, not close to red, but it will work well with black, gray and denim. i found the sweater looks boxy from the front but the back is spectacular. it is very well made. no raw edges or seams that are threatening to unravel. this will be nice for casual holiday dressing. i found a longer tank in white works well under this.",5
"I bought this tunic in black and am seriously considering buying it in more colors. it is so comfortable and very flattering. i am 5'11"", so many tunics are more like shirts on me, but this one is the perfect length to wear with leggings or pants. the v neck is a nice, feminine touch and i love the change in material around the edges.",5
"I am 5 feet and 120. i ordered a petite small in moss. i have posted a photo below. it's a pretty green. the lining is pretty. the reason i deducted a star is because the lining is very thin and ""slips"" a little when putting the jacket on. but it doesn't effect the way the jacket falls and i wear it comfortably. it's floppy, but not sloppy. i was surprised that each side the fabric is like a tulip. it was a nice surprise. i'm curvy and busty. i have zero problem with it being unflattering. the s",5
"These leggings are soft, comfortable and go with everything. love the way they feel.",5
"I read the reviews prior to purchasing but loved the pattern so much i had to have it. i was not disappointed however, had i not read the reviews i would have been. it is true the top of the dress is flat and does not have the detail as shown on the model. it also appears to be disproportionate. i am 5'1 and curvy the bottom fits well but the top is large however rectified by wearing a padded bra. since i ordered the petite i was surprised the dress was above the ankle (usually their items are l",5
This is more beautiful in person. i love the detail and color. i usually don't like ponchos but this one's shape with the square front definitely sets this apart.,5
I rarely write reviews but had to comment on these pants. these pilcro pants are my favorite for the fall and winter. they fit beautifully and are a great alternative to jeans. the pants are so comfortable and flattering. love the print and they are so versatile as they can be worn as very casual pants and can be dressed up. i am in my 60's and am always looking for clothes that are stylish without being too young looking for a woman my age. retailer is my favorite store!,5
"I ordered these in both the grey and moss, and i love both. they are very soft, very easy, loose fitting casual shorts. i wear them a bit lower on my waist than pictured, so they hit lower on my leg than on the model, which i prefer in these. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered xs. the dark grey ones feel more versatile, like you could throw on anything with them and go. the moss look cute with white/cream summery tops. they washed well (machine, cold, laid flat to dry), touched up with light steam from",5
"Love these pants. corduroy leggings that fit like a skinny pant. comfortable. not too stretchy. maintains shape, even with multiple wears between cleaning. pairs nicely with black, neutral, or buttery yellow tops. fun print. received compliments first time i wore them. sizing is just right also. i'm 5'3. usually wear 26 in denim but have to go up a size for super skinny so i ordered a 27p which fits me just fine.",5
"These cords are seriously fantastic. worth the price indeed. they are very comfy, have a lot of stretch but do not loose shape! the fun yet muted color design allows an average outfit to have a fun pop. they do run big, i got a 26 and i'm usually a 27. they are also very long! nothing a little trip to tailors can't fix. overall, highly recommended.",5
"I loved the photo of this dress. upon examination of the dress (and trying it on) after receiving in the mail, the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern. the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top. the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo. turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear.",1
"Beautiful pajama bottoms. i purchased these as a special treat for myself. luckily, i found a review on another site, stating that these run small, before pirchasing. no one wants tight pjs. order a size up! also, i'm 5'8"" tall and the length is just right. if you are taller, you may find this style too short. i haven't ordered the top, because i'm not sure of the fit, but i'm guessing it also runs small, based on the photo.",5
I bought this top in my usual size in a small. i'm a 34 d 26 waist. i absolutely love it. i pair it with a red cardigan. very cute.,5
"I love this sweater combo! as a larger woman, i am always looking for flattering tops. the draping in front covers all the right areas! i wish they made them in more colors!",5
This is a perfect fit! i was worried that it would be too short and or boxy. i usually  wear an xs. i have a slightly longer waist though and often xs tops run short or they are overwhelming! this was perfect! it is roomy and long enough without swallowing my frame. it looks nice enough to dress up and wear out and about. great value at the sale price as well!! it is well made and doesn't just look like a run of the mill pullover.,5
"When i saw this online, i thought it was going to be a thin, summery kind of skirt with a fall pattern to it. it is not thin and wispy, but lined with a nicely weighted navy material and the fabric of the skirt is kind of a thick cotton with a nice swing to it. definitely would work for the fall and cool days or evenings. the zipper pockets look cool too, would definitely recommend!",5
"I was excited to see these jeans since they came in petite sizes and had a short inseam... unfortunately after ordering/returning several pairs, i found out that these are actually not petite jeans. please beware that if you are ordering these for the shorter inseam, they are actually 28 in... not 24 in as in the description. other than the inseam issues, they fit like typical paige denim.",1
This is a great skirt that could be worn to a wedding or worn more casually with a cool tshirt. it is not too puffy and the inner skirt is stretchy and more fitted. i had to size 1 size down. really nice.,5
"Wow, i can't believe there were some sizes left at my local store. it was on sale and i maxed out with additional discount for black friday week-end. the size 6 fit perfect and i can't wait to wear. this is a gorgeous skirt and will sell out for sure.",5
"I love the fabric, since it's fall wasn't expecting it to be light. but its not heavy either. just the right balance.
this is one of those classics. i love the collage like pattern of the fabric.
the fit is true to size and looks great with bootie/boots. (dressed up or down).",5
"This is one of those 'i need one in every color' kind of shirts. need - not simply want. it is very well constructed. the fabric is the perfect weight and is sooooooo comfortable. the raspberry is a little more dusty rose than pictured online, but it works. i've only had the shirt a couple of day. in addition to wanting to wear it every day, the fabric has not pilled. i'm short-waisted, and i have not had any issue with the high-low hem or cropped length.",5
"This was on display when walked into my local retailer, it's just a beautiful in person. my mistake was trying it on, instant love! i tried on my usual size small & it fit perfectly. i would usually wait for something in this price range to go on sale, but i just had to have this. worth the splurge!",5
"These are the best fitting jeans i've ever owned! no puckering near the crotch, and i don't need to have the waistband taken in. they probably run small.",5
"This dress is so beautiful, the color is even more vibrant in person, a stunning emerald green. it is well made and doesn't go too low under your arm, which sometimes happens with halters. the halter material is a thicker band that gives nice support. the skirt does a little poof near your hips at the top, look at the back view photo online, you can see it there. at first i was surprised by it because i didn't see that on the front view, but then i decided it was fun and flirty. i received numer",5
"These pants are perfect!!! they are exactly what i was looking for, and worth every penny! the fabric is more lightweight than any other sort of denim, but still i think i could wear these any season. they look so cute with simple heels and a classic blouse, but they can be dressed down with nice sneakers and a plain white t! so excited to have these in my closet!! love a good pair of fun pants.",5
"This top will be perfect for autumn and even winter down in the southeast. i purchased the ""red"" and hoped that it was more of a rust color-lucked in! the material is very soft and more on the thinner side for layering-which is alway a plus. i have spare tires in my belly area and this does not grab aholed of them,in fact the stripes do the work and disguise! and the lace up nautical feel brings the attention to my money maker! you won't be disappointed",5
"I ordered this on a whim during retailer days sale and i'm glad i did. it's now one of those shirts that calls my name every morning. i've worn it with denim skinnies and a knee length black knit pencil skirt. so soft and flattering. i got it in the red, but am tempted by the blue!",5
"These pants are 100% true to size (whatever that means anymore...i'm a 26 in paige and ag.  i'm 5''6, weigh around 115, have long legs and i ordered the 0p.  the zero petite are still a little long, with a slight heel they're perfect.  they don't have stretch in them, but do to the fit and fabric...the material does expand, because they're thin and breezy.  i absolutely love them.  can't wait to order other colors of the same style.  these are my new favorite pants.",5
"I ordered this skirt online in a size 8 but returned for a 10 so it could sit a bit lower.

the fabric is so beautiful and a bit heavier so it can be worn all year long.
so glad i made this purchase.",5
"Don't pay attention to the less-than-flattering photo. these jeans are super cute and very flattering. they are actually long, not ankle length as the photo implies. high waisted with a 70s bell bottom vibe. nice light denim for year round wear. they fit like a dream.",5
"I got this skirt in the dove grey, which is a lovely shade of light grey and silver. it has one layer underneath that is a sparkly silver netting which is really pretty that you can't see in the photo. the other layer is the grey netting. it has a very soft light grey silky cotton liner. i got the petite xs and it fits just as it should. i'm 5'3, 102. the skirt looks just as it is pictured, i think it can be dressy or dressed down a bit. very very pretty and well made. i'm happy with the purchas",5
"Really loved this - so soft and snuggly. was unsure about ordering shirt size - (s) or jacket size for layering (m). ordered a small. fits perfect! definitely wouldn't have wanted the medium. 5'4, 135 lbs for reference. love this one!!! great find.",5
"Love these jeans! they are the perfect relaxed fit; not too baggy, and a straight style. i did size down, because i wanted to wear them as shown. i was afraid that they would ride too low on my hips. glad i did! i usually wear size 29/6 and took a 28 in this pair. the color and denim weight is also great.",5
I ordered this dress for my daughter. she wore it to a wedding and it was beautiful. looks just as it does in photo. fabric is a nice weight and hangs great. my daughter had her hair done and look right out of an retailer catalog. well made true to size beautiful dress!!!!!!!,5
"Layered this with a chunky sweater and a pair of kicks. it can be low key or dressed up with a pair of heels, multi-functionality not just occasional. it&#39;s feminine, funky, and fabulous!! i bought the last one in the store!",5
"The colors are richer than shown- very vibrant. this piece is very unique and everthing that i love about retailer! i usually wear a medium in jackets and vest. i tried the small and there was very little difference from the small or the medium fit, so i went a size up, just for a looser look. it is very flattering and will be a great addition to my fall wardrobe!",5
An interesting design in a high-quality garment.  fits true to size on me and is great for layering.  very soft knit with the drapey attachment and a collar you can adjust to look the way you want. i feel lucky that i got this on sale but i would've gladly paid full price since this is a three season piece.,5
"I bought this tee in all 3 colors, and wish there were more!  fabulous quality, material and style.  can dress up or down; wear with jeans, pants or skirts.  wear alone or layer.  don't miss out on this addition to your wardrobe!",5
"I'm very short and thus not usually into maxi skirts since most of them make me look frumpy, but i ordered this skirt based upon all the great reviews. this skirt is more amazing in person. at first, the material feels a bit stiff and the gold is a lot more shiny in person. but, as usual, moulinette knows how to put things together. when worn, everything comes together, the pleats and the length flow beautifully and the gold shimmers in a subtle way. the skirt runs large (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 h",5
"Sits at waist, length is perfect for petite, quality is very good, looks very nice on me, very recommend",5
"Cute jeans! flattering and slimming. tts. the cut of the top makes my butt look flat, but oh well, they are super comfy. they are not as short on me as they look on the model. i'm 5;9""",5
"Love it! the pants is absolutely beautiful, rich material, it's not your cheap jogger!
i am really considering buying a second pair just in case i used my a little to much.
fits perfect, i am 5'4"" 114lbs and purchase the regular small.",5
Purchased these jeans in a 27 and i am usually a 28 in skinny jeans. i got the 26's on but they were snug. these jeans are so comfy and sit higher on the waist. great jeans!,5
"I purchased the coral version, and the color is wonderful and vibrant. it fit my daughter beautifully, and she is 5'10"". i think she will be wearing this coat often, she loves it!!! she is 23 years old and has a professional job, so she will look the part.",5
"I'm in love, i'm in love.

this dress was gifted to me, because i was gawking at it so often. i love it!!! i am petite, 5'3"" 118 pounds and i could do either the small or extra small. the small was a little more comfortable, because the extra small was a bit tight in the arms-but i went with the extra small anyway. in both cases the neckline showed a small amount of tasteful cleavage and i felt like a model with how many people complimented me on it. many people even took the extra step in compl",5
"Very comfortable dress, with a gorgeous pattern. it comes with a self liner in navy that is very smoothing - i was worried a figure hugging sweater knit would be unflattering. cut is perfect. i'm a size 10/12 on top and 12/14 on bottom, and the m was the best fit. the neckline is a deep scoop so if you are not busty it may come down too far for comfort.",5
"I love this skirt. i was happy with the quality of the fabric and style. i originally ordered a small, but returned and exchanged for a medium, which fits great. (i typically wear a size 6-8 in pants). i look forward to wearing this skirt to work this fall.",5
"These are both adorable and practical?they're versatile enough to dress up or down, and they are just warm enough for fall temperatures. these will definitely be my go-to tights this season.",5
This is an absolutely gorgeous dress that stands out everywhere i go. it runs true to size and has a slimming effect because of the detail running down the sides.,5
"First, i've been in love with this dress for months. when it went on sale i absolutely had to have it! i'm 5'4"" and 150 pounds and typically wear large stuff from retailer but after reading other reviews i decided to get the medium. it's more generous than i expected and wonder if i could've even gone with a small. i might try a belt. either way i'm very very happy with the dress. the sleeves are not too long - and i didn't get the petite because i wanted the length in the skirt. the lining makes",5
"The sweater coat is a must try on! it's a great fall to winter coat, that you can leave on all day if you need. i bought the dark green, which is very dark yet gorgeous and have the beautiful coral saved in my cart as well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, ordered the size small and have plenty of room (did not want it tight and wanted to be able to wear over thick layers).",5
"Just purchased this coral coat today. the color is beautiful. the quality is excellent and the coat itself is lightweight,great for travel. great purchase and would recommend buying. going to new york and can't wait to wear it . love, love this coat",5

"Saw this in store in coral color and new i had to try. love. it's the perfect, cozy cute sweater, color is beautiful and fit is great. i am 5 5"" 135 lbs and i tried both the small and extra small. i went with the xs for a more flattering fit. i love it.",5
"I really did not need another coat at all, but i couldn't resist. got it in green - it's dark and woodsy,something robin hood and his merry men could wear in the forest to look and feel their most stylish. the structure is just right - this coat is soft, cozy and fluid, but also tailored enough to wear in a business casual environment... equally well-suited to wear on winter eve dog walks, to a football game, or at the coffee shop for a latte at an outside table. works with most of my wardrobe -",5
"It pills a little under the arms and picks up lint, but it's totally worth it. this is a fabulous sweater coat. i receive compliments on it wherever i go. so cozy, warm & delicious. not too hot to wear indoors either. it's breathable. love it. bought in green during black friday sale. highly recommend.",5
"Omg - wish it came in more colors,,",5
"This dress has a beautiful fit; eyed it for awhile--snatched it up at the dress sale! only drawback was the edging around the neck; on some, the cream-patterned fabric was used and it was distracting. hunted around at stores, but ended up getting lucky with online purchase.",5
Absolutely beautiful. as soon as i saw the color i had to have it. looks great. i am 5 ft 2 in the color is beautiful. excellently made. very comfy. hood is not bulky,5
Very cheap looking material. looks cheap to cost $158.,1
I've been a fan of the pilcro chinos for years but the jeans have not been the right fit for me - usually wind up too big in the waist to accommodate the hips. well the em is aptly named as they are made to fit a girl! ! i usually wear a 29 and the 29 fit comfortably and i could probably even go down a size. thank you retailer - please make more in this style!,5
"What a well-designed dress! the cut is a slight a-line without adding bulk and the pattern is very slimming. the lining makes this a pretty good option for cooler weather. the neck is pretty wide, as others have noted, but i find that a heavy cream colored scarf is a pretty good accent. it does run a little large. i'm 5'5""/130lbs and went with the xsp.",5
I was initially attracted to the colors,5
"I tried this dress on in the store and ended up ordering it online during the dress sale. it is extremely flattering and really accentuates the waist. it is very comfortable, and made of a nice, soft fabric. i am a 34a and it just barely reveals a tiny bit of cleavage so i don't find the neckline too low. i plan to wear it with tights and booties. i am 5' 4"" and the regular xs comes to a bit below my knees. going to enjoy wearing this lovely dress!",5
This is way cuter in person than on model. it is a super soft and fluffy sweater. the colors are so pretty and feminine. i received it as a christmas gift and have already worn it twice. it's perfect with skinny jeans and ugg boots. i vary between xs and small in retailer sweaters. this is a bit boxy so i sized down with the xs and it fits perfect!,5
"I adore this hooded boiled wool sweatercoat in rich, deep green. quality is great aside from the buttons being sawn on very loosely. it's a great outer layer in the warm northern california fall/winter. i'm wearing it today with a short sleeved boiled wool dress in burgundy for pre-christmas eve cocktails and feeling classy, festive, cozy, and warm.",5
"Every year i'm excited when the weather gets cool enough for sweater dresses. i love this one, with the longer length, slimming fit and pattern placement, and cozy soft fabric. delightful, inspires reveries of castles and legends (yes i looked up what ""eira"" stands for and went with it). highly recommended. fit is generously tts.",5
"I adore this sweater coat! i first bought the green color in my normal size online on a whim mostly due to the positive reviews. i was not disappointed at all! this sweater coat is soft boiled wool.. the green color is a deep forest that looks incredible with black, grays and berry colors.

the fit appears to be magical. it manages to be both roomy and figure flattering, which is tricky with my figure (hourglass). i tend to need a defined waist, but somehow this coat manages to be very slimming",5
"This sweater dress is lovely, quirky and comfortable. because i have broader shoulders, the neckline was perfect on me, although i probably will end up wearing a scarf to keep my neck warm! the dress skims in a very flattering way. at first i was dissapointed it wasn't more formfitting, but it drapes very nicely. (i usually wear a size four in dresses and chose the small in this dress which was best i think.) it has a built in slip that is a bit flimsy, so i will probably wear a long silk one th",5
Cute and comfortable! i loved the colors and how soft the shirt is!,5
So different than anything in my closet. it's wide with a beautiful drape. fabric is soft but substantial. it has the cutest coral color lining the placket and inside of the lower sleeves. i sized down to a medium and could have gone to a small but i love the length and drape which might not translate in fit in the smaller size. so cute on.,5
"This jacket is worth every penny! it is light enough to wear when like 55/60 out or good when it is in the 40s with a sweater underneath. the fit and design of the coat is amazing! i love the full collar look - that's my favorite detail of the jacket. loved the green so much, i bought the coral too! i normally wear a 12/14 in clothes and the large was perfect!",5
"I ordered this coat in the ""pink"" color. actually, it is a coal color (papaya) and will be wonderful with gray, black, khaki, and great with animal print accessories. the fit is just as it looks online, no surprises. this coat is attractive buttoned or unbuttoned. the collar is just as attractive buttoned as unbuttoned. the boiled wool is light weight and has some stretch to it. (much softer than the boiled wool geiger jackets, for anyone who remembers them)

one concern: since the wool is light",5
"Here's the thing: this is a sweatercoat. it's not a coat. it's not something i'll be able to wear independently by the end of november, though i'm enjoying doing so now. it's boiled wool, and not lined, and though it's cozy and warm enough for a morning walk to the train in the high 40s, its role is going to end up being a mid layer. i'm also enjoying wearing it over both dresses and pants at work, serving as a kind of cardigan/blazer combination.
i purchased the pink, which i saw online first a",5

"Every year around this time, our beloved retailer comes out with a wool sweater coat. i've seen every style over the last five years and this year they have outdone themselves!!! this coat is a dream. not too thin and not too thick...it's the perfect layering piece. the fabric has perfect stretch in it. the colors are lovely (i ended up with the cream color, but i loved the green too!!) in many sweater coats i prefer an xl, but because of the stretch the l was just perfect. i'm 5'8 and it hits wel",5
"I tried on this sweater in the store and immediately ordered my size. i got the petite small in natural delivered to my door several days later and am extremely pleased. the fit is roomy enough to layer, but not too large or boxy. the wool is fluffy and luxurious and has terrific appeal. i get compliments every time i wear it...""classic,"" ""fancy,"" ""jackie o."" are all terms i heard used to describe my favorite new sweater. the coat is made from a medium weight wool and is probably not meant for e",5
Super soft and comfortable. runs a little large. very cozy.,5
Wear the collar down & it favors grace kelly. pull it up and it's an oversized hood. this lightweight cozy piece combines everything i love about a sweater & a coat in one.,5
Warn and super soft. love it !,5
"Love the high waist, prewashed softness, and relaxed fit. i normally wear a 27 in pilcro but sized down to a 26. for the first time in ages i have a pair of jeans that won's slide down because of the high waistline. i would never tuck anything in so it doesn't matter that it's high waisted but i don't have to worry about them sliding down over my muffin top. worth every penny.",5
"I saw this and tried to wait for it to go on sale, but it sold so fast, i wanted the black and i check everyday until they had my size, i love this coat main because of the wait it goes around the neck since i am not a scarf person, this is very cute, im glad i got it, even at the full price.",5
"These joggers are gorgeous--you can even dress them up! the quality and softness is amazing and very expensive looking. the fit is perfect not to mention the fact that they are very flattering.
really, i knew the minute i saw them, i would love them. but, i do have to say that the lovely model
wearing them ---the model with the wine colored shirt and the awesome red bag (i bought that too!!!)and that big smile sold me!. many thanks to retailer--personal stylists carolyn and blair. always so helpfu",5
"I love sweater knit dresses and this the first one i've owned with a flare style that works. pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a non-obvious way. i think the fabric is soft and warm. i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint. you may want to size down if you're not busty. i am 5'3"" and m petite was the perfect length on me. shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in 1.5 days?!?!?!!!",5
"I have this wonderful sweater coat in three sizes (s,sp,m) in the coral, green",5
"Oh my goodness! i just received this coat tonight. i love it! it is beautiful and stylish. i got the green which is amazing. i'm 5'2"" - weigh 115. ordered both s and xs. i'm keeping the s - more room in case a heavier sweater. get this! it's a classic! you will smile!",5
"I wasn't sure what to expect with these pants. i couldn't figure out from the pictures what the material would actually be like. is it jersey? is it french terry? is it more traditional sweatshirt-type material? nope, turns out, they're like wearing pants made out of a fuzzy, flecked sweater. or like the thickest, loosest sweater-knit tights ever. surprise! they are the strangest pants i've ever owned, for sure, but i actually really like them. they're super comfortable and cozy warm. slightly i",5
"This dress hung so nicely on my figure (small up top, bigger in the hips) that i couldn't pass it up. the lines are more flattering in person than in the photos. it might run a little small...i'm normally an extra small, but it was a little snug in the arms. however, the small was too big, so i would suggest sticking with your usual size. the saleslady said would stretch a little. i would have loved to try a petite, but the store didn't carry petite sizes. it will be my go-to holiday dress.",5
Love this as a lightweight coat for cool to cold days. i love the squishy soft feel of the material. it works well with sweaters. love the deep pockets which works with my iphone plus and wallet. i love how simple and practical this coat is. the hood when not used as a hood makes a nice collar for the neck and head.,5
"I have broader shoulders and thick arms, this dress does an amazing job slimming my arms and not making me appear top heavy!
i'm 5'4 125 lbs, the xs fit perfectly",5
This bra is so well made and fits beautifully.,5
"Snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room!!!!! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine!!!! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down. i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame. it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your ""normal"" size. the quality is great and the style is just lovely. great jacket-love love love",5
Love this coat - great fall piece! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture. great retailer purchase!,5
I bought it to mainly wear as a coat but i think it'd be great with some leggings and boots as well. if you want a more structured look go a size smaller. i plan on wearing this more as outer wear so i went with large. the coral is beautiful,5
"The top i received was large, really long in length, pockets in the front along the seam, and lots of volume in the back without any princess seams to give it shape. the id #'s matched, but that's about it. returned!",1
"At first, i thought this sweater might be too boxy, but fastened at the waist, it's very flattering and the collar is face-framing, and the coral in particular (really more of a mango sorbet shade) is unexpected but cheery for winter.

but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets. brought a new puppy home just after christmas, and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats. bought it in coral and pink.",5
"I love this dress. will be wearing it for the first time tomorrow. it fits well. the neck line is a bit low on me. i think it would look best on someone with more of a chest than i have. i will be wearing a winter white infinity scarf with it (as shown on model). i am 5' 6.5"" and 120 lbs and the small is just right.",5
"Love this sweater jacket! super comfortable and warm. i am 5'2 and i got a xs petite. it fit perfectly both in length and in the sleeve. the green color is super rich and is perfect for the season. it's easy to wear it up and wear it down. i appreciate that it's not super bulky, which was what i was afraid of. my favorite jacket of the season so far.",5
Purchased this sweater in the blue color which is a gray/blue. it runs large as the xs is still quite roomy on me in the body. although the arms are more snug. great quality.,5
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my daughter, and i am so glad i did. the colors are beautiful, and the material is so soft. i'm sure she's going to love it!",5
"I fell in love with this top (sweater) before it could even be ordered - was on model for pants that were available to order. in any case, i later ordered the blue motif online and the colors are even more beautiful in person. the blue also contains fibers of wine - so very pretty. the gray is a soft shade. the quality is lovely too. the only cons are that the seater is rather heavy, but should be great for colder winter months and the zipper on the back is quite conspicuous. however, that said,",5
Love the feminine styling of a classic tunic tee! i'll wear it with black leggings this fall. super cute to wear casually or dress up a bit with some jewelry and/or a scarf.,5
"This top is full of amazing details. the photos really don't do it justice. it is very flowy and does run large but is so pretty and soft and in beautiful shades of blue. i bought a small and it is fairly long in back on my 5'5"" frame but because of the detailing...it just works.",5
"Unlike the first three reviews, i loved this sweater. the colors were beautiful and i paired it with green cords. i did not find the sweater to be itchy but very comfortable. fits trus to size.",5
"Great fit even for busty women. ordered an 8 because i usually need the room in the chest area on dresses.(36d-dd) fit nicely without being tight. might have been able to size down but i didn't want to risk being too tight. flattering especially on curves. nice for contemporary office or special occasion. if you like his designs, you won't be disappointed!",5
"Love this top, purchased it in the coral color now i'm definitely wanting it in the blue since it is such a great blouse for transitioning into fall. the weight of the top it good since i live in south texas so definitely needing lightweight long sleeves for our weather. i'm sure when the time comes adding a long cardigan or blazer over it as needed for the cooler weather it will look great. fit true to size.",5
"Absolutely love this suit. the bottoms are very comfortable and covers everything id like it to. it does not ride up at all, which almost never happens with swim suits. i'm going to order this in a different color next season. i paired the bottoms with the peplum top and received many compliments.",5
I just love this dress.  took me ordering a number of sizes- petite and regular to find the best fit.  i might still have the top altered.  i received a lot of compliements.  work it with some black leather wedges for daytime/work.,5
"I got the purple color and absolutely love it. i am 5'2"" but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer. i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm. it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely!",5
Love the color! very soft. unique look. can't wait to wear it this fall,5
"I love this sweater.  i am 5' 1"" and tried on the petite in the store but ended up going with the regular size as i preferred the length.  the overall fit was the same.  i bought the blue which to me is the colour shown here, more a grey and purplish colour, beautiful for fall and much nicer than a straight blue.  i have worn it to work several times and always get a compliment.  this sweater is nice for all ages, it is soft, comfortable and versatile.  it might just be my go to fall sweater.",5
I have the blue color of this top and i love the color variation throughout. it looks very unique and it is going to be a great piece for late summer/early fall. the pleated look on the upper chest is very flattering and adds texture to the top. i am pleased with my purchase!,5
This sweater is perfect for transitioning into fall as it is not too heavy. it's flattering and looks great with jeans.,5
"I'm an xl but ended up buying this in a size large. i am very pleased with the interesting cable pattern that runs down the front. i also really like that this is cotton, and even though it is heavy and substantial, the thread gauge is a fine weight. while this says i can hand wash the sweater, i'm reluctant to because i'm worried that hand washing will end up stretching the sweater out of shape. i don't care for the heavy gold zipper running down from the neck, but my hair hides that. overall,",5
"My perspective is as a sewer so i'm more picky perhaps. this top is poorly made. the fabric pattern is crooked or not consistent in each piece. sewers do this to save $ - squeezing the pieces on the fabric. it looks sloppy. the cut is very full; the bottom edge measures 104"" around. for my figure, curvey, at 5'6"" and 150lbs, this top is not flattering it looks maternity. perhaps best on a slim figure and with leggings.",1
"I got the pink version to layer with spring clothes. i always wear a medium, but sized down to a small based on the other review. the seams are very flattering. the material is very soft. on sale, the price is reasonable.",5
I love this shirt so much i am ordering the coral too! the weight of the material makes it hang nicely. there is a lot of material but it lends itself to the flowy style. i got many compliments of this top!,5
"This sweater is perfect! finally a sweater that doesn't make me look like a huge box!

i bought the blue & it has other colors running through it so i'll be able to wear it with chinos & jeans. very pretty, flattering & i think i'm going to be wearing this a lot.",5
"True to size for petite person; bought in blue - subtle shading, looks great; paired with your blue straight leg blue ""jeans""; perfect outfit for almost all occasions.",5
"Spotted this beauty in my local store - hanging (grrr) which made it stretch out. note that it's made of linen, cotton, and acrylic, so it's not heavy, it's weighty. anyways, it seemed to run large just due to gravity, so i ended up ordering it so it wasn't all stretched out. it's got a beautiful a-line cut - perfect for us bottom-heavy gals. love the colored thread woven throughout. worth the extra $.",5
Okay this shirt is soooo comf. it is super fun and flowy. but it runs large. get one size smaller than you would usually get! so worth the sale price!!!,5
Cute and comfy shirt! tts- got my usual m (i'm a 10) and it has a generous fit but i think it's supposed to. it's actually a silver grey color.,5
"I would highly recommend this top. i usually wear a small petite. but returned the top for an xs petite which fit perfectly. there is a lot of fabric, but if you size down it wasn't an issue for me. i weigh 120lbs and am 5 feet tall. also, i'm busty, 34 d. which worried me with this type of top. not a problem. i will wear a blazer or leather short jacket with this. i am very picky and i was happy with the quality. the fabric is not heavy. it's a fantastic purchase!",5
"I loved this but hesitated to order since i'm petite and busty and assumed it would be an awful mess in the chest area (too tight, gaping etc) but it is great!!! it fits perfectly! there is plenty of room in the chest and the dress is not too long! i ordered a pm and its wonderful. the dress is not see through at all. love it!!!!!",5
"I just saw this vintage style blouse at my local store and tried it and think this blouse is amazingly beautiful! it's actually very well made and a tad heftier than i imagined from the picture. there's different strips of gorgeous lace all over including that amazing lace at the collar and bib, the arm holes are just perfect in my regular size small (34d-27-35) so it runs tts and i didn't find this overly blousy myself though that's just part of its charm. you'll need an undershirt or something",5
"I love this top. the quality is excellent. the blouse is lined and falls nicely.. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans. the color is described as ""orange"", but it really has more of a bronze tone. looks very rich and exotic. it's perfect top when you want to wear jeans, but want to dress it up a bit.",5
"This swimsuit completely exceeded my expectations! 
i'm 5'2"", 140 lbs with an athletic build, and the cut of this swimsuit is ultra slimming! with the way the top wraps it makes my torso look much longer and leaner than it actually is :) i bought the top in a small and the matching bottoms in medium. 

the material is thick, high quality, and the colors are exactly the way they appear online. 
the top is reversible and the alternate side is teal and nude. i feel like i got 4 tops in one sinc",5
"As soon as i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. i just tried it on and it is beautiful. i feel gorgeous and glamorous! i can't wait to wear this to a special event as it truly deserves that attention.

the silk is soft and the slip underneath is perfect. the tie in the back perfectly cinches the dress and the pleating is a wonderful detail to the look.

i am 5'0"", 110, and i purchased the small petite. it's slightly big around the armholes and it kind of poofs / puckers out so i'm going to",5
"I love how soft and cozy this sweater is. the addition of some cashmere in the yarn makes all the difference. the red color is beautiful also, perfect for the holidays. flattering cut in the back (it dips down to cover your bum) and the pointelle details are very pretty. fit was tts",5
This top is such a great investment piece. looks classy and is comfortable all at the same time. it is pricey but you will not regret buying this. goes great with light trouser denim or i have the green pilcro khakis. it will he something you will keep in your closet for a long time.,5
"I always end up walking out of an retailer store with something very different than what i thought and this was one. it drapes beautifully and the red color is rich and vibrant, cool tone not orangey. i fell in love with this one in person. it jumped at me in the store, but online i think the outfit that the model is wearing is not my style at all and does not do the item justice. if you like to cover your assets, you will love it.",5
"I live in south florida so i'm always looking for sundresses that will be flattering (but not too clingy or hot), and that i can take from day to evening with accessories. when i pulled this out of the box and walked around in it, it met all my criteria, and as an added bonus, my husband said, ""wow! you look great! where'd you get that dress?"" i'm shocked because as an earlier reviewer said, this dress doesn't seem like much - it's not even lined. but it's comfy, flattering (in all the right pla",5

"I saw this dress on line and knew i wanted it for the spring/summer season. i ordered it almost immediately and i am so glad i did. the photo on the website doesn't do it justice, there are a lot of pretty pastel colors in the paisley pattern that you just can't see on the computer screen. the wrap styling is a very flattering cut for most figures especially hourglass figures like mine and the dress fit's tts (for reference i am 5'9"" and a 36ddd). the silk material is very light and flowy and wi",5
Great that it's hand washable because i hate the smell of dry cleaned garmets.,5
"I love the style and quality of this blouse. it can easily be dressed up or down. the blouse is completely see through and delicate. still, it is so romantic, feminine, distinctive and timeless.",5
Comfortable and great fit and color. high quality.,5
I loved this blouse when i got it and wore it before washing. it fit really well and was flattering. the only time i laundered it i hand- washed it in cold water and hung it to dry. the blouse shrunk at least a full size and in awkward places. the sleeves are now tight and way too short. the overall length shortened by at least 2 inches. the top is so tight in the bust now that the buttons popped open. i'm very disappointed and surprised.i will be returning it as it is unwearable as is.,1
"I haven't worn a halter dress in ages and saw this one and wanted to get it, hoping that it'll fit me. 

i love the swing skirt and the halter. this dress can be easily dressed up or down depending on your mood. there is a side zipper. 

i got s p and it hits me exactly like the dress on the model. it is unlined but with the color of the dress, i don't mind it.",5
"Bought this blouse to wear with high wasted jeans and pants. it lays beautifully and can be dressed up or down. it's somewhat sheer, but i don't plan on wearing a cami under it. perfect for work or going out.",5
"I definitely recommend this shirt. it's lights and airy, something you can wear everyday.",5
"There is no way this is worth the price. i was deeply disappointed when it arrived. the material is thin and feels cheap. i love the design, and anna sui, but this is just so overpriced.",1
This top is really cute and true to size. i like the color and the nice details.,5
"I'm 5' 0"" and 120 pounds. this top is beautiful. it's high neck is so flattering. a nice switch it up for us gals that are older and like neck coverage sometimes. i purchased a small and it is a little longer, but since it has elastic at the waist it's no problem. i will tuck it in my jeans and skirts. the arm holes are perfect. the as far as it being a lot of blouse, i didn't find that at all. but i am busty, 34c or d depending on brand of bra. the color is ivory. omits completely sheer, no lin",5
"Tried this blouse on in the store and fell in love with this top. i went down one size since i am a true petite. they were sold out of the petite small, but the regular x-small fit perfect. it is a little short so it's perfect for shorter people,",5
"These joggers are soo cute. they fit great!!
i seriously love them!! i have worn them so often
i may have to ban myself from them for a week.
i am 5'4 and the length was perfect for a jogger pant.
i got an xs because the small looked too baggy. 
the xs loosened up a little after wearing them and are perfect.",5
"If i could sew, i'd take the fabric from this skirt and make it into a different shape (after ordering a bigger size). the fabric is just as it appears online -- totally gorgeous with almost a quilted feel to it. however, this thickness means the skirt sticks out like something judy jetson would wear. it's also too small in my go-to skirt size (and i order a lot at retailer). the waist and hips are small (making the skirt too short as well), but the bottom flares out ridiculously. i ordered two of",1
"I bought these in the olive green, in the store and will be ordering the gray pair online. i am 5' 9"" and 145 lbs, long legs and these are beyond adorable. some people mentioned that they stretched out? i did not find this to be true. what i do know is they can be dressed up or dressed down. they are flattering and perfect for the spring/summer. i would highly recommend and would/will purchase in every color. well done retailer!! one of my most favorite purchases so far this spring.",5
"The print on these leggings is so cool but they are completely see-through. i mean seriously, seriously see-through.",1
I was so impressed with the style & boning on the sides for the perfect fit! it's truly a classic staple in your closet for that lbd!!,5
"I was surprised how soft and comfy the fabric is on this top. when i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off! it's a little bigger than i would like - i got a small, and am usually between xs and s. may have sized down if the top were available.but the fit and cut are flattering.",5
I usually wear a size 8/10 and i needed a large in this skirt. it flows so beautifully!,5
"I love this little number. the quality is terrific, the weight is perfect, and the cut is superb. i love the way it fits and looks in the arms. i ordered my usual xxsp and it is perfect. i like that it is cool and flowy, without looking like maternity attire. i have the bright turquoise and i am going to order another. i was about to order what looks like a yellow one, but i noticed the color is labeled ""chartreuse"". can anyone tell me if this is more yellow or green in ""real life""?",5
One of 3 pair of leggings ordered and the only pair to fit properly! size l was perfect for me. they stretched nicely going on and the beautiful floral design on the legs didn't get distorted or faded looking from the stretch. wearing these makes me happy :),5
"These leggings are beautiful! so unusual and colorful, comfortable, and flattering. they fit true-to-size with enough stretch to move with you yet retain their shape. the fabric is a bit lighter-weight than ponte but heavy enough to be completely opaque. i would definitely recommend these beautiful leggings to anyone who doesn't mind attracting a little (envious?) attention.",5

Gorgeous cobalt blue color!!!  usually s/m- bought the small (because of larger armholes).  so glad i snatched this one up on sale!  the detail on the top is amazing.,5
"I adore these little joggers. i was immediately drawn to the color (army green) and the little details. i carry all my weight on bottom, so i don't often wear many retailer bottoms (i'm usually a 16). i tried the xl on just to see how they would work and i was pleasantly surprised! they are absolutely perfect. they fit a little baggy, as joggers do, and go with just about everything! mine did loosen a tad, but not like the previous reviewer. i highly recommend these! can't wait to wear these throu",5

"I love this blouse. the lace panels are slightly sheer, but nothing inappropriate. the solid fabric is a lovely sort of heavy crepe. stunning bright cobalt blue color. i'm an xl in retailer and this top fit well in xl; ever so slightly snug at one part on the sleeve but nothing noticeable or uncomfortable. be aware, this did bleed blue when it was soaking and it did drip blue water while it was air drying on the hanger. while this blouse is still wet i would stretch out the sides and sleeves to ge",5
"I wanted a casual, denim colored skirt for warmer weather without the denim weight  and this skirt fit my needs perfectly.  i'm 5'4, 117lbs and the xs fits me true to size, hitting about 1 1/2 inches above the knee. it's a more modest length for daytime but it definitely needs a slip underneath. the raw edge is subtle (no hanging threads) and unique. i can't speak to the lack of colorfastness but i washed it separately and will be mindful of the possibility .",5
"I love this top!! the detail on front top of the top is so cute. the length is just right. i hesitated because of the unusual armhole shape but they are really not an issue. also, thanks for finding the top as it wasn't available at distribution center, went of your way!!",5
"These leggings are beautiful and different. the material is very stretchy, sort of a spandex feel. panty lines definitely show in the back. i found they run true to size; i wear a size 6/medium/28 in pants or jeans and the size medium fit me great.",5
Great lightweight summer top that's bra friendly.  i bought the teal color yesterday and wore it today with white skinnies.    i'm sometimes a small and sometimes a medium and was fine with the small on this one,5

"I love this jumpsuit and definitely feel too confident in it! the fabric is a great weight- flowy, but still substantial enough. with nude undergarments, i can't see anything. in fact, that is one of the things i love; no special undergarments are required, so it is very comfortable and still very flattering. i typically wear a medium- 135 pounds, 5'4"", 34b, 28 waist, 40 hip. i tried the small after seeing some reviews that it ran big. i would have bought it, but the salesperson suggested i try",5

"I love this dress. it is so soft and comfortable, perfect for summer!! i wish it came in more colors because i would buy everyone!!",5
"This is the perfect bralette for comfort; it's soft and fits to form really quickly. i wear a b cup, and it's enough support for me to wear daily doing everything other than heavy exercise. now, at 5 months pregnant it's pretty much perfect to sleep in too. i'm at 35 band, and i'm still wearing it on the loosest closure, but it fits perfectly there for me.",5
"This dress looks better in person. nice navy with subtle pattern - looks super cute with a really lightweat pale yellow sweater! i thought that wiastband area would hit in a funky spot (my problem area) but it doesnt and looks great. super comfortable and i love this neckline. also has a decent lining so no bra necessary if youre cool with that. i have packed on some ""after 50"" lbs and wear a 12-14 shirt and 10-12 pant and the large is roomy enough.i received a number of compliments and let's fa",5
I received this dress as a gift and it has become such a great addition to my wardrobe! i love that i can wear it to work and then out with friends. a great value if you're looking for one special piece that you can get miles out of - you can wear the two pieces separate or together. i love floral and felt this non traditional take on a floral was very refreshing.,5
"Simply awesome. wonderful fit and flatters any body type. looks great booties, flats, or flip flops. must have ...",5
"Although it may not look like it takes on a shape - what a wonderfully flattering jumper. was intrigued from seeing it in the catalog and had to try it on in the store -- i was unsure how the middle would appear. but it fit, wonderfully feminine, looking forward to the summer.",5
I loooove this. my favorite retailer purchase in a while and i buy frequently. ran out of s p while in my basket (there are never enough petites available) so i got the medium. it is big but with this style i can pull it off. it does run a bit large so a s would have been perfect. please make this in more colors/fabrics! i would buy them all!,5
This is such a pretty dress. light and flowy. i got it to wear on hot summer days.,5
I love these pants. i have them in navy and carbon. the navy color seems to run bigger than the carbon. they are very loose like a boyfriend pant in navy. they loosen up as the day goes on as well. super comfy and great for running errands and taking my little one to the park. i can look cute and feel comfy and i can give my yoga pants a break.,5
"Was so thrilled to receive my dress in the mail. its just what i was looking for, for my staple summer dress. i love how i can wear it with or without the sweater top, and even can pair just the sweater top with my high-waisted shorts!",5
"I tried this on in the store in a regular medium and the size was fine, just the length. fortunately retailer will ship for free if you need a petite! i'm so excited to get this. i'm 5'1 and a bit busty, and the medium fit perfect. its very flattering and so comfortable! perfect for a hot summer day. or as the cute clerk in the store had it styled with a cropped jean jacket and a fun necklace. the styling idea's are endless. i'm waiting by the mailbox for it to arrive!",5
"Perfect for the summer weddings that i am attending. i am 5-1, 119#, 32dd and usually a sp. i tried on a regular s and xs in the store, and the s was huge. i ended up ordering the regular xs instead of the petite xs when the 20% off sale hit because i liked the extra length. great bra coverage...it is not too long at the armholes, or too low in the back. i will take it up a bit in the top seams just so it doesn't have quite so much decolletage, but it is wearable as is. this is much more of a ro",5
"A sales associate found this for me at my local retailer. i probably would have never thought to try it on. i am 5'1'' and normally a size 8 or a medium. the size small was still too large, so i ordered a size small petite. it fits perfectly, looks adorable on, and is so comfortable. i can't wait for the warm weather to wear it!",5
"I'm very picky about jumpers, and this one is abolutely perfect! i love how it looks like a dress at first glance. it runs a little big because of the oversized fit it is supposed to have, i sized down because of the armpit area. nude garments and you'll be fine. this is going to sell out fast, don't wait for it to go on sale! (seriously my store is already out of xs's)",5
Nice flowing summer sun dress. i was looking for something very simple and put a colorful kimono over. it. i put a bando under it. i think this dress can be for all ages as my friend in her 20s bought and loves this dress as well.,5
This jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer! unique and absolutely beautiful. i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller. hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece. i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket.,5
"I loved this dress from the moment i saw it! i ordered it immediately, after reading the reviews, and felt confident in my dress size choice...but when it arrived it was big! i am 5'7"" 140lbs with an athletic build and i usually wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, so usually a small but sometimes a medium...because if this ""in between"" that i am, i ordered a small...and it was really too big. so sad...incalled a bunch of stores to try and find an xs but they are sold out everywhere.
style is fun and flir",5
"This dress is great. it appears just as it does online. its soft, flowy and a thin chambray material. the straps are adjustable which makes it a good fit for all women. i am fuller in my hips and toosh and this dress fell beautifully over them. i tried a large (i normally do l or xl in retailer dresses) and there was plenty of room! i would have probably liked the xl more just because i prefer things oversized. the dress is a midi length, very breezy and airy. its extremely comfortable and very fl",5
"I was worried at first that the metal leaves would come off easily. i was pleasantly surprised after a day at disneyland, i don't think i lost even one of them. this dress is super fancy but very comfy.",5
"These jeans have been the best pair of jeans i have ever worn. you could practically sleep in them, they are so comfortable, brushed softness, and stretch easily. they hug your body in a flattering way, that these jeans are worth the money spent, as you'll have them for a while.",5
"I'd been eyeing this for months, loving the look but afraid it'd be too young for me (i'm 58). i tried it on in the store and loved it, with one caveat: it hangs rather like a sack, so i think it needs a belt for waist definition. with a belt, it looks great. my measurements are 38-30-38 and i wear a medium. oh, and contrary to what other reviewers have said, i don't find that the fabric is too thin or transparent.",5
"Great fit. smooth, comfortable material. wrinkles, but nothing an iron can't fix. beautiful colors, i got both the teal and the black.",5
"I tried this on in the store last night and decided to order it today. it is a really beautifully made and flattering dress, with very interestingly cut seams. the fabric is a distinctive flower pattern that has been overlaid to appear almost abstract. gorgeous and high quality!

fit: i am 5'6"" and curvy, usually a size 14/16, and the xl fits quite roomy on me (that's the size i ordered because i like flowy things). so it definitely runs large. usually i have better luck with a-line dress shap",5
"I bought this dress for its green color and flowy design to wear at an irish fest held in the hot summer. it's perfect! being of irish descent with red hair and fair skin, i love all shades of green, and this green dress is no exception. the color is lovely and eye-catching and cool. as to the sizing, i usually wear a size 8, but to make sure due to the design, i ordered an 8 and a 6. there wasn't a great difference between the two dresses, but the size 6 top was a bit more fitted and looked bet",5
"I just bought this at the store. i simply couldn't resist! it is very light and comfortable and could easily be dressed up or dressed down, sandals and a crossbody bag for exploring the city, strappy healed sandals and some flashy jewelry for a garden party or day event, slip on booties and a cardigan for the evening. can't wait to rock it. in terms of sizing, i am 5'5 150 with 36dd bust and some hips and booty. usually i am a size 6-8/m in dresses and pants but in true retailer style, i ended up",5
"Great jumpsuit ! even better ""in person""; elegant and stylish. i'am 5'7 and 165lb , m fits perfectly! material is not see- throug ( that was my biggest concern). sooo happy that i got it.",5
"I purchased this in the mauve color. beautiful color with tan skin for the summer, but also perfect for fall. the material is very thin but not sheer at all. has quite a bit of drape/swing to it so i sized up to make sure it was long enough. it fits me like it fits the model shown here. i am about 5'4"" 115lbs and 32b and am keeping the small.",5
"I originally ordered this in green, and unlike another reviewer, i thought the color was perfect for spring. it is trendy, flattering and fun in green, but perhaps not a color i would wear long-term, so i decided to return it and order it in red and black. i also noted the boxy cut, and if that is what you want, it runs true to size. however, if, like me, you want something a little more form fitting, consider ordering down a size or two (depending on your chest size,) and just carefully shimmy",5
"I tried these on at my local retailer, and was like, no way am i spending almost $300 on a pair of jeans. alas, i could not stop thinking about them. the pictures really don't do them justice. they are a more substantial jean, have a distressed look, without being fragile. and yet they are so soft, so comfortable, you really just don't want to take them off. they do have a bit of stretch, but hold their shape all day long. the length and taper are perfect, in that you can wear them with boots, san",5
"I love this dress, i disagree with the review saying it was too sheer. this is a thicker material and doesnt need a slip, it is beautiful and is so comfy. it looks good with heels or sandals. i definately recommend this dress, it would look good on any body type.",5
"This top is cute and could be worn to work or casually. being tall, i love how long this shirt is! definitely recommend!",5
I purchased the gorgeous green color. i love that i can wear this with leggings and sandals in warm weather or boots and scarves when it's cooler outside. the best thing is that it has pockets to slip my phone in! the color is very flattering and i get lots of compliments when i wear it!,5
I bought the blue pattern and really have found this print to be very fun and flattering and the tunic style great for work and play. highly recommend!!!,5
"This is a beautiful sweater -- soft, lovely color and easy to wear. the current photo is more true to the length. i am 5'2"" and 128 pounds and ordered the regular sm and it fits just below my hips.",5
"Like other reviewers i was hesitant to spend this much on a pair of jeans. however, i purchased them at  20% off on retailer day and...honestly...they look so good i probably would have paid full price. these jeans are fresh!",5
"After reading the reviews, i ordered this dress in an xs and sp. i'm 5' 3"" and 120 lbs. the xs was too long and too big on the bottom while being too tight in the chest. the sp fits perfectly. i'm wearing this to a wedding and know that i will get lots of use out of it for many different occasions.",5
"I always look for things to hide ""parts"" without making my ""parts"" look even more pronounced. this top is much cuter in person than online. it has floral edging around the neck and lace up area i didn't notice. the length is perfect, the sleeve length is perfect and it makes me feel thin (even though it has stripes!). perfect spring summer top.",5
"This shirt is easy, breezy, comfy, and stylish - everything i want as a busy mom. all the patterns are beautiful it i went with the blue motif as well as the floral print because they felt fun and easy to wear with jeans or white pants. this definitely fit a full size large for me. i tried my usual s plus xs thinking the shoulders might be too tight, but the xs was perfect. happy to have this beauty in the rotation!",5
"This is my first pair of realllly expensive jeans, and they were worth every penny. i love the fit, the distressing, everything about them. they make me feel like i look amazing, which is what good jeans should do! i wear a 31 in pilcro jeans, but based on some reviews went up to a 32 in these and they are perfect. also, i'm 5'6 but the crop length hits at my ankle, which is perfect.",5
Shortened it to knee length and it was perfect. material is soft. comfortable to wear. can be paired with wedges or pumps or flats. fits true to size.,5
This shirt is just so easy breezy! i got the blue motif and love the pattern. the top is loose but it's supposed to fit that way. i have a feeling this will be my go to for the spring summer! i'm about 136lbs and ordered a small.,5
"If there ever was the perfect feminine dress, this would be it .",5
"I'm small (4'11, 98 pounds and 34a) so the regular xs looks like a baby doll dress on me.  i just wear the tunic with a tank top underneath (or i can wear the tunic by itself) and leggings plus a pair of boots.  the top part is slightly baggy so if you want tight fitting, is size down to xxs.  i got the yellow flower and white + grey one and plan to get the navy one soon.  the quality is good and you can machine wash it with cold water.  i plan to use a tide sweater garment bag to wash it (i put",5
"I usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, ordered this top in an s and it was so wide on the sides and huge it fit like a tent.  not even remotely flattering.  i thought about ordering it in an xs, however, i could tell the xs was still going to have way too much fabric.  back it goes.",1
"I initially purchased this shirt in the grey motif color, size l (my usual size, i'm 5'8"" size 14). unfortunately i found the shirt very roomy, but loved the pattern and style. so i ordered a medium and much to my surprise it fit much better. i'm very happy with my purchase.",5
"I bought the dress in black. it is very elegant with a fun flare, suits my taste. it does run a size too small like other reviewer mentioned. the material has no give at all. i couldn't breathe in my regular size. one size up fits like a glove. it is a perfect party dress to show your free and fun spirit!",5
"I agree with the previous comments. the vest runs a little large, so you can easily size down for a more form-fitting fit. it is so soft and the colors are lovely ... will be a welcome addition when the weather turns a little cooler. i am so glad i purchased this vest!",5
Fit great - maybe a bit large....i bought a l (typically i go between a large and extra large) and there is room to put a thick sweater on underneath it.  this goes with just about everything!,5
I just bought this top yesterday in the yellow. i can't wait until it warms up a little more to wear it. it's very comfortable and very cute. i did have to size down. i may get one of the other prints as well.,5
I ordered the yellow/floral version in size xl. it fits me just as shown with the model so it's true to size. it's very comfortable and made well. the floral looks the same in person as in the photos too.,5
"I love this dress!! it has a beautiful european flair, and more beautiful in person. i don't agree with the other reviewers that its see through-the fabric is a good quality, and thicker than you would think. the variable length is the best part of the dress. the color looks beautiful with a tan summer glow!",5
"Got the flower print and it is really a nice top. covers the butt!. i normally need a xl, but in this top i got a large.",5
"I have received so many compliments on this top. it really looks exactly like it does on the model, and i'm not as thin as she is. i am 5'5"" and 134 lbs,, small on top, and bought the small in this top. the v-neck is very flattering and is hangs so nicely that it does not make me look hippy. looks great from all views. i paired it with white pencil pants and wedge heels. also, the black lace detail down the sides looked great when i paired it with black yoga pants and flip flops. the colors are",5
"Perfect party dress - well constructed, bra hidden at arms and on top, what more can you ask for? i felt like betty draper the moment i put it on. i'm normally a 6, but the 4 (while fitted) looked amazing and didn't pull.",5
I love this shirt! it hides my tummy perfectly without being too baggy! super cute!!,5
"I bought the tangerine version of this dress for my brother's summer wedding in the south, and i can't wait to wear it. cotton material has a touch almost like linen, but not rough. nice and hearty fabric. tangerine color is beautiful, more salmon than coral. wearing it with a little shoulder shrug and the laika inca shoes?the shoes aren't on the retailer site anymore, but i found them at my local store. just perfect.",5
"I purchased this top in white. it is see through so i wear a tank or cami underneath. i usually wear xs or s in retailer tops and in this one, i purchased the xs, but wish i had bought a s. the problem is the top is just small enough to pull slightly between the top two buttons. for reference, i am 5'6, weigh 128 lbs, 34b bra size, 28 jean size, and small boned. i currently carry most of my weight in my hips and waist. my normal weight is 110-112 lbs and i add this to point out that i am out of sh",5
"Picture definitely does not do this vest justice.  i saw it on a rack and had to try on and instantly loved the look and feel.  i am 5'9"" - 135 lbs - size 6 and the small works for me.  the vest will work with ivory, black, grey, and red underneath.  i love the little bits of fur sticking out of the seams.  the back has fitted seams to give it a trim look.  there are small pockets in the front as well.  definitely worth the 108$ asking price.",5
I purchased this in 2 colors. the black which is really actually a dark grey( no complaints) and the cream with black print version. i have worn both at least once a week and receive compliments everytime! looks great with skinny pants or jeans. great alone or layered with a jacket or cardigan. does run on the looser side fyi,5
"This is my favorite dress i have ever purchased. as a 6' tall woman, it's hard to find flattering dresses that are long enough for my legs. this dress is classic, comfortable, and truly flattering. i love the blush color and did not have the issues that other people listed for the color being see-through. i can't get enough of this style...i'll be buying it in black too...ooopss :)",5
"Bought this top in white and blue motif. it fits me great and looks adorable. the only comment is that the holes for the buttons are a little too big but it's an easy fix.
this top looks great dressed up or down. would definitely recommend!",5
"Just purchased this yesterday in the store and i can't wait to wear it! it is a perfect spring/summer top when you just want to wear something pretty and comfortable! i agree that it is big but that is the style of this shirt. so if you're ok with this look, you will love this shirt! i took my usual medium and the prints are adorable! a great addition to my wardrobe!",5
Love this shirt. tried it on in 2 of the colors and both were very flattering. the quality of the shirt is great. worth the price for sure!,5
"Love this top! i receive so many compliments wearing it, even from my teenage boys! runs large, but that's the style of it, very flowy. very flattering.",5
"I'm so short that this could be a dress! runs a little big, but very forgiving. the green color is so vibrant! love love love!",5
"This light blouse is beautiful and true to size. i ordered the black one and love it!
i would recommend this product",5
"Stopped in to my local retailer today specifically for this top. i was pleasantly surprised - the green is even more vibrant in person! just gorgeous. typically a size small but based on reviews tried on the extra small. still a tad roomy but portland doesn't carry petite sizing aaaaandidon'twanttopayforshipping... remedy that, retailer portland!",5
"This sweater poncho is a nice versatile piece to wear in the fall. wear a blouse or tee under for extra warmth for the maine winters. love the side buttons and the uniqueness of this poncho. true to size, great color. lot's of compliments.",5
"Love this top. bought it in both color ways. just adorable and washes well. great option for larger ladies. 
retailer needs to provide more xls to be available in the stores. i shop at the pasadena store and see so many women my size shopping right next to me, and there is nothing for us. it is so sad that we want to spend our money with you, but you don't want it.",5
"This beauty arrived in my store today...and despite all my gals telling me that i own too many vests, i just had to have this one. i've always wanted a cozy fur or sherpa vest...but i'm curvy and always feel like those add bulk. this one only has sherpa on one side (the softest most cozy sherpa ever) and its not too bulky! the print is even better than it appears online...in fact, the vest almost appears pink online, and its not in person. there is much more variation in color in person! i adore",5
"I love swing tops. the more swingy, the better! this top is so fun. its a little hard to tell online, but its made of two fabrics. most of the fabric is a thin t-shirt material, and then theres a panel on one side thats more of a silky fabric. its so so cool! the colors are just as they appear online, and the print is fun and edgy. i have larger arms, so i love the length of the sleeves. the other reviewer said it was cropped, but i did not have that experience. in fact i was able to wear mine w",5
"I really wanted to love this dress. two lovely associates paired it with the desideria bib necklace and the black dakota cardigan, which gives the outfit definition and elegance. but the dress by itself would have needed altering to fit my 34-b top. i chose size m because of the length-- the small was 1 1/2 "" shorter in front (i am 5'8"") in the end, i realized i would probably choose my other favorites from my closet. but it will be stunning on the right person.",5
"I love this dress - originally ordered the medium, which is my normal size, especially because i am tall. the arm holes were gaping, and so i returned for the small. the small is perfect. it fits exactly as on the model, and i didn't have a problem with the color being see-through. it really is so unique but so simple. the color is perfect. 

i took a single star off because it is not lined - for the price, this would have been nice.",5
"I've been on the hunt for the perfect dress to wear for my daughter's first birthday party. since we are throwing a traditional korean first birthday, i was looking for a dress you might wear to a daytime wedding or a fancy brunch. i just purchased this dress today in the store and it fits my needs perfectly. 

i disagree with the first reviewer who mentioned that this dress was too sheer. this dress is a thicker fabric so i do not think i will need a slip when wearing it. it does drape nicely",5
"This shirt is so very pretty in person. the detail on the neckline and the lace up on the back are so cute and give the shirt just a bit of whimsy, making it more unique than your usual flowy t-shirt. it lays perfectly and the material is very soft and comfy. you can wear it casual or dress it up. i may get another one because this is the kind of shirt i will wear constantly!",5
"I usually wear a size 28 & the fit was perfect. highly recommend, many compliments.",5
"I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it in store. i tried it on immediately and knew i had to have it. it fits a little big -- definitely size down. but other than that, i have never felt more beautiful than when i wear this. the color is a perfect blush pink and the drop waist/tiered skirt make you feel downright bridal when wearing it, despite it being the perfect fabric for day. i find that this dress is perfect for those days at work when i have an event later.. it can be dre",5
"This is a such a cute top. can be dressed up for work or worn more casually. very flattering. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb. i was borderline between the xs and s but ended up with the s because it was a tad longer and more 'tunic-y.' bought two colors!",5
"I loved this top so much i bought it in both colors. size down because it run very large, but it is nice and flowy. i'm 5'11"" and slim and the top hung nicely on me.",5
"This is a very flattering / soft sweater. the pockets make it so much cuter & do not make me look ""thick"". highly recommend!",5
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and ordered it immediately. i was a bit disappointed that the dress is a little lighter than the pink showed in the catalog but it didn't deter my liking it because it's still a lovely shade of pink. the fabric takes a bit getting used to though - i thought it would be silkier but it's really a thicker fabric. i ordered a size small and i usually wear size 4. the dress drowned me. so i returned it for an xs, which fit me beautifully. so",5
"This is such an adorable tee. the stripes and lace up details are super cute and on trend. i usually take a xxs and that is what i took in this tee. i tried the xs and at 5""1 and 104 pounds it looked a bit loose and long on me. love this tee and highly recommend this one!",5
"This shirt runs large, so order down a size. it is comfortable, cute and great for transitioning from summer into fall. adding jewelry really dresses this top up. can't wait to layer it with kimono, vest, pashminas or wraps. great with sandals or boots. glad i bought both colors. it looks much better on, than in the photo/on hanger. great purchase and can't wait to wear!",5
"I purchased this poncho online in the cream color. when it arrived i tried it on to decide whether or not to keep it. i immediately went on line and purchased the taupe color , as well. thank goodness it didn't come in 5 more colors! this sweater is so versatile and beautifully detailed, plus it is very soft. you take one look at it and you know the quality! i think you could wear this dressed up or down and it would be perfect either way. i do agree, it is not quite as long as pictured , but pe",5
"The green is a deep, beautiful shade. the fabric and fir is very flattering!",5
"Love this white shirt! it fits great and gives you a little breathing room around the waist. this goes with shorts, skirts, and jeans. i will be wearing it all summer",5
"Gorgeous baby blue lace is a must see. i received many compliments. my only gripe is that i don't love when shirts have those connecting camisoles (which make it harder to put on) as i would much rather just have a sewn in lining, but it didn't deter me. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, muscular/curvy frame and a size 4 fit perfectly.",5
Super cute poncho to add to my wardrobe.  love the grey color and the material is super soft.  glad i snagged this up for less than $30!,5
"Great top!! love the fit, it pairs great with dark denim and pearls!! i ordered a 00 and am a 32c cup and 24-25 waist",5
This sweater is a perfect transition piece!  the material is really soft. while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and doesn't make you look like a big blob.,5
I am obsessed with this top. it is even more gorgeous in person.... a real showstopper!,5
Beautiful color and a great lightweight piece for fall layering. the petite sizing was perfect for me. more like a belted kimono. very happy with this purchase,5
"This a lovely piece. you have to see it close up to appreciate the subtle details. i typically wear xxsp or xsp, so i did not expect this to fit, but decided to try it because i liked the style. as a petite, many poncho styles overwhelm me and look like tents. not this one. the xxs fit nicely - just the right length and width. i am 5'1"" and 108 lbs. i think one of the reasons this has not been popular is because it only shows up when searching on ponchos, and not when you search for sweaters. it",5
"Absolutely love this top. it is beautiful, well made and so unique.",5
The blue lace with the white top underneath is very pretty. unfortunately i did not like how billowy it was below the bra line.,5
"I knew i wanted this top the moment i saw it, so onto my wishlist it went until it went on sale! it fits beautifully in my normal size and i love that it already has a coordinating tank top. i get compliments whenever i wear it- think hd in paris might be my new go-to!",5
"This is probably a blouse for curvy women. with that i mean large breasted. i am a 40d and the xl fits well and the cleavage is in the limit of ok for the office. the bottom is a little too large but not too long. however, the fabric feels extremely comfortable and it stretches but it doesn't lose the shape. i am tempted to buy 2 more. if you are thin, you probably need to size down.",5
This tee is super soft and thin. perfect for hot humid days. i went with the neutral version and it is adorable with chino shorts or jean shorts. i found it ran big.. i purchased in xs and still pretty baggy.,5
"I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell, which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair, after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4), they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn't return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now, but it's disappointing.",1
I'm so incredibly disappointed. the dress is beautiful but the one i received is torn and has multiple strands of beads missing. poor quality control.,1
"These leggings are wonderful. they are incredibly soft, and stay in place when working out.",5
I initially tried this on in store and fell in love with the beautiful cut out details and fit. the star design is really cute and unique and the blue color is not see-through at all. i eventually had to buy the blouse online because i could not stop thinking about it. also machine washable is a major plus.,5
"This dress has special written all over it. the poms at the hem and bodice, as well as the rows of black seed beads push are the kind of details that stand out. i like all the varying textures. it looks great with sandals or short boots. fits true to size. a nice sassy length.",5
I found this dress at my local retailer must be a web order return i feel in love with it once i put it on its better in person that online but it does run a little tight in the chest area  it was fine for me as i'm not big busted,5
"I tried these on in-store not intending to buy them (was trying on shirts and needed to see how they would look with jeans!) and loved them! great ""medium blue"" color and they fit me so nicely (i am 5'2"" with actual hips and thighs :) ...the price is a bit high for me though. hoping to find a pair at some point when they are on sale!",5
Very disappointed. the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it. i've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing.,1
Love this soft sweatshirt. the peplum makes it a little different and the quality is great. go to piece for spring. loose fitting but true to size in shoulders.,5
"Beautiful and very feminine look but run big. i m 5ft 105 lbs curvy , size 00 fit me well",5
"I really like this jacket. very comfortable, nice material. i like the weight of this jacket, i wore it alone but it will be cute with a t-shirt under it too.",5
"Ordered this dress for a summer wedding. it is so cute! true to size, well made with a hint of tulle. super comfortable for moving and dancing. winner!",5
It's short and wide. not a good combo for anyone who isn't stick thin.,1
"I wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing. the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online. once i pulled it out of the bag, my first thought was how could retailer send me a used, washed and shrunken sweater. it is nothing like the picture. it fits like a midriff top, not exaggerating. i'm 5.6, ordered the m, don't waste your shipping money on this.",1
Love this t-shirt. the weight is great for the impending heat and humidity of summer. it looks positively fabulous for casual occasions with pilcro chinos in moss and fuchsia suede pumps.,5
Cute top but started disintegrating after two washes. the delicate cutouts in the top tore apart. i machine washed it in the gentle cycle and didn't use the dryer. disappointed to have to discard the top after just buying it.,1
I purchased the yellow and i am quite happy. it matches a lot of things that i already own. nice summer tee.,5
"I bought the ""here comes the sun"" version of this shirt. i had to have it. i'm a cervical cancer survivor who is still dealing with some health issues. i recently attended a cancer survivor event where a women talked about her life with cancer. she said that you no longer counts the years of her life, instead she counts her sunny days. i was inspired to do the same. so, i love this shirt. i got it on sale, but it still could've been cheaper.",5
"I received this as a gift. it is a very pretty top, but the material is sooo delicate that the cutout areas were torn in many spots and where it wasn't torn completely you could see it fraying. the sales associate said they get many returns on this item.",1
"Love this tee! lightweight, airy and comfy. i think it fits true to size. so soft and summery. can't wait to wear it this summer!",5
"This is much more a blouse than a ""tee"". the detailing is beautiful and the fabric on the back is a more stuff, starched cotton, not stretchy jersey. because of that i felt like this top ran small. i had to size up.",5
"I tried this on today and i wish i had taken it home. for me it was true to size, and the star print was perfect. flowy but not in maternity way at all. i'm gonna have to go back for this one!",5
"Love the diving beauty version, it is charming without being too ""cutsie"" which i stay away from. the epitome of summer and that grab and go easy little statement. i find it runs true to size...you could safely size down if need be. love it! thinking of getting the here comes the sun too! tuck it in, tie it in the back or side or great just draping...love the little touch on the sleeve too...nice surprise!",5
"This is great. on the model it looks largish, but on me it doesn't. if you're curvier like me (5'10"", 155, 32e) it may be more fitted. long arms with great wrists. design is just as shown. not a sturdy piece. but not cheap looking in any way. i plan to hand-wash and not drop coffee down the front so i can wear it for a long time. just what i want to wear on certain days, and more colors would be great. thanks, retailer.",5
"Comfortable material, fits true to size, love the color and can wear all year round. selected this dress for a fall wedding and its a keeper!",5
I stumbled across this dress at the store and fell in love. it's so bright and cheery but still sophisticated enough for most events. i love that the tulle that gives the skirt a slight flare and body is completely concealed. the dress is well lined and darling. i am small chested so i didn't have an issue with it feeling revealing nor did the lining hang out. i purchased this for my rehearsal and rehearsal dinner for my summer wedding. i look forward to wearing the dress many times after.,5
"I""m not crazy about maxi dresses so when i found this fun print with fringe-it spoke my language. love this dress. feel this dress will work with many seasons. dress falls nicely and feels comfortable. i was worried it would be too long but with a 2 inch heel-its perfect. have paired it with some red dangled earrings that spice it just right.",5
"Fantastic signature retailer styling with this unique statement sweater. the pattern placement has a slimming look on the front and a rear enhancing look from behind. i've been using the super soft removable fur collar as a scarf and stole for my other outfits as well. the length is almost tunic on me, so it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans while buttoned up. if you choose to remove the fur collar the v-neck is very open, so i keep it unbuttoned when i style it that way. knit fabric is s",5
I purchased this dress for my bridal shower and it was perfect! the details on it are amazing-delicate and lovely! i am 5'11'' and it hit just above my ankles which i loved because i could show off my shoes!,5
"I bought the design which has now sold out, of the sailboats and waves along the top. the t-shirt is super soft and thin. but, it's not sheer or see-through. very light and cool for hot humid summer days. has some nice stretch as well. a really gentle cotton knit.

this top does run large. maybe that's so it will be cool and not stick to you? thus, i didn't size down because i don't like clothes too form-fitting on super hot days.",5
"I just couldn't resist this dress! it's blue, it's fun, it's feminine. the color is so vivid and beautiful in person. i was worried that the length would be an issue (i bought a regular size instead of my normal petite), but i feel that it is perfect. it fits great, and i know i will wear it a lot this summer.",5
"Great fit, perfect length! so happy with these jeans. the fabric is pretty stretchy but definitely still has a denim feel. very soft - love these jeans!",5
"I bought this top at my local retailer in a burgundy color. it is so beautiful and feminine. i want to get it in the other color they had in the store and also this black one available on-line. i bought it in a size 6 and i am 5' 2"" , 34d. i sometimes get tops in petite but i felt the reg size fit just fine.",5
I purchased this item as a gift for my wife and she loves it. the quality for the price is great. soft and comfortable. needs to be washed with care but is worth it,5
"Many compliments - great color and so comfy. most of my dresses from retailer are maeve brand, and i have never been disappointed.",5
Tts and very very sleek and flattering. just love for summer. nice light weight. feel great on and not saggy. nice color addition since my other favorite are lighter shade of blue.,5
"I really love this this dress, but i agree with the previous reviewer about the belt around the waist-it is a draped piece of fabric that is very figure flattering where it wraps, but one side of the dress has no belt and it shows muffin tops/bulges.i would have loved this if the belt went all the way around. one other point i would like to make is that bra straps are hard to conceal. i bought this dress because of the gorgeous color, but ended up returning it because of the belt and bra strap i",5
This is by far the most comfortable bra i've ever owned. i love the convertible strap feature. it's great for shirts with a back cutout.,5
"I bought this tank in the blue popsicle print, and i think it's cuter in person than it is online. the beautiful pastel colors on the popsicles really stand out and make it special. i am normally a size 4-6, and the small fits me perfectly. also, i appreciate that it's lined. i wore it with skinnies, and received lots of compliments. it's the perfect tank for summer!",5
"This well made chemise is figure flattering and just the right length for me (5'2""). i would wear it as a slip or a nightie. looking forward to wearing it!",5
"This is just a fantastic dress! i bought it in my usual m in the blue and it fits like a glove. i love the varying lengths and the adorable sleeves and the substantial knit which feels amazing on the body without revealing any bumps and lumps :) i took the regular length and found it perfect. the front hits about two inches above my knee and the rest hits a bit lower. i'm only 5""1, but i prefer dresses that hit closer to my knee than mini so the regular was perfect for me
definitely a keeper!",5
"This dress is perfection it is extremely comfortable and versatile. great for dressing up or down. i am large busted (36g) so was delighted that it stretches as this is a problem for me finding clothing to fit allover. i am petite 5""1 with a curvy figure and a regular medium fit great!",5
"This is a great summer maxi dress. i am 5'4"" 120lbs, about a size 4 in dresses, 32dd. i got this in an extra small. i was really happy that on someone my height, it's just a few inches above my ankle, so did not shorten me at all. the straps were a good length, and the waist hit at the right spot. i don't think the waist detail not going all the way around is a big deal, there are the little snaps in the straps for your bra, and skirt is lined. the turquoise color is really pretty and the fabric",5
This dress is super comfortable and the material is so soft. the fit is very flattering and will cover any imperfections if you are heavier and want to hide anything. its more fitted in the top and drapes on the body very nicely. the hem is asymmetrical and the highest part of the hem hits about 2 inches above my knee and i am 5'3.'' i will wear this with tights for work. color is very nice also.,5
"I love this dress!!! it's comfortable, flattering and stylish. looks great with flats or boots - awesome with a chunky scarf and tights.",5
"I ordered a regular size xs and the length is still fine for me at 5'2"". i love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfortable. i'll get a lot of use out of it this summer and the sale price is a great bargain!",5
I am so glad i tried this dress on. it is so chic and beautiful! perfect for an evening out or during the day. i can't believe the price!,5
"I'm a big retailer buyer- and usually love the dresses, especially the petite xs maxis. this was the worst retailer purchase i have ever made. 

it was humongous and gave me no shape. even if i purchased an xxsp it probably would be the same. i'm small but i mean come on- this would only fit a giantess-- which also makes no sense because it's the petite size. 

do not buy. i'm very upset i have to pay the $5.95 return fee since i ordered this.",1
I love this! i will sport it in the spring with white capris/ leggings and awesome for a beach cover-up! the fit is comfy the embroidery gives it a feminine touch. i purchased the large but could've gotten away with a slender fit in medium. i am 5'4 170 lbs.,5
Love! highly recommend...usually i wait for sale price but this was worth the extra splurge. so flattering!,5
"This is a great dress for all body types. the fabric is substantial and soft.  i sized down for a closer fit, but i could have also bought my usual medium and had the extra space to belt it and wear a looser fit. i busted out the boots, a little early, and the outfit was done.  super easy to wear, dressed up or dressed down.  totally worth the price, i'm glad i didn't wait until it went on sale for fear of selling out.",5
"Looks fitted on, but this just turned out to be an oversized muumuu on. the fabric also felt cheap.",1
"This is a solid well made transistional dress going from late summer to fall. i'm 5'7"" and got the medium and it falls a little above my knee. i could see it being very flattering on many body types. i do think you need to accessorize the dress as it is on the bland side. i bought the plum/brown color and am very happy with it.",5
"Perfection! i am 5'3""/108 and the size 25 fit me like a glove. beautiful color too!! highly recommend!!",5
"Thrilled that this not only fits great on me but i got it at a deep sale price!  all the problems that the negative reviewers had did not apply to me at all.  i'm so glad i gave this a try.  my body is large on top with a square waist, a bit of a tummy, no hips or bum and the medium petite skimmed over all my flaws and made me look more proportionate.  not sure why this is called halter though.  i am 5'3"" 36dd, wide torso, size 28 jeans, 140#.",5
"So i got this on sale and the only size they had was a xs petite. i didn't have my hopes very high but i thought i would give it a shot. the dress came today and it fit great. i am 5""6"" so the petite came just above my knees but the dress is still adorable. the material and cut is great. this is not what i was looking for but it is a welcome addition.",5
This dress is beautiful. it is longer than it looks on the model (i'm 5/5) but drapes beautifully. it is perfect for a wedding or a special event. i love it!,5
"This dress is super soft and really flattering. i'm 5'2"" and i tried a regular size m in the store and hated it on me, but decided to order a petite m and give it a try and i love it. it's one i've been wearing a lot with ankle boots and all sorts of jackets. it's great for these fall days that are still warm-ish. would be really cute with tights.",5
Love the sweater. the knit has a rich look and the fit is perfect. i paired it with a printed pencil skirt for an eclectic look. strongly recommend to your wardrobe.,5
"Hi ladies,
does this bra take a contortionist to put it on the first time? yes. did my boyfriend laugh at me hysterically while i tried to get it over the girls? yes. however, i am a large chested girl 34d, i bought the large and this is honestly the absolute best, most comfortable, amazing, non hurting/poking best strapless bra i have ever owned. i just bought three more, just in case the first two wear out. i love this, i love how far it comes down on the sides, i love that it doesn't slip do",5
"I just got this in the mail & had to immediately write a review. i love it!. i took a risk & ordered the xxs, which i assume is a 00. it fits me perfectly so i would say it runs large. i'm a true dress size 2 but usually wear a 0 or xs in us sizing. the shoulder length from seam to seam is about 14 inches. i'm 32c-24-34. hope this helps!",5
"This shirt feels so nice, it's heavier weight and so soft.. i think it's lyocel... such a great drape to the shirt that is so flattering. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and 34c/d and purchased a size 4. found this item to be true to size, if not slightly loose, but i love the flow of it. highly recommend, the green is classic and timeless, very versatile.",5
"Love it! the light blue is a gorgeous color. i thought this might be more chambray, but i'm happy it's not. it's also stitched at the top so no awkward accidental peep show or need for annoying tape.",5
"Love this top! i bought it last month in the olive green color and love it. great quality fabric, comfortable and can be dressed up or down.",5
"I love this top, i dress it up when i need to be more professional and i dress it down with a pair of cutoffs when it's warm. it is delicate, however, so i try not to wash it too frequently. the front is a bit boxy, which the model demonstrates. the model really encompasses the crisp whiteness of the shirt, the flow of it and the length.",5
"While there us no clasp and this bra does require you to pull it over your head, i did not find it to be too difficult. i love that the bra stays in place and that i do not have to constantly pull it up throughout the day! it's quite comfortable too. i wish i had ordered the same bra with the straps too before they sold out of my size!",5
"Slighty fitted, flattering, very soft and not itchy. the orange is a very nice color.",5
Saw this on the sale rack and decided to try on. i looked like the dancing hypos in the movie fantasia. i am petite and not heavy but this is for very slim and tall people. too much fabric in the peplum part.,1
This product is comfortable and stylish. i love the design and the color print. i can dresss it up and dress it down. it goes with everything and also fits great.,5
I got these on sale a few months ago. they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever owned. i'm 5'4 and they are the perfect length for me but i like my jeans a little long.,5
"I had this dress in my basket for a long tiem waiting for free shipping. i liekd how it looked on the model. read the reviews, and wasn't sure, so waited... then my usual size sold out, so i decided ot try the smaller size (in petites, otherwsie i would have gotten it in the store :_)) i needed pettie and the smaller size is perfect! the color says black, but it looks more mifnight (aka blue), my friend even said (when i tried it on), you know i laways love anything blue... so don't expect dark",5
Love this top for the fall. looks great with dark skinny jean and booties.,5
Love this design it puts a twist on a turtle neck sweater. the only problem i had is that the tie kept coming undone but if you do a double knot the problem is solved! wish i would have bought all the other colors.,5
"I tried these in store, didn't have much hope as flare usually looks terrible on me (small waist and athletic, fuller legs). but surprisingly these work great. they seem to very good quality and the flare is super cute and on trend. i do think they run a little small. i am almost always a 2/26, but i took these in a 4. they didn't have a 2 in store for me to compare but i think they would have been too tight. highly recommend!",5
"I ordered these because i loved the wide cut and overall look. but returned them because they fit weird. too tight around the too high waistline (and normally, i like a high waistline). fit ran small. and the overall quality of the fabric wasn't as nice as i was hoping for. pretty disappointed.",1
"Love these pants!!! retailer - please sell more colors and patterns of these! i have a hard time finding work pants that fit right, don't have to be hemmed (i'm 5'3"") and aren't boring. this is just enough pattern to be interesting, but still neutral enough to pair with other things. i bought them full price and would happily do so again for another pattern!",5
This is a very well made top. i love everything about this top! bought it in both colors. i think it's fancy enough to wear out at night or in the daytime with shorts and flip flops. i got it on sale but would have totally paid regular price for it!,5
"I wish i hadn't waited so long to buy this! the smalls were sold out in grey by the time i finially did, but the medium ended up being totally fine. perfect for a warmer winter, it is pretty thin so i wouldn't trust it on it's own to keep you warm in cold weather, but easily could be layered! i love the fun aspect of the tie front for this sweater as the front tuck is becoming a little tired in my eyes. i love that you can make it shorter or longer or even tuck it in because the ties aren't sewn",5
Love this sweater. i have it in cream and ordering navy. it is comfortable and looks great with pants or a skirt. i do not like my sweaters tight so i have a large and love the fit. i am 5' 4'' and weigh 135 and usually buy medium to large.,5
I love this! seriously would buy again. i wish it was warmer out so i could wear it,5
"I have a small collection of retailer pants for work, and this pair fit neatly into a hole-- i don't have a fun, patterned pair. i am short (5'2"") and definitely needed a petite to get the crop to land in the right spot. my usual 0p fit perfectly up above. the flare seems a bit more pronounced on me than in the picture. the fabric is nice quality, smooth and medium weight with a bit of stretch, and i like the fact that these are machine washable. this gal has other things to do with her life besid",5
"I wanted to like this top so so so so badly. so badly in fact, that after the first size didn't fit, i ordered two other sizes to make sure: xl, l, m. none of them worked i really wanted to like this top. the online photo makes the clothing look so flattering and the shirt is just not....at least on me. the shirt online on the model looks slimming and a lot longer than the actual piece of the clothing. the beaded work is very beautiful, but short causing the very poofy peplum to start at the mos",1
I love these pants so much i even paid full price for them.  i'm going to order them in navy too.  super cute fit.  cute with flats or heels.,5
"I stumbled upon this by accident and i thought the turquoise color looks unique so i tried it on, and it was a great fit first time around. i dislike open shoulder blouses because most of them are too open but this one is very sutble which gives it a girl next door sexy look. the material is very soft, the pattern is subtle plaid, and the liner is a plus. size 2 regular fits me very comfortably (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i could size down more but i like the relaxed look like on the mod",5
"Gorgeous colors on lovely silk skirt. longer on me than in photo, but i'm only 5'4"". i usually wear a size 12 or 32"" waist jeans, but i could not zip up the large. by several inches. i'm not sure if i can possibly cover the waist and still wear it that way. sad because i've had my eye on this for months:(",5
"Absolutely beautiful - 
usually don't leave reviews here, but this top (material, beading, style) is so gorgeous i would be remiss if i didn't. i have a short torso, so the peplum hit me above the belly-button. it's very voluminous, but with the right pants and heels, it is a perfect outfit. as a full-time student, i'm apt to find retailer expensive - but this purchase was so very much worth it. in terms of sizing- i initially got the s to accommodate my bust (30f) but preferred the xs.",5
Very cute! waist is a little big for me but overall a pretty good fit.,5
"Tried this on and loved it! chic, lightweight, warm, cute left as is and cuter belted. ended up letting a friend buy it since it was the last one but will be adding to my iso list for sure!",5
"I love this shirt! i was surprised by the other reviews. it's boxy, but not unflattering. i get so many compliments on this. a steal for the price.",5
"It's rare to find such a great skirt -- flattering, unique design, substantial (denim-like) fabric, something with pockets! this skirt has everything, including an adjustable buckled waist. i love the slight a-line shape, too. for me it fits true to size (the same size i wear in skirts from other brands). i love the colors -- ivory background, cobalt, periwinkle, orange, blush pink, yellow, black. it will be easy to pair with tees or button-down shirts and cute sandals.",5
"This skirt fits my curves so well. the adjustable waist is so helpful for getting the perfect fit. it sits high on me, but i have a very long torso so that didn't bother me and actually made the length more flattering for my shorter legs. the colors are vibrant and versatile.",5
"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.",1
"Ordered this top online, color is a little more gray than green but it is gorgeous, comfortable and flattering, so much so, i am ordering the navy too. great quality , fabulous with jeans .",5
"I love this blouse! the colors of the little sunglasses are vibrant against the black background, the buttons on the front are also a coral/peach color and beautifully made. its thin enough to be worn in the summer or fall without making you sweat or freeze. i ordered a medium, which i usually wear in most retailer tops and it fits perfectly. i'm a 36b and can run from an 8 to a 10 in tops. i do recommend trying it on before purchasing if you can, especially for women with a larger bust. th",5
"Girls, this dress is gorgeous.  but if you are an a/b cup, there is just too much fabric in the bust.  the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down, so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number.  alas, i had to send it back and was very sad to do so.",5
This skirt is pleasantly more dynamic in person. the print and colors are really nice and more vibrant than the photos. the cut was spot on and the fabric seems heavy enough to hide imperfections (but not too heavy...) length as shown on model.,5
"This top can be dressed up or down, very good quality fabric and colors shown as the photo (blue). i usually wear petite sizes but chose the regular version because i wanted to be able to tuck it in. i think it might be too short otherwise.",5
Love the color (cedar). love the style. sleeves are long and wide but that is the style. biggest surprise is that this sweater is not cropped. the length given in the product info is very short. but when i received my normal size (l) the sweater comes to my hips. just right. the fibers are man-made (acrylic) so that makes this sweater not too warm and not itchy. the weave is close enough that i do not need to wear a cami underneath. when the weather gets colder i will add a nice cami under the s,5
"Love everything about it!! chunky, comfortable, lazy day or dress up with a cool necklace!",5
"Love, love this clever eyeglass print. i bought the black background with bright sunglass print - perfect for pairing with jeans, shorts or a slender skirt.",5
Exactly as pictured. great fit. love it.,5
"Absolutely love everything about this sweater. i was hesitant to buy because it's so oversized and i was worried it would overwhelm my small frame. but the xs fits great, i love the large knit look and the bell sleeves. pairing with dark denim skinny jeans helped balance out the sweaters oversized shape. wore it work and then to a party and received compliments on it all day.",5
I wear this vest two ways - over a long sleeve shirt when it's warmer and layered over a shirt and cardigan when it's cooler. it's the perfect amount of warmth when i'm running errands and don't want to wear a heavy coat. love it and plan to wear it a lot!,5
"The quality of this vest is outstanding, and the warmth is exceptional. i have worn it as a jacket on milder days, in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe. it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted. it runs large by style, but i am 5'1"", 100 lbs and i can carry it off.",5
"I love this skirt! it's a denim material, so it's structured, but not too heavy for warm weather. the colors are bright. it may run a bit big, but i didn't have trouble with my usual size. the pockets are actually usable. great for casual and easy to dress up.",5
Love the print of this fabric & the length. the buckles at the waist add a unique look so no belt necessary.,5
"This jacket is my favorite purchase in a while! i used my last month 50th birthday discount on it!
it is of exceptional materials and quality construction. the juxtaposition of the stripes against the beautifully vibrant embroidery on back is stunning! it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! my size medium came in the european size 38. for reference, i am an american size 8-10. 
it is comfortable to wear and can easily accomodate large ful",5
I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer. the shirt in our store was featured in all colors.  i chose the burnt orange color to try on and it is was incredibly soft!  i felt like i was wearing a t-shirt with an easy on and easy off feel. the flow of the shirt allows you to wear out or tuck in.  i paired with teal velvet crops and tucked the shirt in for more structure to the outfit. love!!!,5
"I felt inspired to write a review as soon as i put this on. the vest fits so well, and the thick fabric feels amazing. love the pockets! like the previous reviewer, i feel like i'll be able to wear this with workout clothes or with a dressier outfit. it has an ever so slight racer back, so probably would look weird with sleeveless tops that come all the way to your shoulders, but i can already think about so many ways i want to wear it. the draping in the front also falls really nicely. great bu",5
"With my 5'9', hourglass frame, wider hips and having a baby, i wear normally sizes 10/12 (m/l) in most retailer skirts and dresses. however, with this, i was able to fit into an 8; it just sat higher up and was too form fitting for my liking. here are my thoughts:
_________
pros:
- lots of stretch and comfort.
- pockets! always a plus in my book :)
- will go with any top.
- nice length. fit me as in the model.
- very slimming.
- you could probably go down a size if you are slender with not wide hi",5
"This is a favulous cape...in fact i would buy another if there were other colors! it is oversized, playful, chic, dramatic and simply put a true statement piece. it will not be flattering to your figure...it is not suppose to...but it will show your true sense of style! wish it had pockets...i may add them for more play.",5
"These two blouses are probably my best purchases anywhere in some time. fit is perfect, quality is great and both will be worn many times this summer and into the fall. unique from the all other tops i have seen lately.",5
"This skirt is really cute and versatile, it can be dressed up or down. i paired it with a black chiffon top for a dressed up look and a denim button down for a casual look. the length is good, and the buckles allow it to be tightened, which is a plus if you have an athletic body.",5
"I saw the skirt on a display today at my local store. i was attracted by the colors and the display itself. my thoughts, "" give it a chance"". i bought the size 10 without even trying it on, with the idea that the colors and style had so much potential, i am so pleased with this skirt! the fit is true, although if you like a higher ride on the waist, i would size down. the fabric has just the right amount of stretch to make it super comfortable. i had so many staple items in my wardrobe that i wi",5
"This shirt is exactly what i expected! it is just as cute as on the website and the fit was great! it's the perfect shirt for summer, loose fitting but in a flattering way. the design makes it very versatile since it can be matched with so many colors!

i highly recommend it!",5
"I saw the black in store and had to try on. it is very, very cute. i would say it fits a bit small. i tried my usual medium and while it fit, it was a little short. id take you could take your regular size or size up. i would not size down in this one. adding to my wish list and hoping it sticks around til sale time!",5
"Let it be known that i hate shopping for jeans. i recently had my go-to skinny jeans rip by my back pocket and new i needed to get something new & better stat. i have a pair of black ag sateens that i got a few years ago, and i decided to try out this pair. i got them in the mail yesterday, and i never want to part with them! they are perfection. they hit perfectly on my waist; they're incredibly comfortable and basically make you feel like you're wearing the jean equivalent to yoga pants. they",5
"Was scared at first to order this product, when i tried it on i was amazed on how good it looks. fits just like the model picture, and the material is awesome.",5
"Great dress! wish it came it more colors, would like to buy another one. i am 5'5"",125, size small is perfect. unlike one of the previous reviewers, i do not think it is too clingy. maybe she needed to size up.very versital, cute with a jean jacket, or long lightweight scarf, booties, or sandals! .",5
"This dress is perfect for spring and early summer. it has some weight to it and so it drapes beautifully. it is very well made and the fabric is good quality. the color is a medium color gray; much prettier than in the picture. i wear a small in most retailer dresses and this fit perfectly in a small. it hugs in all the right places and skims from the hips just like in the picture.. the length was just as it looked on the model. i am 5' 5"".",5
This is such a unique and fun dress. i'm so glad i found it and it fits perfectly!,5
"I've passed this dress by a number of times online, but ordered it on a whim on the mothers day promo. based on the reviews, i ordered my regular size, medium. it fit perfectly. i do think the cut is on the trim side, but it isn't tight or fitted. i probably couldn't eat a big meal in this though as it would probably show in this dress. the fabric is buttery soft! the button placket down the front is very clean and lays flat. there are two side pleats that are a different fabric and are ever so",5
"What a unique twist on the traditional cargo jacket! the swing styling on this jacket is so cute---not too full-, you still get a nice silhouette from the front, with the swing in the back this is a fresh take on this staple. it will be a ""go-to"" piece in my closet!! the quality of the material and tailoring on the jacket is wonderful!!! as other reviewers have commented, it does run large. i am exchanging it for a size down. i can't wait to get it in and wear it!",5
"You make classy stuff. this skirt is a nice take on a tweed skirt.
colors: can't tell from the picture, but there is red and pink thread as part of the tweed, very fun and happy, yet appropriate colors for fall and winter. the cut is very flattering, the scallop part is interesting though, it is sown at one part of the skirt, in the middle, not sure why. i ordered the 0p, and that fit me like a glove. (26.5 in waist, 35-36 in hips, 115 lbs).

length on the petite was above the knee, like show",5
"I tried these on at the store and thought the color, texture and style was very nice, but i needed the petite length. so i came online but was disappointed to see that the style is sold out in petite! darn. the regular length hits me just above the ankle, so i suppose it is still do-able, but i hate to pay full price for something that doesn't fit quite right. maybe if it goes on sale i will consider it.",5
"Love the blue color. is a bit short, but fine with a tank underneath. i purchased the small, that's what i usually wear.",5
"This jacket is perfect! the crop length is just right! not to short and the way it is cut longer in the back it really paints a beautiful silhouette on my larger frame. i'm a a 12 typically but broad in the shoulders and larger in the bust 36dd. this jacket is loose fitting and roomy. i could probably have gone with a large, but i'm really happy with the xl as i can layer underneath and it's just super roomy and comfy. the quality of this jacket is great. it will be a staple for years to come. i",5
"I love this top. i got a medium in black on sale. i am 5'8'' and 135lbs. the medium fits great. the medium is slightly loose on me through the tummy, which is nice - in my experience, it is not too constraining, contrary to other reviews. however, i think it depends on your body shape; i am a coke-bottle. this will be a wardrobe staple for day to day and going out; note, it is too low-cut for work wear. very happy with my purchase.",5
These are some of my favorite new pants. i am never disappointed by the quality from this brand and they are super comfortable and adorable. a definite must have!,5
"I'm surprised by the negative reviews and i'm here to come to its defense! i love this dress! i'm solidly a 0 petite in tracy reese and this fit perfectly. the top isn't snug but it's not roomy enough to say it runs large. just perfectly comfortable. the belt was a little tricky because it has to thread through several loops, but it stays put nicely and fit perfectly without being too snug or uncomfortable. the fitted top with the belt offsets the fit and flare style of the skirt. lace is beauti",5
"Received december 23 and 83 degrees in louisiana but weather can change from hot to cold in an hour. this sweater is so soft, so cozy, i'm ready to run the air conditioning! beautiful styling, well-made, and has a generous fit that you may or may not prefer. this will be one of my very favorite garments . luxurious, and i deserve it. i ordered a large, have long arms, and the sleeves do come over hand as shown in photo. it is very loose and flows over my jeans. i am an extremely difficult to ple",5
"Absolutely love, love this dress. it is so comfortable and falls perfectly. the material is great and you can dress it up or wear it casually. if it had more colors, i would get it it in any color it came in!!",5
"I bought this dress with my birthday gift and i do not regret it! it's so soft and feels like pure comfort but the details, little metal buttons down the front, the vent pleats on the side; make it feel special. i received many compliments and i would urge you to get this one if you are seeking comfort. it was pretty true to size and because i'm an average height i wore a small block heel with it.",5
"After reading the reviews about this top being really clingy, i decided to order up a size and purchased a medium. when i took it out of the box today and held it up it looked huge and i thought i had made a mistake. however when i tried it on it actually fit really well! i could see if i had ordered my usual small how it would have clinged to my body in a unflattering way. very happy with the top and thankful for the reviews.",5
"Great pair of pants to wear to work, and interview or out to lunch. i got so many compliments the first time i wore these. i'm 5'2"" i ordered the burgundy color in a size 0, regular which is what i normally wear and they fit fine. however they were just a tad big in the waist and a tad tight around my calves but other that they're a great pattern pant to have you wont be disappointed!",5
"This dress did not impress me when i was browsing the website online. when i went to a store, though, the colors struck me as really vibrant and earthy, and i wanted to give it a chance. i tried it on and it fit like a glow! i am a 5'1'', 100 pounds, and got an xxs p which was a perfect fit. the length was great for me (petite size) and did not need altering. the online photo may not do justice to the little details on this dress. definitely a very high quality dress that i would categorize as a",5
Love this top. very easy to wear to lunch or site seeing. the fabric is soft and drapes nicely.,5
"I wanted this top ever since i saw it online, it is so me. it's a nice mix of feminine and masculine, you can pair it with a nice pair of jeans or even business pants to dress it up. this will make the perfect summer shirt and it hangs so nicely! i highly recommend this shirt, i would get it before its gone!",5
"I love sundry clothing. this lightweight fleece is the perfect weight. it keeps you warm enough when it's cold, but not hot when it is milder. it's super soft with nice embroidery. size 1 is a great fit for my 5'1"" frame. wear it to hang at home or to go out.",5
Love these pants. the design is totally different and that is what i love! i paired these with the velvet red shoes from this site - also on sale. for me these ran true to size.,5
"If you care that it's sheer- be forewarned. i probably won't wear a cami under it, as it's not terrible, but worth noting. that said, its lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer and its design is gorgeous boho at its best. it's cut quite generously and i do wish i'd gone down a size.",5
"So comfortable, great fit, dress it up with wedges, down with flats,
extremely soft and flattering. i normally wear a xs/s and the small fit perfectly. i'm 5'6"" and the length is just slightly cropped.",5
"I just purchased these pants in red on sale. i am 5/5"", 143 pounds, and the 10 fit perfectly (i am either an 8 or a 10 in pants, depending upon brand). it is really hard for me to find pants that are cute, unique, work-appropriate, and flattering. these pants fit the bill in all aspects. i thought i would prefer the black, but am really glad i got the red.",5
"Great dress, fit perfectly warm for the winter, i live in florida it will be great if we get a winter next year. very comfortable and easy to wear.",5
"Being somewhat on the 'fluffy' side, the style is very flattering and forgiving and will be ideal for summer. i am between a size 14 and a 16 and the 14 fits perfectly. light and airy a very nice, simple embroidery in contrasting color. very chic in an effortless way. the armholes are just right--not too big! the color is definitely a creamy ivory. worth the cost because i don't think it will be available for too long.",5
I loved the jumpsuit but unfortunately had to return it due to running a little on the small size.,5
"I love these pants! beautiful quality material, soft on the skin. fits well. definitely a tailored fit. true to size. unique design, and really fun!
i am 5 foot 5, and weigh 132 lbs. i am apple shaped, so i was worried these would be too tight around the hips, but they aren't .",5
"I love this romper!  i am 5'2 and the medium fit great and wasn't long.  i'm short so i thought i would have to hem this!  it's comfortable and, although, i'm not a huge fan of gauze, the fit was perfect.  i had to
snatch it!",5
"However, i unfortunately followed others advice saying these run small. i had to return/ exchange to a 00p. in turn had to give up the sassy red and settle for black. although they are beautiful trousers in black as well...",5
"Received this shirt yesterday and loved it. doesn't look that great online in pics, but it is a unique and beautiful top. the material is a substantial woven cotton so it lays nicely and keeps its shape . i am 5'5 and 128lbs and a small bust size 34a , i usually wear small in shirts but since it is a longer length i didn't want it to tight around my butt.... i am curvy in that area size 6 pants....i ordered the medium and i am so glad i did .. it lifts just like on the model...the only downfall",5
"This dress is absolutely amazing! i am an retailer addict, a good portion of my wardrobe is from retailer. that being said, this is one of my all time favorite purchases! this dress is a beautiful statement. i am tall and curvy and this dress fits like a glove but is very comfortable. the quality of the beading and the fabric is very good. i wore it on my hawaii vacation, and got numerous compliments! don't pass this one up! five stars!",5
"These pants are fantastic! the pattern alone is to die for, but they also have just the right amount of stretch for the perfect fit! i received so many compliments when i wore them i felt like a rock star!",5
"Bought these in 2p and i'm normally 0p in most pants. for reference, i'm 5'1 and 107 lbs and the 2 fit perfect! got many compliments on these pants",5
This jumpsuit is great. i recently had a baby and am still trying to get the last 10 lbs of baby weight off and this jumpsuit is very forgiving and super comfortable. i'm usually a medium & i wasn't sure if i should size up. i ordered the medium and it was the right choice. great light material for summer and nice neckline.,5
I bought this today in a size 2. fits perfect. i am normally a 0 or 2 or xs. the top looks and fits exactly like the picture if you are small chested. because it is not long in the front. i think if you are larger chested the top will stick out too much and be too short in front. it is not super voluminous in front which is a good thing. it does have the volume in the back which gives it a cute shape. it is on the shorter side. very nice material and design as well as details. overall good pick.,5
This dress is absolutely beautiful! it fits like a glove and the material is super soft. so in love with this! i'm 5'2'm and normally a xs/s. the xspwas a better fit in the waist and chest. the arm holes were a bit tighter on me. the sp was way too large.,5
"I tried on this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love! i'm a bigger gal who is busty and have wider hips. this dress made me look and feel slimmer, and is light to wear. the dress is a perfect length too. i'm 5'11 and this dress hits me right at the ankles. if your looking for a long dress to wear that can be either formal or casual, this one is perfect!",5
"I decided to try this on just for fun because the colors and design are absolutely gorgeous. here are my thoughts:
_________________
pros:
- the jeweled neckline is lovely! it really helps set the dress apart.
- pockets!!! such an elegant dress to have pockets is a huge plus in my book. :)
- the length is ideal for taller folk.
- it swings beautifully on the body and flares out quite a bit on the bottom. if you're tall as i am, this won't be an issue.
- nicely conservative at the top.

cons:
- i",5
Beautiful colors,5
This is one of my favorite tops i've ordered. flowing and relaxed with great details at the neck. i get compliments every time i wear it.,5
"This dress is stunning! my sister-in-law was hoping to use it as a bridesmaid dress for her wedding and i ordered it for fitting purposes. it fit beautifully on my 5'10"" frame. unfortunately she decided against it due to availability and because of the length on the shorter bridesmaids. while it fell to a couple inches above my ankles, it made the shorter girls look shorter. i ended up returning it but am regretting not keeping it now!",5
"I was a little concerned ordering these online without seeing them in person but they do not disappoint! the fabric has a little texture to it that makes them look and feel like a high quality pant. the design is unique and provides visual appeal, and i still feel like i can wear them in my office without looking out of place. i love the high waist on these!",5
"This skirt is a nice medium weight and is lined. my normal size 4 fit perfect. i only wish it was available in petites. if you are petite, the skirt is ankle length. but this is a good skirt to wear to work.",5
"The beadwork is gorgeous, but the sleeves are so puffy, it looks as though you're wearing shoulder pads. the fabric of the shirt isn't that fabulous either.",1
These trousers are wonderful. the fabric is comfortable and does have a little give to it.,5
"I really wanted to not like the top for that price, but ti looks really good, the beading makes the shirt stunning... i ordered the 0p, not sure what size to get, and it is just fine. the length is almost too short, but isn't. the rest of the shirt fits nicely. the shoulder are wide, like poofing out a bit, perhaps that is hwy some people thought it looked large? the beading work is beautiful also a little sheer, but not crazy. debating whether to keep it but right now i love it. also, teh colla",5
"Very pretty top, comfortable and soft but looks nice enough for work!",5
Normally i am a size 10 or 12 but i sized down to a small. still very swingy and beautiful. i bought the pink and the taupe as well. the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains!,5
I am always looking for a nice denim skirt and this one is great the pale pink is perfect and the stretch is awesome. i wore wedges with it and a nice romantic top and it looked great. i originally got a 8 and a 10 and kept the 8 because of the stretch it fit perfectly. nice length and great quality,5
"I got this top in an xs and the fit is great. the top is a little darker than pictured. it looks great with white, kaki and denim.",5
"I was pleasantly surprised with the fit of this top! at 5' 6"", i'm rather busty, short waisted, and full-figured. i ordered my usual size 16, and the fit is a flattering, 'almost' empire silhouette. i was worried about the back being too long for my body shape, but it works great. the embroidery and construction make this a really special piece.",5
"This skirt is a rare find. slimming, flowing, and best of all, it finally sits on my waist and not on my hips, while hugging the hips in all the right places for the streamlined and sexy look. the fabric is substantial, yet soft, so no weird sticking out sides. the color is delicious very pale-tea-rose, better in person that the picture here, and is fresh for summer. nice length for office. easy to pair with either fitting or loose top/s and jackets. i also got a distressed denim pilcro west to",5
"Extremely disappointed with this top. it runs extremely large. i'm 5'2, 130 lbs, 34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer. i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me. the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all. fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft. unfortunately, i will be returning.",1
"Fabric is soft, body runs a bit big but falls nicely. length is great for leggings or skinny jeans. overall, wonderful tee shirt!",5
"The skirt is a little longer than i expected, it hits me at my calf, i considered having it shorten knee length but believe that may takeaway some of the aesthetic so i'm going to wear it as it. the quality is quite nice and the color is lovely, very feminine. nice skirt for a picnic",5
I tried these on in the store and didn't buy them with the other items in my 'yes' pile. i couldn't stop thinking about them and ended up ordering them. they are so cute. the fabric is a nice weight. they have little stretch.,5
"I was glad that i was able to get this shirt which is really more of a spring/summer item, but i found it wide in the body and the shoulders.",5
"It's hard to go wrong with the charlie's, especially in this fabric, keep them coming!! i wrote a review on the brush strokes as well. they fit pretty true to size, i'd say try both your usual size and one size down as well, they stretch out a little, so if they feel a little tight keep that in mind. because of the texture of these pants you can wear so many more colors than just usual black and white trouser fabric. try wearing a burnt orange, green, or pink (the isabella sinclair grid wrap but",5
Can't go wrong with these new charlie's by cartonnier. they fit amazingly. the fabric is a textured cotton but doesn't seem to wrinkle. just shook them out of the bag yesterday. the fabric description says cotton and spandex so they have some give (just a little) but are not going to stretch out after wearing for an hour. paired it with all sorts of different tops. side zip is slimming. lined pockets. substantial fabric. nothing bad to say. if you haven't tried a pair of charlies you should. you,5
"Ordered the pink in a small, but it ran big...the xs was perfect for my 5'6' medium frame. it is comfortable and the fabric has an interesting texture. looks great with chinos or jeans. might need to get the other color.",5
"This is a really great top. it looks fantastic on. while it is a bigger fit, its so flattering. i get tons of compliments every time i wear it.",5
"I ordered this shirt last week, it's beautiful!!!!! it's even prettier than the photo. i'm 5.3 120lbs ,i ordered the petite 6 and it fit perfectly!!!! i wish it came in more colors, i'd order another one in a minute!",5
"So i actually loved this skirt (the tea rose color and coppery gold buttons were perfect together) and it's rare to find something that's simultaneously so form-fitting and comfortable.... but i hold a lot of my weight in my butt and thighs, and i just felt like it was a little too sexy for work (especially with that long slit - i might feel differently if it didn't have that slit, because then i could at least pair it with a cute oversized cardigan to tone things down a bit for the office). if",5
I love this vest. get compliments every time i wear it. it's stretchy too :). unfortunately i got ranch dressing on it and spot treated it with shout and now the spot is gone but the color faded there. so little tip don't spill on it lol. my fault though so still 5 stars!,5
"This top is everything i wanted it to be. the fabric is beautiful, and the fit is flowy and comfortable. i would love to own a u-neckline version.",5
"I order this sweater in black - size small - and i just love it. i'm a slender 5' 9"" 130 lbs and the small is perfect in for me. while it has the classic cardigan look and a slightly oversized ""boyfriend"" feel to it, the rounded front hem, hip pockets, and buttons that end slightly above the bottom hem (where the rounded hem begins) are unique touches i appreciate and love in retailer's clothing. the weight was slightly heavier than i expected and better quality, but it is perfect for my minneapol",5
"Flattering fit and neckline. too thin to wear without a cami or tank underneath (for me), but i was expecting that. great go-to tee.",5
"I've been looking at these for some time and i finally pulled the trigger. i'm glad i did because these tights are such a fun accessory to add to my wardrobe. they add just enough whimsy to classic dresses and skirts. these are not your everyday thin stretchy tights. they remind me of the tights i would wear in the winter as a little girl; they are really sweater tights. i think this aspect is great, but they do not have as much give as other tights. i am petite, about 5'3"" 112 lbs and the small",5
"I love this top. i am always looking for tops that are comfortable and work as basics. the material is super soft and not too clingy. it feels like pajamas, but looks very polished. i am a little wide in the stomach and bust, but this didn't look boxy. i got these in all 3 colors.",5
"These tights are so cute and can add some fun to any outfit. i paired with a mustard mini, denim shirt and desert boots! they do run small. i am a size 4 and had to get the m/l",5
"I love retailer sweaters, in fact, i believe all my sweaters are from retailer! this cardigan is really nice and i'm so glad i bought it. it will work well with skirts, dresses, pants... it's well made and soft and comfy. highly recommended!",5
The material is cheap and looks torn. not as nice as the picture.,1
"This cardigan runs slightly large as it is boxy, which i love. the color is exactly as pictured and it is soooo soft! can't wait to wear it with a t-shirt and jeans!",5
"I am short, on the heavy side. 5'1"" 156 lbs. i always wear large petite. this beautiful blouse swallows me. lots of fabric on the front side of the shirt, causing a boxy look. i could totally do a mp if not sp. i am going to try and exchange..
beautiful blouse, great quality, breathable fabric. colors are deep and rich. so comfy.. highly recommend.",5
"Adore the rust color in this top. very pretty rust color. would go with a lot of stuff. my only small pet peeve with the shirt is the opening under the hook and eye. i have been wearing a seamless tank underneath. but everything else about the blouse fits so perfect, drapes nicely that i think the opening is a minor thing that a tank top can fix. beautiful on. felt that it fit tts. i'm usually a 34b, got an xs in this top.",5
"I like to have a capsule wardrobe for all seasons so that when i travel, or just for everyday, i have a multitude of options with a few good quality pieces. i am not a fan of 'dry clean only' items, so anything that i can find that i can at least hand wash with good results and is within my color palette and sense of style is always a great find. this light weight cardi can work for multiple seasons easily, it is a tad boxy, but it actually works for me (5'4, 34c, 125 lbs) i can wear it with a c",5
"This is a cute work jacket, as well as paired with jeans.  flattering. very soft.  only con is this is thick with a soft cotton lining, so not great for summer in az, but will get plenty of use this fall. typically 6-8 on the top, i went with medium.  not tight in the arms as other reviewer noted.",5
"This vest is perfect. it is a great layering piece to be worn with jeans, slacks or a skirt. it has a substantial weight without being restrictive. i made the purchase based on the other positive reviews and it was ""love at first sight.""",5
"The material is more like a great tee for the sleeves and the back, so it is so comfortable. i agree with the previous review, i am not thrilled about the hook and eye, but it still looks cute with a tank under it. i bought it in black and i am ordering it as well in white. it looks great with skinny jeans or pants.",5
Such cute tights! i saw them and had to have them. they are a thick knit - very good quality. the color is a dark navy and the little foxes and a nice pop of color. i get lots of compliments on them.,5
I love layering this over basic tees (or graphic ones like the wild west tee) - it adds just the right amount of edge. currently building my pin collection to add on (vintage turquoise and rock music to be exact).,5
"Classic and stylish. trendy with the blocking...rich colors, soft and comfy. i typically wear s and s was perfect. i love this sweater.",5
I love this top!!! i just had a baby and it is difficult to balance classy with comfortable with out looking sloppy. this top is perfect. it may run a tiny bit big but for the most part it is true to size. great for busty girls (36dd).,5
"The color of this top is a bit more vibrant than online. material is light, but i can wear a beige bra underneath and not need a cami. fit was true to size for me and detail at the neckline is flattering. a keeper for me!",5
I had to have this when i saw it in a store. i was drawn to the shape and the neutral colors. i wore it for the first time today with a black tank. on me it looks best unbuttoned. it looks good with pants. the small fit best although the arms are a little tight at the upper arms. i have muscles so i don't think i could wear it with any top with sleeves.,5
"The color is as pictured, like a deep coral. very comfy and great drape.",5
These fox tights are so very cute and fun! how can you not smile when wearing these tights designed with the cutest foxes all over! they are warm too! these go great under dresses or tunics and i always get compliments when wearing them! they are a real attention getter!,5
"I really like this vest. personally, i think it is difficult to find vests that fit properly. this is a good one. fabric and color good. the photo is very representative of the color. no surprises there. arm holes are not too big which is often a problem. the detail on the back gives it some added interest. the only thing i would mention that could be a negative is that it is short, especially in the back. again the picture is representative but do pay attention to the length and be certain that",5
"I didn't pay much attn to this online. i'm not much on front hook & tie closures. well, saw today at the local store & decided to try on both the s & m. i am usually a s in tops, but the m was only a bit more roomy & longer than the s, so i went with the size m. i thought the styling of it paired well w/ the pilcro cord skinnys i had on. looked much better than the pics online. i have other pilcro skinny cords & jeans in vs colors so i think this top will work out well for me. love the 3/4 sleev",5
"Fell in love with this a soon as i saw it in store. it is soft and can eaisly be dressed up or down. wore it to work already and got so many compliments. 
unfortunately when i saw it in store they didn't have it in stock. the very helpful gentlemen at the irvine, ca location checked online but it was sold out in my size. so he checked the stores that carried it. i called one and the mailed it to me. customer service in store is great!",5
"At first, i thought this top was going to be stiff. i am pleasantly surprised by how soft and flowy this blouse is. it's lovely cream color with beautiful lace details. i appreciate the lining inside the bodice which means i can potentially go bra-less when it's hot! i'm 5'2'', 135lb and retailer size s usually gives me plenty of room because i have a small upper body. but i feel this top is slight short on me. that might be because i didn't wear it off-the-shoulder but had it hang from the top of",5
"Perfect jean. these jeans are comfortable, the length is great, and the rise, at least for me, is spot on. my torso is fairly straight - not a lot of the hourglass thing going on - and somehow these jeans feel like they were made for me. thank you pilcro.",5
This is going to be my go to all season. looks great with a sweater dress and boots also looks great with cords!,5
"This skirt was horrible on me. it was loose in the waist, tight in the hips and poofed out like crazy at the tiered part on the bottom. the material also felt cheap and clingy. i guess the fit is tts, but it's hard to tell given how strange the cut was.",1
"I love this and instantly felt sexier when i put it on, yet with the longer sleeves and looseness felt i could wear it casually. 

i will say that i have to often keep adjusting/pulling the top neckline down. it seems to want to revert to above-the-shoulders position. 

the fabric and quality feels nice and it was a great purchase for me!",5
"I just received my duster . i love it! the coat is as pictured. the fabric is medium weight denim with some stretch. it feels like a denim coat that you have worn for years. i'm 5'8"" and the duster hits mid-calf. i'm a curvy size 14-16 and the xl fits perfectly. the only issue that might arise is that the sleeves are long; they fit me perfectly but i have long arms. this will be my new go to coat for fall.",5
A cute top. slightly tight in the upper area. debated returning but decided to keep as the top is unique and i know that i will wear it frequently. aleardy thinking of way to wear all year around! runs small,5
"Unlike the other reviews, i love this skirt. the lining is a nice stretchy material, as is the eyelet overlay, making it a really easy to wear, and comfortable skirt while still looking polished and professional.   
i bought it so that its slim fitting, more like a pencil skirt. 
i've only worn it to work dressed up, with boots, but suspect i'll get a lot of use in the summer with flip flops and a tee shirt. 
i highly recommend it, and think it's a great price. 
it is longer than on the mode",5
"I love panties. i love the prettiest, softest, most adore-worthy panties i can find. these are my favorite boy shorts--i can always put them on and feel pretty. no weird tight spots and the lace has a perfect amount of stretch. im a mom and my body isn't perfect anymore, but these panties give me confidence, with perfect coverage. i choose them more often than any other in my lingerie drawer. my only warning: wash these pretties as delicates, or the lovely lace colors will fade.",5
I'm glad i got this skirt because it's prettier in person than in the picture. fiance loves it so that's a bonus. it's tts although it's longer than shown on the picture. very high quality and looks expensive. i'm very happy with this purchase.,5
"I was out of town when my coat arrived, and was so excited to get home and try it on!!  i haven't worn it yet, but we've now got the weather for it...and i can't wait!  i'm 5'7"" and heavier than i'd like, but the xl fit perfectly!",5
Fits beautifully. perfect for spring and summer. the cut of this skirt gives your figure a wonderful shape. the quality of the material is excellent.  this item is perfect for to dress up for a date night or wear slightly more casually for a brunch.,5
"I love this dress so much. the fabric on top is not something i would have chosen-it is thick and almost an elastic kind of feel. but i have grown to appreciate that since this dress is not amenable to most bras. i think the fabric would be thick enough on top to actually just do without one. otherwise you would have to go with a strapless-and the right kind of strapless, with this dress.

when they say it flares it really does-and much more than i was expecting. the bottom part of the skirt f",5
"Timeless skirt. just don't like the placement of the slit, so maybe i'll sew it up.",5
"I was so excited about this skirt and pairing it with a cute blouse for the warmer weather. as i took out the skirt out of the package and flipped it around, the back has mesh strips that are see through! there is also no lining to go with this skirt. if you go back to the ""back view"" picture on the website and zoom in closely, you can see the model's black underwear.",1
Nice color and cut but runs very big so size down. will need to send back due to on line only. i am hoping one size smaller does the trick.,5
"When i first tried this top on, i didn't like it because the chest just spilled open. i saw it on someone else and it was so flattering i gave it another try. i bought it in both the red and the black, and plan to put a stitch or safety pin through the top to keep it closed. it is very slimming and hides tummy/muffin top issues. i plan to wear it with the stretchy knee length maeve pencil skirts all summer, along with shorts and pants. give this one a try!",5
"This skirt is great to wear to work. nice medium weight. being cotton, it doesn't get to hot. skirt is lined. nice flattering shape. my normal size 4 fit perfect. love the godets. comfortable. doesn't get all wrinkled from sitting. nice royal blue color.",5
"The dress was great! the zipper was just a little tough but over all a very classic, feminine piece.",5
"I thought from the picture this would be a light floaty top. when it arrived, the fabric was a heavy knit and the neckline sagged very low. on me (granted i'm a pear) the bottom layer hugged my tummy and rear in a very unflattering way. the only thing i liked was the color. back it went.",1
Adorable dress. could hardly get the zipper up in my very typical size 4. i will order a 6 and am hoping it will work out!,5
Love love love this skirt. i walked into retailer in august not looking to buy this skirt even though i saw it in the catalog and thought it was cute. once i tried it on i fell in love. i purchased both black and blue. super flattering and true to size. its a must have for sure.,5
"This skirt is everything i love about retailer. the fit, style and quality are amazing. i feel like a am wearing a piece of art. it is so unique and fits perfectly. way to go retailer!!",5
Gorgeous skirt. runs a bit big.  well made. perfect for the office and super comfy.,5
"This is one of the best date night tops i've seen in a while. i'm 5'6, 120 lbs and the xs is perfect. the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice. i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed, but i do that often so i don't see it as a design flaw.",5
"Despite being a knit, this skirt holds its shape and is absolutely perfect. it goes with everything and is extremely comfortable.",5
"Love this shirt, very flattering fit on my pear shape. also accommodates my larger 32dd bust without straining on the buttons. ever so slightly sheer fabric, but no cami needed if wearing a nude bra.",5
"I bought this yesterday and love it. it drapes beautifully. it's a little fancy but versatile enough that you could wear it for semi-casual occasions. the first tier hits at the natural waist, while the second tier hits at about hip height. this is very flattering for the waist, while still being drape-y and a bit loose. i thought this fit a little bigger than to size. i am currently postpartum boobed so i am 5'4"", 135 lbs and 34dd and the s fit great. (i am currently a s in other retailer tops).",5
I have been wanting to incorporate button down blouses into my wardrobe for months but hadn't found any that caught my eye. leave it to retailer to supply the best alternative to a classic look. i love everything from the bottom flare to the way it cinches my waist. i would say this is perfectly appropriate for a business setting while still giving you individual style.,5
"Super flattering! my mom and i both bought this, and we have very different body types. (we both had to size up a bit, as i have a large chest, and she has a large ribcage.) i got a size 10 (i'm normally a size 8), and she got a 12. it was much easier to zip up without bras on, and it seems to have been designed to not need a bra. my mom is pretty short (5""2'), so she's going to get her straps shortened. for reference, i'm about 5'9"". hope this helps!",5
"I bought the grey and white plaid shirt in a large. i'm 165, 36d and the top closes without gaping - even when i push my shoulders back. it's kind of sheer, so will wear a cami underneath. the waist nips in right where it should - giving a trim silhouette. adorable and fun top, without being cutesy. love tylho tops!",5
"Based on previous reviews i ordered this shirt in both a small and medium. i have fairly broad shoulders, and thought i might not fit my usual small (if it helps for reference, i am 5'6"", 123 lbs, and wear a 32c bra). i first tried on the small and didn't even bother opening the medium. i have a hard time finding blouses that fit in the torso without pulling at the bust (i think this is more related to my wide shoulders as opposed to actual bra size). with this blouse the buttons don't pull at a",5
"This top is adorable, especially the grey check. timeless staple, with a modern & cute update. i agree with 2nd reviewer; i don't think this blouse pulls or is tight in the chest. i'm also a 34d, i got a small, it fits perfectly & i wear it all the time - i think it's great for every season. very flattering, the peplum hits at just the right spot and defines the waist. i get compliments all the time. i pair it with cropped sweaters when it's cold. the grey does seem a bit higher quality; the blu",5
"Buy this skit- it's everything that retailer used to be. great pice, work appopriate, and it fits great.",5
Wow im really glad i didn't listen to the negative reviews! in ordered this top in the black and red and i have to say this is one of my favorite tops! the neck line i agree does need to be secured. i wish they would have added a snap. it's fine though as i don't mind sewing it closed. this top is worth it! i'm 5'2 108 lbs and small chested. so for slim girls i think this is perfect!,5
I found this skirt to run tts - i am a size 16 and the bought the xl. it is so soft and comfortable and the colors are so much prettier in person. i paired it with a black turtle neck and black dolce vita booties that i snagged on sale at my local retailer. happy girl!,5
This sweater is comfortable yet still work appropriate. the ruffled shoulders adds a feminine touch.,5
"I love jeans!!! especially this pair. perfect fit, hugs in all the right places. perfect length! worn it 3x already! and it gets better every time you wear it. goes great with a cute too!",5
"This dress is made of a very thick material both on the top and bottom, making it very flattering. lots of compliments!",5
"This shirt was so weird?it does not fit like the photo at all. there seems to be missing a stitch or something at the top as it is wide open until the bottom/where it meets the other layer. i could wear a tank/camisole underneath, but it still just did not fit right. i do not have a large chest, but this was ridiculous. beyond that, the red color was just okay. even though i purchased this on sale, it was not worth the price and i returned.",1
"Right out of the bag, this top didn't really match the one pictured here (it is the right top, though). the fabric was heavy and felt ""damp"" -- the way something feels coming out of the wash. very odd.
and the fit is nothing like what's shown on the model. the ""v"" is not fitted or nicely wrapped (or even tacked in place) -- it was just two loose, droopy pieces so most of my bra was showing no matter how many times i put the pieces back where they belonged (i'm neither ""flat chested"" nor ""busty""",1
I love this dress! perfect for both work and play and can be worn in all seasons thanks to the sleeves.,5
"This skirt caught my eye immediately. i love the beautiful patterns and colors. i'm currently pairing it with a charcoal grey top, which works well. the only slight concern is the material is a little poofy. i still love it, and definitely recommend this standout piece.",5
I was surprised and impressed by how well made this top is. it looks and feels expensive and of good quality. it is a very flattering fit for someone like me who is small on top and wider at the hips area. i look forward to wearing this top all through the fall/winter/holiday seasons!,5
"Beautiful, flattering dress. love that you can where a bra without having to be concerned about straps showing. very happy with purchase. highly recommend.",5
"These are the most comfortable pants i own. i bought them in the gold, green, and gray (which really does look more like a grayish purple). the gold is my favorite - it goes with so many things! i was just checking to see if there were any other colors - would love them in black and a burgundy. i'm about 125 lbs,, 5 foot 7, and the 28 is a perfect fit. the saleswoman warned that they would stretch out, but i haven't found that to be a real problem.",5
"Love these pants! super comfortable, but feel high quality. i am usually a size 2 and the xs fits perfectly.",5
"130 lb, 5'5, 32dd. ordered xs. this dress is a bit outside my normal retailer style, but i love tracy reese designs and it had good reviews so i decided to give it a try. i could not be more pleased with this decision. as some of the other reviewers have said, the dress is very well made. the lining in particular is excellent- it is a soft mesh that prevents the dress from clinging, without adding bulk in the hot summer weather. i typically wear more structured dresses, but the lining on this dres",5
"As most other reviewers stated, the skirt does run a bit large and long. however, it is nothing a tailor can't fix! i plan on getting it taken in to fit higher up on my waist to make it both smaller and hit closer to below my knees rather than mid-calf. the elegance of the skirt can be dressed up or down depending on what top/shoes you pair it with. it feels well made and the coloring is much better in person than in the picture!",5
"I really wanted to like this dress and was so disappointed when it came in the mail. if you have any sort of hips, the light pattern in the middle doesn't do you any favors. this made my hips look soooo wide! and the seaming and gathering in the middle was just off. if it was one continuous piece of fabric it might look better. with the seam, the pattern was cut up and looked pieced together. that just drew too much attention to my stomach and hips. it had to go back.",1
"I love the bohemian look and fell in love when i saw this dress when i saw it online. it's pricey but i am holding on to it because it's really beautiful. i got a medium. i'm 5'2"", medium built. it's just perfect. i'm tempted to get the petite but with petite, the top gets to be too short so i think i'll stick with regular size. my family loved it! the quality and detail in the dress is just gorgeous! you can easily dress this up or down.",5
"I am almost always an xs in bottoms (sz 0-2) but literally couldn't get the stretchy waistband (no zip or fastening) in xs up my hips. in addition, the ""brocade"" is a very lightweight polyestery, tinselly weave--does not suggest quality. as others have noted, it also runs short; i'm 5'3'' and this was a little below knee length on me, not ankle-length. i've had luck with retailer's sale section in the past, including some items that didn't always start off with the best reviews, but have no regret",1
"I love this top! fits true to size. tunic length, thin comfy fabric, adorable subtle print. the perfect top!",5
"This is my first ever review! these pants are 5-star fantastic. ordering additional colors because i love these so much and am finding i want to wear them every day. i initially ordered the bronze color which is superb, just beautiful. i was worried it might be too bright to wear to work, or be a different hue in real life, but they look just like the picture. to my happy surprise they dress up easily. it's a really rich color that i have been able to pull off at work with long sweaters and boot",5
I feel like an indian goddess in this dress! lots of swing to it!,5
"This romper originally caught my eye in the beginning of the summer with the sweet back bow detail. i had originally planned to purchase for a trip to paris in june, but waited until the last minute and my size wasn't immediately available at my local store. i had honestly forgotten about the romper until i noticed it recently in the sale section ... at that price i couldn't pass it up. again it wasn't available in my size at the store location, but they were able to ship it w/in a few days. i p",5
"Love the unique details and neutral color scheme. top is boxy but i liked the way it looked on my 5'2"" 115 lb. frame. it's comfortable and well made. thicker material.  seems to be holding up fine after one washing.  looks great with skinny jeans.  highly recommend!",5
The little details are just beautiful. the embroidery and tassels are so cute. loose fitting just floats over the body. feels very light.,5
"I really loved this top the minute i put it on. read the other reviews but it really worked for me. i am 5'3"", 36dd, athletic build and the m fit perfectly with a nice roomy fit. top will be perfect for my upcoming trip to tahoe. plan to wear with light denim, dark denim, and black cropped denim bottoms. even looks great with a culottes or denim skirt. the weight is really nice and it washed nicely. i washed on delicate, and laid flat to dry. a little pressing and good as new. it has a nice boze",5
Flattering dress that looks great on. the back cut out shows some skin while still covering up a bra. the petite size fits true to size,5
"I really wanted the dark grey, but it has been sold out in my size for many months. i finally ended up with the navy. i think they are much cuter in person, the color nicer also. i think the cuffs have been folded under in some of the pictures of the models making the shape look just a tad odd. i got my usual size, and the fit was perfect. they stretch just enough. i would get the second pair in a heartbeat.",5
"I ordered a petite small. i'm 5'3, 135 lbs and 34b and the length was perfect and the fit was great. like the previous reviews. love you can wear a bra with it.",5
I love this dress so much! i got petite and the length was perfect. it was so soft and so pretty. perfect for a wedding.,5
"Soft, comfy, flattering, just a beautiful dress. it works for any occasion. i can't express how much i love it!",5
"The romper is well made and just plain cute. i bought it the second i saw it and don't regret my impulse buy one bit. 135 5'5"" and the small fit perfectly.",5
"Ordered a l and xl, the sleeves were so tight on both sizes but the rest of the shirt was wide and loose. the tight sleeves were not proportional with the rest of the shirt. both sizes had to be returned.",1
"I'd give this dress 6 stars if i could, it's possibly the best dress i've bought at retailer in 12 years of shopping there.  the fit is fantastic with the ruching around the waist adding camouflage  for anyone with a bit of a tummy. the cross back stamps hide a bra effortlessly (even those wide supportive bra straps that larger cupped women need to wear), the mature rial is soft and silky to the touch, the fit is true to size, the pattern is bohemian and elegant -- not hippy dippy at all. i'm 5'6""",5
I needed a dress to go to a reunion party(not hs) and this fit the bill perfectly. it fits perfectly and its short but not too short. it is a great work dress or change your accessories and its  perfect for out to dinner.,5
"These cords are soft, comfy and my normal size 32 for tts. the length was fine for my 5'9 height. i really like the bronze color, it is almost a yellow.",5
"I can't get enough of maxi dresses and i can't resist tracy reese. this stunning dress caught my eye immediately, but i was worried that the back cut out at the waist would make my backside look flatter. i'm so glad i took the plunge to buy before it sold out. this dress fits perfectly, it's flattering to my figure, the print is beautiful, the fabric and drape do not cling to my figure flaws and i'm just so happy! for sizing reference here are my stats: 5'3"" 140# 36dd and i purchased the medium",5
"True to size. length is perfect for 5'8""-5'9"". soft fabric. not too low cut in the front, but not all covered up either. ruching is subtle and does not add bulk. skirt portion skims curves, neither clinging to them nor poufing out from them. strap design is perfect, covers bra while revealing a touch of skin. comfortable and effortless to wear, very very pretty.",5
"This dress is so pretty. i loved the details on it. the material was ok. would have prefered a softer material so the bottom part of the dress would have been more flattering. unfortunately, it did not fit me right. i'm 5-2"",34c, 28, 37 and the 4p fit ok. it hit just above my knees so the length was fine. what i did not like was that it was a little too loose around my waist making me look pregnant so unfortunately i had to send it back. i'm so sad cause this is a really pretty dress. you can dr",5
"I feel like an indian princess in this dress! it isn't very forgiving, make sure you don't mind showing some skin - but there's some subtle rouching right at the spot where most of us wish we could hide at all times. great colors; boyfriend loves it.",5
"Absolutely love this dress. i saw it online and didn't give it much thought and then saw it in the store and it was amazing. the photos really do not do it justice. the embroarding detail at the bottom is beyond beautiful in person. i agree that if you don't want skin showing you will need a black bra or black cami to over the delegate lace down the front and back of the dress. got this for fall/winter in fl and cannot wait to wear it, perfect holiday party dress!",5
"This dress is my personal introduction to talented indian designer, ranna gill. i just love this gorgeous, free- spirited dress! i bought the regular medium for my 5'1"", 34f, size 8 figure. it works very well. i will want to wear a black cami, as i'm not comfortable with some cleavage showing (maybe 3/4"") and the open lines of lacy, small holes down the front and back. you might not mind showing more skin though and not need a cami. the top is not very see-through, and the skirt is lined. the re",5
"This dress is great, and looks even prettier in person, the colors are more vibrant. the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect. most maxi's are too long on me, but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect. my only complaint is that it is very low cut, which i was unaware of standing up, but when i sat down at a dinner party, well, let's just say i gave everyone a show :(. recommend wearing a cami or something underneath.",5
"I love this shirt. i'm 5' 4"", 110lbs, just had 3rd baby so not into tight fighting clothes at the moment. love the loose yet flattering fit of this shirt. the sleeves are not too tight on me and i love the length.",5
"This dress is so pretty- the colors are vibrant, beautiful pattern, the ruched part in the center hides the tummy!!! the neck line was too low for me, so had to wear a red cami underneath which hid the skin showing parts in the back around the waist. so instead of skin color, it was now red- even more prettier! no body could tell!! got so many compliments!!!",5
I was pleasantly surprised when this arrived. it hangs in a flattering way and the red has a nice soft hue. i couldn't believe what a great deal i got while on sale.,5
"These crops are very well proportioned and fun. the graphic pattern is spot on trend and the unusual silhouette can spice up your pants options.

i am a fan of cartonnier and these particular pants were surprisingly generously cut in comparison to most of the styles i have. i usually need to order cropped pants in tall, but these worked with the regular inseam.",5
"The linen- cotton blend breathes so well for a hot summer day! the design on the waistline is super cute and yes they are a little long in the leg but that can be a plus+ for vertically challenged girls like me. wedges and platforms are perfect to show off the soft drape of the pant legs. now that they're on sale, i'm snatching up other colors, like white and light khaki- already have the seersucker blue pair!",5
I wore this dress to a party once and haven't been able to find an outfit that can top it!,5
"Cute and very soft, but the elastic wasn't sewn in right. i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess. disappointing for more expensive loungewear.",1
"I love these pants! comfortable, light and can be dressed up for work and down for the weekend. the color is a little more saturated in person, but can't really complain about that too much!",5
"As a lazy one, i have to confess i barely leave any reviews even though i rely on the reviews from others to make my online order decision. yes! i owe a big ""thank you"" to anyone who wrote a helpful and honest reviews here :) and thank you!! now it is my time to pay back to the community. this pair of jeans are just perfect - perfect design, perfect fit and perfect material, soft, cozy and hip with a good spirit.. i don't want to take it off once i put on! i am 108 pounds and 5' 3"" ordered size",5
Adorable and amazing quality. true to size. i ordered a 6 and fit perfect.,5
Very nice top. flattering and goes with everything. i bought the medium in the green but would have needed the large in the white as the white was a little see through and showed more of my flaws. i agree with the other reviewer in that this top has good button placement.,5
This shirt has such a fun twist on an otherwise basic jean shirt! i bought this shirt on a whim despite having a closet full of denim shirts... and i'm glad i did! the fabric is the same cloth,5
"I first bought the red & green at the store. when they went on sale bought the blue & ivory. love, love ,love these shirts! they go great with a skirt or jeans. so happy i got them. the fabric is stretchy, but still fits very nicely. what a great buy, hope to see more of this style again.",5
"Iordered hte petite after trying the rregualr size in the store, and i will have to wear heels with the pants... or get them hemmed... the color choices are all great, i wanted navy, but i have a pair of grey ones that look similar, so i deciced on the netural if my size is stil lavaialble in yellow at sale time, i will be grabbing those as well.

i went with 25, my typical size lately (115 lbs)",5

"Finding pants off the rack that fit me is always a challenge - i'm petite (5' 1'), a bit curvy and short-waisted, so many of today's low-rise styles just do not work for me. however, these pants are a better cut and come pretty close to a perfect fit - comfortable and flattering, too. i've actually had pretty good luck with pilcro pants. i always have some gapping in the waist, but it's not much of an issue with these. more than likely whatever top i wear will hide that part. i was advised by th",5
"I absolutely love these pants! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now. i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric. well, these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft. i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy. i love",5
"These are the most comfortable, happening pants i have ever owned! they are extremely flattering and slimming at the waist. i am a size 4 and bought the 4, and they fit perfectly. they are a bit long, but after washing and drying on low, mine shrunk enough that i can wear them with flats or flip flops, and not just heels. my 2 teenage daughters have complimented me on them saying how ""modern"" they look. i bought them in navy and just ordered the grey yesterday. i might go into my local store and",5
"I love these jeans, well,i have not worn them out yet so not sure if they will stretch, but just in terms of fit and cut, i really like them. i normally wear ch or ag in 25 or 26. i got these in 25 and they fit perfectly. i love the stretch, great color, not too thin, very comfie. i was worried about too much flare, but not a problem. they are very long, but i am only 5""2 and i will be hemming them about 8 inches .",5
"I'm an avid retailer shopper.
i bought this dress for my niece, her style tends to run 
bohemian/gothic.
the style, fabric and overall design/quality of this dress, is something i felt she would like (even though the color is not black).
she loves it - perfect fit. she accessorized it with her usual biker/moto jacket,boots, etc.
but it looks awesome on her!",5
"This dress is absolutely beautiful. i was hesitant to purchase it due to the price, but i just couldn't resist. it's so flowy and comfortable. it's quite long on me; i'm 5'5 and have to wear heels so that it doesn't drag, but could easily be fixed with alerations. i wore this to a wedding and received so many compliments.",5
"Kicky looking pants, that i got at a bargain basement steal. i'd be kicking myself if i didn't buy them. can't wait to wear them once it warms up. they'll look great with a lightweight, boxy sweater and flats. i tried on the 4 and the 2 and the 2 is perfect. the fabric has a nice, fluid feel to it. i always swore to my husband i'd never wear plaids, but i guess i lied.",5
"I absolutely love these pants. i got the yellow and it is a beautiful, soft color. the fabric is soft and flowing. i am 5'1"", 102 lb and the 0 petite fit perfectly. some stated they are too long even in petite but i disagree. the patch pockets are darling. don't hesitate to try these pants out!",5
"I am powerless to resist hot air balloons and had to get these the moment they popped up! the pjs are charming and comfortable. the material feels very satiny. it's hard to tell, but there are small white dots in the midst of the champagne colored background. true to size.",5
"These pants are exactly what i expected. true to size and color were perfect! they feel so good to wear and love the detail in the sewing. perfect office attire or night out for dinner. just add a fancier blouse. ta da :)
would highly recommend them.",5
"I will be living in these this summer! i couldn't find them in my local store, so i was pleasantly surprised when i received my grey pair from my online order. the fabric feels so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch and the cut is very complimentary to those of us with athletic thighs. i was so pleased that i bought a black pair and discovered they look adorable with my tall boots and a black boxy sweater. they've already become my ""go to"" pants. everyone should have a fun pair of",5

Gorgeous dress. perfect for something special. paired with black heels. runs a touch large. i normally wear a small (5'6 and 140 pounds) but i'm expecting so i sized up to a medium and it's very roomy. the sleeves do cap out a little too much but it's just so pretty i don't care! def a keeper.,5
"The perfect jeans for daytime and bending down with the kids or dressing up later for night. i love that the cuff isn't sewn, so you can choose to roll them down too. with just the right amount of stretch, they are extremely flattering. they are definitely my new favorite pair this season!",5
"These pants are so great. i am 5'10 and the talls are actually a hair too long. but no complaints! just wish they made every color available in tall. i had been waiting for new colors to get a second pair and was disappointed they are only offered in regular length. but overall these pants are super comfortable and great for work. as far as sizing goes, i wear a 29 in the pilcro cord leggings and wear a 12 in these.",5
"Love all pilcro, this is no exception. very flattering. slim fit but not skin tight. comfy!",5

"I had been looking for a chambray shirt, but am not a fan of the typical button-down style. this shirt is very versatile, but is far more interesting with the lace up neckline. i received multiple compliments the first time i wore it. the material is incredibly soft, but i haven't laundered it yet, so i am not sure how it will holdup.",5
"These pants are flattering and comfortable, plus they are cute, cute, cute. i'm a little too conservative to wear them with a striped top, but with a solid black or ivory/off white top they are perfect. can be work appropriate with a blazer or twin set or ""girlfriends'"" lunch appropriate with a tee or turtleneck. highly recommend",5
"I never write reviews but this dress is so fantastic i felt compelled to write one. it has unbelievably gorgeous detailing, from delicate beading and sequins on the bodice to the three layers of the skirt: slip, floral pattern, pleats. i literally feel like a princess/ greek muse in this dress. can't recommend it enough. true to size; i'm 5'7"" and 133 lb and got a size 4.",5
"This dress looks lovely on the model, but it looks just awful on me!
i am 5'4"" and curvy. the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape. instead of a cap sleeve, it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders. it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space.
the material is nice and the sequins are pretty, but the cut of the dress is unflattering.",1
"These are great quality and hang very nice. tts. i'm 5'6"" and about 130lbs and the 2 fit and hit just above the ankle.",5
I ordered the neutral in a 2p. i had to hem them. i 5' about 110lbs. i wore them to wore. they wore beautifully with some wrinkling to be expected with linen. but they didn't look like i slept in them. i ordered another pair same size right after the first pair came and tried them on to find the fit tighter than the first pair. a bit disappointed. debating if they'll stay or get returned. i see the notes about stretching. overall a nice pant for the money.,5
"I own this shirt in dark green,
navy, and white.
it is perfect. it drapes in such a flattering way, nice weight.
it shows curves in all the right ways but does not fit too snug, emphasizing every flaw.
and finally... the buttons are placed perfectly so that you don't have to choose between extremely conservative or way too provocative (bra showing).
well done!",5
Very cute. i received many compliments when i wore it. fits true to size (petite 2) with some good stretch in it. i am 5'3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model. it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same. but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable. it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like.,5
"I ordered this in a size s, my usual size and it fits great. i love the color, style and fit of the dress. the only criticism i can think of is the braided trim on the skirt hits right at my hip and kind of, ever so slightly, poofs out a bit and i wish it had pockets. other than that it's pretty darn cute and i got it at a great price of under $40. so i will wear it as much as i can until it gets cooler. because of the rich color, i can probably wear with cute sweater and booties into the fall!",5
"This is a great basic t that works with shorts, pants, or a skirt.",5
"So glad i ordered this dress. it fits true to size and is extra soft. i was unsure about the color, but it looks nicer in person. the fabric is a mid weight that hangs nicely. this will go great with leggings or tights and wear into spring.",5
"I've had my eye on this for awhile, glad it was still in stock.  really great deep wine color, soft.  more texture and detail than i had appreciated in the picture.  love.",5
You will love this cardigan. very well made with beautiful details. the sleeves have the same detail as the collar and the back. has darker flecks that will go well with dark pants or cords or jeans. you will love this cardi! wish it came in more springy colors. i only gave it a lower rating for quality because the first one i tried on had a sleeve that was much tighter than the other sleeve. the replacement was fine!!,5
Cute skirt but i agree with the other reviewer. you can't get it on! i tried my skinny daughter tried no go!,1
This is a beautiful sweater! it is not too heavy and the variation in knit from front to back makes not the same old boring sweater. the color is gorgeous.,5
"I just love this dress! the color, the quality, the design - all great! sizing can be tricky however. i sized down due to reading the other reviews, and i'm glad i did - it fits perfectly! this dress does not have a zipper on top, so if you have broad shoulders it might be a little harder to squeeze into.",5
"I purchased this sweet little cami in all three colors (the black for some reason only available to order in store). the fabric is luxurious and smooth to the touch! i've purchased other silk shells by eloise and would say this one runs small. i'm 5'2"" 125lbs 34c and and typically wear an xs at retailer. this tank was too tight in the chest and i sized up to a small which fixed the problem. i can't wait to make my jeans and bomber jackets for fall just a little more special with these babies!",5
"I originally bought this dress in another color back when retailer was doing the 25% off dresses promotion a few months ago. i had seen it on a store associate at my local store and absolutely loved it, but hemmed and hawed at the original price. it was a splurge even at 25% off, but as soon as i put it on i was in love. this dress is so soft. i wore it to see some old friends, and after every hug i received a comment about how unbelievably soft it was! the material is thick enough to have a decen",5
"This shirt is perfect for me. i have very small shoulders, but i am pear shaped. so the flare on the bottom is welcomed for my body type. i bought 2 colors. i have a similar shirt from retailer a few years ago that was multicolor which i wear all the time, so i am thankful they have repeated this design. also i did get this on sale which is a more realistic price for the quality of this shirt.",5
I thought it was only me and immediately assumed i needed to go on a diet when i attempted to put this adorable skirt on. it got stuck at my hips. i'm a very consistent size small in dresses and skirts. i actually thought about putting it on over my head but that was impossible. its going back. now i see the other reviews and am relieved that its the skirt and not me! wish i had read them before purchasing. retailer is going to get a lot of returns on this one.,1
"I ordered this winth some trepidation as the dress looked a bit baggy on the model. i don't typically buy this style of dress because many times, they are unflattering on me. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs, in very good shape. the small was perfect for me. a size up would've resulted in a baggier look. the length is perfect, above my knee; not too short, but short enough so i don't look frumpy. the dress drapes beautifully, and i can wear it with tights and boots now, and capri tights and wedge sandals in",5
"I'm: 34a, 125 lbs, 5'8""
purchased: small

i was going back and forth between xs and s. i decided on small because it fit better in my arms, didn't feel as tight. the xs fit well in the torso area and didn't have as much fabric as the small. the small also had a longer shirt tail. 

if you don't have as much mass in the arms, get the xs. if you have some muscle or extra mass in the arms, it's better to go with the small.",5
"I bought this skirt a month or so ago and only wore it for the first time yesterday. i thought the design was fluid, summer appropriate, and easy like sunday morning. i enjoyed wearing it so much that i went on to the retailer site today to order it in another color. and lo and behold i saw all the reviews on the sizing/fit. i totally respect other reviewers, so i questioned why that had not been my experience when i wore it yesterday, so much so that i went and put it on again, sans issues.i am n",5
"This skirt is beautiful...the color is definitely more a greeny-gold then a true yellow gold...nice quality fabric, has some stretch, big pockets with cute lining, buttons are adorable, perfect knee length, sits higher on the waist. because it's not lined and the pockets are big, the pocket line is visible on my thigh area, so i am going up a size just so i don't see that...if you have less curves, your regular size should be perfect. it has so much character, but it!!",5
"This is a very classy sweater/jacket. it is a beautiful color. i had not even noticed it until it was on sale, and then read all the favorable reviews. it can be dressy or casual as seen in this photo! so glad i got it!",5
I absolutely love this gorgeous cardigan. i will wear it for years to come!!,5
"I adore this dress, the perfect summer dress that you can dress up or down. the color is vibrant and the fabric flows and feels fantastic against your skin. i love that you can still wear a strapless bra with it, but with the adjustable shoulder ties you can have it go as low as you want for a more sexy look. the bottom hem is this super cute fringe, so fun and feminine. and while it is a loose fitting dress i did not feel like my figure was drowned out by the fullness of the fabric. this dress",5
"One of the things i love most about this dress is that the straps are adjustable. you can tie them as loose or tight as you like. like other reviewers mentioned, the color of this dress is vibrant and the fringe at the bottom is the perfect detail retailer is famous for doing! i am 5'5 105 lbs and lately all of the dresses i have been buying at retailer have been xsp. i have never worn petites before, so i don't know if retailer is just making their dresses a little bigger, but i definitely have neede",5
"Yes, this top runs large and it doesn't show your curves, but it's still really cute and fun to wear. i first purchased the beautiful sage color, and after getting compliments, i also ordered the navy version. these tops are easy to wear, have an interesting detail at the neck, and could be layered. cozy, comfortable, stylish. love mine!",5
"This swimsuit is aaaahmazing. seafolly is an australian brand and their sizing is way off, luckily i already own a one piece by them so i knew what size to order. i am usually a 0 or a 2, chest size 34 d, and i ordered a 6 in this and it fits perfectly. taking it out of the package i wasn't sure if it would fit, but it did! the keyhole is pretty open, and the shape of the sides and high neck make some cleavage happen. i got it in black and it's really sohpisticated, but still sexy and cool. i ca",5
I typically wear an xs to s in tops and purchased an xs for a less flowy fit.  this top has a luxurious feel and the green color is really beautiful (more matte than shiny).  perfect piece to wear under a jacket or blazer.,5
Great piece just wish it fit a bit more blousy rather than cami,5
"This top! it is so simple, but so great at the same time! it does run large, and i'm not a skinny girl... but it has a style that is certainly meant to flow away from the body as it goes down. i find the top portion very flattering and the looser bottom section doesn't take away from that. i have been wearing the olive green with fitting dark jeans and a flannel or oversized soft, washed-jean button down shirt over it for the cool spring weather. it's casual, but so comfy. it's great for loungin",5
"Color, style, adjustability, easy fit, flattering!  yes on so many levels!  oh wait it's on sale!  fantastic, magnificent and pretty!  i bought medium and in 39-28-35",5
"What an adorable and frustrating skirt! i'm not a large person: 32d-26-36. and i ordered my normal size small. this is a pull on skirt, and the waist opening could not accommodate either my shoulders or my hips. in most retailer clothes, i'm either a size 2 or 4; i have to agree with the other reviewer. there is no way to put this item on.",1
"This sweater was huge, it hung down to my calves! it also is really bulky and scratchy, it feels as if you are wearing an old wool blanket. i think it is only made for really tall and skinny people. i'm 5'2"" and weigh 120lbs. and i ordered a size s, and i was swimming in it. the fabric is very thick, i may be great if you live in alaska or the arctic. it adds about 20lbs to your body frame.......",1
Fit is tts and comfortable. the color didn't suit mine but if the color works for you then grab it because it's a beauty,5
"I have been searching for a comfortable pair of flared jeans to wear with tennis shoes or flats. i have tried several different brands and these are amazing! they are super soft and comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. the coloring is excellent for the casual look i am going for. the pocket detailing is cute and helps to flatter your bottom. i am 5'2"" so these were very long but nothing a good seamstress can't fix. i will note that cutting of that much of the bottom will reduce som",5
This top is just adorable. i'm usually between an xs and a small and i went with the small and it's a little more roomy. i wanted it to be long enough. the colors are beautiful and it's a must have.,5
Gorgeous linen blend tee. purchased in grey and white. classic timeless staples. fits baggy which i love. for reference i am 32a 5'1 105 lbs. love love love!,5
I loved this top . it is beautiful.,5
The picture doesn't do it justice. i am wearing it right now with cream pants to work with a cardigan i also purchased from retailer and it looks amazing. the fit is true to size. i am large chested but it fit comfortable...i did go up a size so it is a little longer than i like but i think if i had picked my normal size it would have been a little too snug at the chest. still looks amazing. i feel very feminine in this blouse. good quality material.,5
"So stunning, i had to have it for my spring wardrobe! fits true to size and fits well in the bust and is looser on the bottom. the model weara it just as it fits on me. if you have a large bust you may need to size up as the fabric isn't stretchy.",5
"Besides being my favorite color to wear, this dress oozes vintage glamour while not looking like a costume. the fabric is super silky and will need a professional steaming to get out any wrinkles. the fit is not what i'm used to, because it fits in a 1940s type of way, and when i took it to my tailor, she ensured me that it is the perfect fit. the bodice is a bit looser than contemporary pieces, but is perfect for a night out.",5
"These jeans hug in all the right places. the high waist accentuates my body and makes my legs look a mile long! the jeans will need a trip to the tailor to be hemmed, pooling even with my highest heels.",5
"Beautiful dress! perfect mid length dress for the colder months. i tried a size 2 regular first (my normal dress size) but it was a little baggy, so the 0 fit perfectly.",5
The pleats on the bib make this look like something from chloe sevigny's wardrobe on the set of big love. and the shoulders are cut for an offensive lineman.,1
"I absolutely love this dress. i feel it's the perfect year-round piece. looks super cute with boots or booties. even with a cute baggy sweater over it. i am usually a small or medium, depending on brand. i'm a small with this one. and i actually like it worn without the button fastened in the back, it just worked better that way. it is not see-thru, though is a light material. i live in fl so i can wear year round. but up north, with tights and boots, you can too. so worth the price!",5
"I have been hunting for a pair of high rise flares that have significant width at the bottom and these are perfect. i love the vintage silhouette and how they make your legs look a mile long and i adore how they open wide enough to cover my shoes, not to mention being long enough for me to wear a 3.5"" heel and still skim the ground. for reference, i'm 5'8 140lbs with super long legs and straight athletic build. i sized up to a 30 which is usually for me in ag jeans so for the brand, they run tts",5
"Beautiful, unique, colors perfect for winter. i received so many compliments at two holiday parties. and on sale, this is a no-brainer",5
"The picture online doesn't do this pretty dress justice. i'm curvy, and always searching for dresses that don't make me look like a sack of potatoes. its pin tucks at the bust give it a little shape, and the print is much more vibrant in person. will look great with tights and a black blazer for dinners out.",5
"Received this dress yesterday, love it!
my initial hesitation in ordering this dress, even though it is my fav color....was rather bright for sept..
but loved it and decided to order and wear it next spring.
delighted to open the package and see that the dress is much darker than in the pics...more of a jade green.
it is still a summer fabric/style, however the darker color will be perfect for the warmer fall days ahead.
this dress is beautifully made, superior workmanship, and the fabric i",5
"This dress is sure to become one of my favorites! i ordered it online and the colors are even prettier in person; very vivid! it is a little light for the climate where i live right now but, i'm sure that as soon as it gets a little warmer i will be wearing it often. i can't wait!",5
"I absolutely love this dress! i wore it with taupe tights and suede boots and got so many compliments. i have also worn it over leggings, and can see myself wearing it in the warmer months with sandals. even though the material is somewhat thin, i did not have to wear a cami with it. the fabric pattern is really cute!",5
"I love sanctuary clothing. this parka is on the lighter side, good for this mild east coast winter. it is water repellent. the length hits me on my upper thigh and the sleeves are long ( good for longer limbs). i received many compliments.",5
"Very flattering, not too short, beautiful. i'm 5.6, 36d, usually wear m in dresses, wide hips. the 8 fit very nicely.",5
"Finally a white top that is not see through! this tank is very form fitting and flattering, but does not hug too tight. i am neither large nor small breasted and love the way the v-neck fits on me. for reference, i am 5'2, 105#, 32c and i got the xxs.",5
"Very pleasantly surprised by this top! it's looser, but in a flowy not baggy way. i ordered the m. the
vee is just right on me, tasteful but just low enough. love the sleeve length
ordered thinking another black tee , but it's going to be well used,and great for evenings.",5
Gorgeous dress! fits true to size with high quality material. the colors are stunning.,5
"I purchased this dress online after two reviews and i am so glad i did. this is a work of art and beauty and will be my go to dress for spring and summer weddings, special occasions and other events. i am so glad the arms are covered with lace and flowers. this is spectacular.",5
I'm either a medium or large in retailer tops. i was able to wear a medium in this top. the color is vibrant and the material is soft and light. it will be a great spring and summer top. can't wait to wear it.,5
This dress runs large so i sized down. when it arrived i looked at it and thought the fabric was ugly and boring for a dress. it sat there for about two weeks till i tried it on. i love it! it is so comfortable and is so cute how the pockets hang. all it need is some long necklaces or a scarf to complete the look. i get complements on it everytime i wear it. my only complaint is that it peels under the arms a little bit.,5
"This dress is amazing ! the colors in person are so vibrant and yet organic somehow at the same time. perhaps this is because the fabric has a really nice depth and texture to it. i got this dress for a summer wedding and it's casual yet dressy at the same time. 

re: fit - the best thing about this dress - is a fit ! it's so incredibly flattering on, it fits like a glove. it just hugs your figure in the most flattering way, especially if you have an hourglass figure. the fit is true to size -",5
"I'm so happy to add this lovely and unusual dress to my fall wardrobe. i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on. i wear a two or four, depending on the designer, and the two fit me perfectly. another reviewer said it's special occasion only, but i like it so much, i'll wear it more often. with that said, it's a wonderful go-to dress for the holiday season.",5
"This dress is so cute. i love that it has pockets. it looks great with sandels, and also ballet flats. it is airy, and run true to size. i wear a small, and it fit perfect. i even bought the other navy, and cream dress. you will wear this dress over, and over. just roll up the sleeves, and throw it on, and your ready. just love it!!!!",5
"I purchased the green print which has so many patterns and colors which makes this dress have a very interesting look. i love that it has a drop waist because it is so flattering to most body types.the other thing i liked was that this dress came in petite sizes, perfect for me.",5
"I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer. they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch, see, try on and order through the store (which is much appreciated). i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available. the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here.

i mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee",5
"I love this top, wish they had it in more colors, i would buy more!",5
"I purchased this with some hesitation, having read that some people thought it was unflattering. but i couldn't resist the sale price, and i love a low-maintenance work top and doesn't require ironing. this fits the bill perfectly. it's made of high quality fabric, there's a soft inner lining with a side zip closure, and it has a pretty narrow profile so initially i found it a little snug to wiggle into (i got a small), but once on it fit perfectly, and is so flattering i can't imagine why other",5
Should've ordered a larger size. it runs a bit tight around the top and the zipper isn't that helpful.,5
"I'm 5'6 and between 100-105lbs. buying clothes from retailer is always a stuggle because i have a petite frame but i don't fall into the petite height range. i usually order a petite size and just deal with the shorter length, which is hard when you're all limbs. i purchased a 0r and i'm in love with the fit! the top of the dress fits under my arms perfectly! the waist of the dress also hits nicely. usually the waist of regular sized dresses falls below my natural waistline due to my short",5
"I love the ease of this dress. the style can be dressed up or down. the straps are inset a little which doesn't work for every body type. the thin material can get caught and snag easily but otherwise this dress is a simple chic addition to my closet. the length is just right, not too long like some other maxi dresses. the lining underneath ends at the perfect length as well. the top part is lined well so it can be worn with or without a bra. i am normally a 4 or 6 in dresses. the waistband hits",5
"I usually don't even consider this style of shirt, but i was intrigued by its soft fabric and texture. honestly, i love this shirt! it is so flattering and a perfect staple for any closet! i can wait to wear it out and about!",5
"I had my eye on this for a while, and my store finally got it in (in tmie for the 40% off sweaters). too bad hte petite size was already sold out by then, however good thing isthe xs stil lfit me in a nice way. i wil lnever know about petite, decided to jsut purchase as is (they don't have xxs either#. the fit is on hte looser comfortable side. the red color is rich, and the design is subtle, adn will nto fall apart, so it add some interest to an otherwise typical pullover. will look nice with j",5
This is a great dress for those days where you just want to throw something on but still look put together. it hangs so well and feels so comfortable yet it has a style that is a combination of bohemian and part sophisticated . the colors are muted but they work so well. i wear it with flat strap sandals and have also paired it with wedges. i receive tons of compliments and have to make sure my daughter doesn't try to borrow it. would highly recommend.,5
"Love this layering piece! a little low cut for my personal comfort, but a tank underneath works great.",5
"I originally purchased a small after reading some of the reviews. although it did fit, i felt it was just slightly snug across the chest and upper arms. i returned for a medium (my usual size) and it was perfect. it had the same look and flow as what you see in the model pics. i love love love that it is long-sleeved and has pockets!!!!! i went ahead and ordered the other print as well! i wore the first one to work with some knee high boots and got many compliments. highly recommend!",5
Love love love this dress.  fits like a glove. beautiful details. amazing quality. i'm so happy with this dress and know i'll have it for years. :),5
This jacket is gorgeous! the design is visually very interesting. the fabric is light enough that i can wear it to work and keep it on all day.,5
"Love this sweater! the abstract floral design adds an understated romantic touch, the red is a beautiful rich red, and the cotton is super soft and comfy. i've tried it on with pencil skirts and jeans, and it looks great with both. i'm considering buying it in the off white too, but it does have some cons. one is the waist band hits me where it does on the model and if you look closely you can see where the sweater poof out over the band a bit--it does that on me too, unless i turn the band up t",5
"I am totally in love with this sweater!! it is lightweight, comfortable, and very versatile. throw on a pair of jeans and it is casual. throw on dark slacks or a skirt and it is dressy. the design does not become the focus of the sweater but rather takes it up a notch making it a fun piece to wear. the color is not a light red, but rather a rich cabernet wine color. this sweater is well on its way to becoming one of my all time favorites!!",5
"I was very nervous to buy this top, but because it was on such an excellent sale i went for it- tops like this usually end in me showing a ridiculous amount of cleavage or not being able to zip (i am a 32ddd) it past my waist. i ordered a small based on the other reviews and it fits perfectly! the wrap top is perfect and shows off my curves without showing too much. the fabric is very unique and the whole top is lined with a nice nylon/cotton blend so it is very soft and comfortable to wear. def",5
"I tried this on at the store in the regular size it came in and thought maybe it has some potential is i ordered it for me in a petite since that's what i am. i ignored the package when i first got it thinking it wouldn't really look right but omg, it's 100% amazing and flattering. wear it with skinny jeans, leggings, jeggings, whatever and it's just super awesome on dressed up or down. i'd buy this over and over again without a doubt.",5
"I bought this shirt to wear to work (i'm a teacher). this shirt is so amazing. i'm able to pair it with work pants to dress it up, and in denim to dress it down. the cut is incredible, with the peplum waist coming right below my breasts a little above my waist. the length is perfect, and it just seems to create the most perfect shape. the material is high quality, and i just love the fabric texture. it's very soft, and gives a tiny bit of stretch, but not much. i did size up in this shirt (i'm u",5
"I honestly bought this shirt on a whim the other day in my local retailer. i was drawn to the color and the swing. first of all, this shirt is incredibly soft and lightweight. i love the flow of the loose peplum. the straps are nicely placed, because they're wider and accentuate my arms (and cover my bra straps). i love the little v neck detail. it shows a little cleavage when bent or hunched over, but the top stays conservative when truly upright. i wore this shirt 3 days in a row last week, and",5
"Comfortable, relaxed fit. i am very top heavy and the generous cut of this dress worked well!",5
"This top is comfortable and flattering. i really like the simplicity- a wearable basic summer top, with a cute twist, just enough to make it contemporary, but not overstated.",5
"I fell in love with this dress online and went to try on in the store. i'm 5'6, 128 lbs with some boobs, usually a s or size 4. i tried on the s and xs, and ended up buying the xs - and i've never worn an xs in my life. it is long and loose, hanging right at my knees. the body is roomy, and i am thinking of having it taken in a couple of inches at the waist. there is pleating in the front that begins just below my natural waist and extends out to the hips, plus pockets (!!!). the sleeves are lon",5
"This will be a favorite sweater this winter. it has a loose but flattering fit. i purchased the red (a deep rusty red), and it fits me exactly as it does the model pictured...slightly loose but flattering, mid hip, open neckline. you can't tell in the picture, but the neckline is rolled. i am 5'2"", 140 lbs., just a bit fluffy. the small fits me perfectly. i think that you could size down from your regular size if you prefer a closer fit. the sleeves are at the top of my hands, just below the wri",5
Looks great in the picture but when i got this in the mail the fabric was so stiff! shaking it out did nothing-almost like it was dipped in drying glue. i got this for $10 which is so cheap and i still returned it!,1
"I bought this dress in the green. it runs big - i usually take a s and had to return for xs - i am 5'5"" and 125. it flows beautifully and can be dressed up with heels or worn completely casual with flip flops. worth every penny!!",5
"This tank runs very true to size. i ordered my usual size 8, which fits like a glove. couldn't go any smaller. very pretty fabric which is lined above the peplum. i personally like the higher peplum, but it's a personal choice. great purchase!",5
"This was a christmas gift to my sister. she liked it so much she wore it the day after opening it. very cute design, lovely deep red color. only thing to look out for is the potential of fabric to snag - looks like it may do so easily if wearing long jewelry. may run a bit large, but the medium for her well (slightly loose fitting garment). she is 5'7 and would probably wear a large in a typical shirt.",5
"I absolutely adore this shirt!!! the pinkish rosey color is beautiful and ended up being better than i had imagined. i will say that the shirt is a bit more casual than i thought it was going to be, the way it hangs or something..not really sure. nonetheless, it is perfect. can be dressed up or down, which is the best quality to have in any piece of clothing! i can tell i'm going to get a lot of wear out of it.",5
Very versatile top! i feel like i could dress it up or down. fits very nice and the material is soft.,5
"I feel fabulous in this plum and charcoal vest. i am 5/9"" and the m'l is the perfect length and size. i was initially attracted by the external seams (and color) and was delighted with the silhouette and soft structure of the wool blend fabric. it is versatile and yet a kind of signature piece that i will wear with joy. .",5
This will be a great summer staple.  good fit and very comfortable.  may go back and buy another color,5
"This dress is a vintage 20s drop hem style, not meant to be tight to form.  that said, the bottom is loose so may want to size down.  5'2, 145 lbs= s.  i bought the neutral- navy pattern and it is absolutely gorgeus!  hints of peach and beautiful lace detail.  i literally got compliments all day long- from friends and strangers.  i paired it with a dark denim jacket.  absolute must have for sale price.",5
"I purchased this top in the rose and steel blue colors even though the majority of reviews says it shrinks even when you wash per the instructions. i called the local retailer store first to see if it could be returned if this happened and they said yes, no problem. well the reviews are correct. i washed just the rose colored top so i could compare it to the steel blue if it did shrink. i am returning them this evening. i will not take the time or spend the money to dry clean a tank. it is made ve",1
"This dress is very flattering. i am writing a review to share my experience regarding sizing. i am 5'7"" and wear 34a.  i tried on a size 0 that was at the store as a return and there was about a 3 inch gap to get the side zip closed. although i  normally wear a size 2, i ordered size 4 because of my experience with the dress at the store.  the size 4 is slightly big across the bust but looks ok. i think the size 2 would've been too tight.",5
Love this sweater! great for work. very soft and comfortable. color is gorgeous!,5
"I love tiny's aesthetic--sweet, feminine, yet always with a slightly sexy edge. this dress doesn't disappoint! during 90% of the year, i'm always cold. finding cute dresses with long-sleeves is almost as challenging as finding a unicorn. this dress is near casual perfection. i plan to wear it on breezy summer nights on a cruise to greece i have coming up. it would also be a perfect spring/fall dress before the seasons change or could be worn in winder with tights and a cardigan. see, near perfec",5
"I've already worn this dress 4 times and i bought 3 weeks ago. easy to wear, comfortable and flattering. i love and wish it was available it more patterns.",5
"I was really drawn to this burgundy color on this sweater, but wasn't all that impressed with the style. as soon i tried it on, wow it is very flattering. the color is gorgeous, i can see myself using it with jeans, pencil skirts, pants. for reference it does run large, i am usually a x large but i got a large and fits beautifully.",5
"Love this dress! it's even prettier in person. i found the sizing a little bit on the large side, but i read that many others had the opposite problem, particularly in the bust where i'm small/average for my size. even though it's a little big on me, it looks and feels great.",5
This dress is beautiful in person. i am 5'1 and was afraid it would be too long but it was perfect. i only need 2 inch heel and it will be fine.  details on the flowers are really nice. one more plus it machine washable.,5
"I got this coat to throw over slacks at work with the ac, and it's perfect. the picture online is less flattering than in person. found that the medium was too large in shoulders and arm length, small was right for 140lb, 5'8"", typical size 6.",5
"Love the fabric, so soft and comfortable. it gives a very flattering silhouette. love those pants.",5
This dress is so beautiful in person! but the quality was very upsetting. i had two buttons come off before even putting it on. i was so excited to get his dress for my wedding shower and then i couldn't wear it :(,1
"This dress is gorgeous- it's one of those retailer dresses that i find worth the price because of how unique and beautiful it is! i found it to fit tts. although the zipper does take a good tug to get over the fabric seam, it fits perfectly. if you have a bigger chest (d+), i would foresee this dress being too snug. however, i am a c and it fits just right! i wore it to a backyard wedding with flat sandals and simple gold hoops, but i love the idea of styling it with a jacket and some wedges or bo",5
"I am normally a size 4/6p in all things retailer but read the reviews and opted to go petite on the maxi and size up. i went with the 8p and even with a 32d bust, had no trouble zipping and it fit beautifully. the band is a tad loose, but any tighter wouldn't have fit in the bust. this dress hangs beautifully and is incredibly flattering, especially for those of us with an athletic build.",5
"I've received so many complements when i wear this tunic. it's so comfortable and fits great. the fabric is light and feels good against my skin. this is, by far, my most favorite purchase from retailer and i wear it all the time with my leggings. love, love, love this tunic/dress!!",5
"I tried this top on at store and didn't want to buy at full price even though it made my heart skip a beat with how adorable it was. it is even cuter on. so when i saw it finally went on sale and i got an additional 20% off i immediately ordered!!!! it is flowy, comfortable and fun. wore it today layered with a black turtleneck and long black vest.",5
"Tiny are experts at making busy bohemian shirtdresses that look casual but retain a feminine drape.  it skims over my trouble spots without adding bulk.  this is my fourth dress from this label and it does not disappoint.  for my frame and style i chose tts but those of slender & petite builds may want to size down.  for reference i am 5'3"" 140# 36dd.",5
"Love it- super cute. can wear it to work with blazer or out at night. i'm 5'3"" and got a size small, a little shorter in the front but that seems to be style, fits great",5

"I bought this top and it ran huge, i had to get an extra small. well then i wash it according to the instructions and it shrunk horribly! like its so small now my 3 yr old could probably wear it! i'm so sad, i really liked this top....but for it to shrink after one wear is not acceptable.",1
"For me to buy a tank top it better be special and this is. flattering without being skintight, it camouflages that little back bacon you sometimes get from a bra. the v-neck is low and is the same in the back. great length, super soft and the best part is you can wear a bra! i haven't washed this yet, but based on other reviews i'll probably hand wash and air dry. the only issue is the tag flops out every now and then.",5
"This top looks just as it does on the model and it fit just as they said it would. i needed a nice shirt to wear with jeans and camouflage my new-mommy tummy and this was perfect! it's really comfortable and fun, too!",5
"I love everything about this top! the fabric, the color, the fit! great top for spring and summer!",5
I had hopes for this shirt but was disappointed in the fabric...it's very stiff and heavy for a summer blouse. will be returning it.,1
"Another reviewer said it best, ""i love the way this dress makes me feel."" i couldn't agree more. the lines are perfect and effortless. 
with all the different reviews on size, i went into the store to try it on. i am usually always a s or m at retailer and a s fit perfectly. i think sizing down any more takes away from the casual look of the dress. i am 5' 5"", 130, and have a small bust.",5
"I got this in the wine, which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up), the fabric is very nice, medium weight and drapes well. it is a little boxy but would be nice to layer over a button down.",5
Love this. can be a jacket or blazer syle. fits well.,5
"The colors, style and fit were great. this dress you could wear on many different occasions. all around great piece to own!",5
"I ordered my usual size small and it was very large on my 5'5"", 112# frame.  my daughter loved it so she scored.  i ordered another one in xs, perfect though the sleeves run long! i have long arms.  can be dressy or casual.",5
I got the dark purple color of this top and it is perfect! i wear it all the time. it's comfortable and it's cute! plus if it gets cold i can throw a warm sweater on top of it.,5
"This dress looks beautiful on. it's very flattering and comfortable to wear. it runs true to maeve's dress sizing which for me means in these dresses i always get one size larger than what i normally wear. on my 5'3"" height the regular was just above the knee. great for giving you the illusion of the figure you want even if you don't have it naturally !",5
"I absolutely love this tee! i normally don't buy two of the same thing, but i bought it in both black and mauve during a december sale. i ordered a size small, and it fits tts. it can be worn with leggings or skinny jeans/cords. i love pairing it with skinny jeans and boots best. it's very slimming and so soft.",5
"This tee is amazing! it is so soft and comfortable. and is great for those of us who are tall, it has great length! i went with a medium because i didn't want it too tight. i really hope that retailer restocks soon because i want to buy one in every color!",5
Super comfortable!! i am 34 weeks pregnant and i works great for me now and i think it will be perfect post baby also!,5
"Like the other reviewers, this is my new favorite tee. it's so freaking soft, and the ribbon down the back just gives a little added flare. pure+good has been one of my staple brands for basics for a while, and i will definitely be buying more colors in this. the length is perfect for leggings, and it would be cute with jeans too.",5
Cute top and flattering to wear. fits nicely and i'd say true to size. can't wait to wear it.,5
"Well fitting bra, comfortable (not itchy), lace doesn't show through tops.",5
"Purchased in the light grey and was so excited, i wore it the very next day. the back detailing and pocket make it more unique than a regular tee and the fabric is slightly heavy (in a good way) so it hangs beautifully. easily can be dressed up or down. new favorite tee!",5
"Ordered this on a whim while taking advantage of a promotion, and now need one in every color! the weight and cut is perfect for fall/winter/summer - not too heavy, but not sheer/tissue thin; fitted enough to look super cute with leggings or skinny jeans. fabric has a nice quality feel to it - i have similar shirts from the past that have held up well in the wash. i'm anticipating the same with this.",5
Oh my! i love this tee. it is super soft. i love how it doesn't look like a sack with no shape. i can't wait to get more colors. i am tall plus have a long torso and it still is long enough for me so this is definitely a win!,5
Love this shirt. i am 5'8 and have a slender torso and the small fits perfectly. i love that it's long so you can wear it as a single shirt or use it as an extra layer. i also have a grey druzy necklace to dress this puppy up. purchased it in black and this will be a new staple.,5
"This jacket was a gift for my daughter,it fit like a glove and she loved it !",5
"This top is so soft and comfortable. i bought it on sale, so would i have paid $60 for it . . . . not sure. fits true to size, what can i say its a simple top, well made and so soft.",5
I love simplicity in clothing and this tee fits the bill! i put it on and instantly feel basic elegance.,5
"I am 5'10"", 130 pounds. a medium is a perfect fit for me. i love it! not so sheer that i feel that i need to wear a cami underneath, sleeves are long, and it is so, so, so soft. the scoop neck shows just the right amount without being too revealing. i am buying one in every color.",5
Fits great! love soft material. love with skinny jeans brown boots,5
"I bought this dress in a sm for a cruise i'm taking soon. i don't have much of a waist, kind of straight like a board, and this dress is very flattering on my figure. the skirt fits snug and the top drapes nicely over my waist. very pretty and flowy. i bought the multi color stripe dress and the vertical stripes enhance the beauty of the dress.",5
"Comfortable casual, hip. i have the black & white color which is a bit thicker than the other colors which i prefer as i recently had a baby and need a little extra fabric. i wish the fabric was a bit softer but the cut is so flattering there was no way i was sending it back. i wish the other colors were in the same thicker fabric and i would have ordered more. my new go to top. the black ribbon on the back is my favorite part.",5
This is one of the cutest tops i've ever gotten from retailer. the material is very soft and flowing. it fits true to size and hange beautifully. love it. i should have gotten he turquoise one too!,5
Love this shirt. it fits great and can be easily layered!,5
"Agree with the other reviewers. this top is excellent. great length, weight & bounce to it, flattering without being clingy. i'm 5'10"" with a long torso, so i'm always in the market for tops with longer hemlines and decent material without being too tight or clingy. this one i love! i bought it in black, then went back for the turquoise, then two more... if that doesn't tell you what a great shirt this is, i don't know what will.",5
I need one in every color. so super soft.,5
"Got this shirt on sale and i hope they restock so i can buy more. super comfy and flattering at the same time. i have some extra baby weight and it camouflages that well. i'm normally a 6-8 but i'm an 8-10 right now and the medium was perfect. i'm 5'6"" and its plenty long enough to wear with leggings. a great shirt and i'll be sure to watch out for this one to come back. please restock!",5
Easy to wear.  the fabric is super soft and the shape is very flattering.   i really like the shirt hem at the bottom.,5
Love these pajama bottoms. they are so comfortable and the print is fun and unique. i highly recommend. they run true to size and have a great length. they look short on the model but mine are perfect.,5
"I almost never take the time to write reviews but this shirt is amazing... it's a super soft, stretchy, substantial fabric that is incredibly flattering. it falls perfectly and is insanely comfortable. i am 5'5"" 120 lbs and usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops... i went with the xs and it is a perfect fit. love it so much i bought it in 4 colors... i am now completely broke but these shirts will be in constant rotation.",5
"I am so glad i had read the other reviews of this jacket which prompted me to order. great fit and cut with a hint of stretch, nice styling details, great vintage color. i wasn't in love with the price but after receiving the jacket i would gladly pay the price again. will definitely be in my wardrobe rotation for years to come!",5
This shirt looks and feels fabulous. i got black and white and received a ton of compliments. wore with boots and leggings and fun jewelry.,5
This is the perfect casual top to wear alone or layered with a cardigan. love it!,5
"I love joggers, best style to come along in awhile. i think these are well made and i like the fabric. i just wish the leg were cut a bit slimmer but that's just a matter of preference. i definitely like them and will keep and wear.",5
"Beautiful colors. lightweight flannel, so a great pair of sleep pants that can be worn year round. i ordered a s, my typical size, which turned out to be quite large on me. hopefully the xs will fit better.",5
"Although i wish this was not so dark blue for summer, it is the most fabulous cut, super sexy with the tie neckline and love the side pockets... and did i mention the fabric is ridiculously soft? i just wish it was more of a blue denim blue but nonetheless, i could not walk away from the store without this. i am 5'9, 142 lbs and medium fit me perfect for length in the leg.",5
"I purchased this item in the gray heather color and loved it so much i wanted to buy every other color. the fabric was cottony and felt very soft and cushy against my skin, and the gray color was from the combination of black and white fibers. i ordered the light gray and the red online and could not wait for them to arrive. but the other colors were not even in the same material, but a very shiny and synthetic feeling fabric, with just a single color weave that did not have the same feel or tex",1
"I've been looking for a staple long-sleeve tee for a while now, and i think i've found it! i bought this tee in my usual retailer size of medium and the fit is perfect. the material is soft, the cut highlights an hourglass figure without clinging in the wrong places. the sleeves are long enough, which can sometimes be a problem for me. the length is perfect to wear with leggings without being too long. i'll be back for more colors!",5
"I love this top, it's long enough to to wear with leggings and the ribbon in the back really dresses it up. the only negative is that the material pulls easy and only on the space dye color, not the solids but i still love it! for reference i ordered xs and it fits perfectly i am 5'2 125lbs",5
"This dress will unfortunately be returned...so cute online and looks like a sack in person.  runs very large, arm holes are very low.  not flattering.",1
"Just received this and absolutely love it! i tried the vienne cardigan in the store and i assumed this one would fit the same (since online exclusive), which it does. this one though has the whimsical left grey sleeve with trees, a fence and sheep on the sleeve - very cute. it's a traditional knit design with a twist of modern design being the cape style. it is a bit cropped but fits well and the hood lays nicely. there were a few too many stray threads when i received that i needed to cut off.",5
"This shirt is amazing! it's an excellent heavier weight quality t-shirt, but so comfortable. if you are looking for the perfect shirt to pair with your leggings and boots this fall/winter/spring, this is it! i am 5'8"" 136 lbs and this perfectly covers my rump and the small fit perfectly. the band around the wrist is a nice touch, making this a higher quality tee. i am buying more colors.",5
"So soft. this is the best basic tee i've bought in a long time and it fits so nicely on my frame. i'm 5'8"" ans 130 lb, medium bust and got an xs.",5
"This is the most perfect tunic out there. it is comfy, flattering and fits perfect. it can be dressed up or dressed down. definitely worth it to buy in every color!",5
These pants are so comfortable and cute!! you can dress them up or down!,5
"I'd been eyeing this dress since it first appeared online, but when i went to order, there was no petite sizing. then when shopping, i noticed the carbon color in the petite section of my local retailer. i grabbed my usual ps, and although it was okay, i decided to try the xs for comparison. the slightly closer fit made all the difference, suggesting that i had a figure underneath, but not tight anywhere. nice weight to the fabric, it drapes beautifully and the lacing detail is very popular now. a",5
"Exactly what i was looking for. cozy, not too warm, fits comfortably and roomy without looking baggy. the print is beautiful. will definitely be buying more sleepwear from retailer!",5
I saw this top in the store and wanted to try it on but my 18-month-old son was getting cranky so i had to leave. i kept thinking about it and was planning to go back and get it and then i checked online and it was on sale! i purchased the pink and i'm ordering the blue as well. it's very comfortable and i received several compliments when i wore it. i haven't washed it yet but the fabric seems to be sturdy.,5
"I tend to peruse the sale section when i am avoiding my work (quite often). i came across this top, but had never seen it before it was put on sale. i was intrigued by the sleeves, but concerned that the pattern might be too ornate. i was happily surprised when i tried it on. the fabric was thick, which i find highlights curves and hides rolls. the detail was enough that i could dress it up, but not so much that i felt awkward wearing jeans.",5
"These are long, easily wear with skinny jeans, they do not cling and are not see through! the colors are great!",5
"Love this t-shirt! i live in miami and have a 5 month old so i practically live in shorts and t-shirts, and this shirt fits beautifully and adds a little extra pop to your everyday t. love the material too!",5
"I tried this shirt and really loved the feel, and the scalloped sleeves. i have a couple shirts by this brand that also have beautiful embroidery, and i always find myself drawn to their clothing. the fit wasn't too boxy on me, but i'm between m&l, and sized down, so that might have helped. if i didn't have so much of this color in my wardrobe already i probably would have snatched this up!",5
So super soft and comfortable - great to throw on to run errands with ease while still looking stylish - the lace up front makes it more special that just a standard tee shirt dress,5
"The fit and feel of this top is lovely. great shirt to layer. fits great, i get compliments every time i wear it.",5
"I purchased my wife this shirt for christmas and she loved it! the quality of the shirt is amazing and now she wants them in every color! even though she says she's kidding, i really know that she isn't.! :#

the information i fill out #below) is about my wife, not me!",5
This is such an incredible jacket. total show stopper and well worth the investment.,5
I tried this on at the store and had to buy this dress. it's adorable on and the fabric is really soft. very flattering too!,5
"Great dress! i am always looking for knee length dresses that are comfortable and easy to wear. i am really active with my kids and this dress can be worn on a casual day with sandals or dressed up. the fit was flattering for me, although i am not very curvy and could see that it might not flatter all shapes. i am 5'5'' and 120 pounds and the size four fit great.",5
I love these shirts. ordered in 2 colors and they are great with leggings and skinny jeans and scarves. so comfortable and on me a little long but not too long!! the fabric is fabulous and a great weight. one of my favorites for sure.,5
"After reading the reviews, i decided to order this top. i was so pleased, and when i wore it for the first time, i had someone ask me where i got it. it is perfect with leggings because it is long enough to cover my leggings in the front as well as in the back. i want to order it again in different colors.",5
"I very rarely pay full price for anything, let alone this much for a t-shirt. but i actually paid full price for this in two colors. that's how much i love this shirt. the pink and the turquoise are beautiful, and i'm thinking of asking for the mauve for christmas. i love how heavy the weight is, the length of the torso is long enough, the length of the sleeves is actually long enough. i love the ribbon down the back. it's flattering and comfy and perfect. i'm 5'8"", 140lbs, 34b and the small fit",5
"This dress is very clever. fabric is on thicker side so it eliminates any worries about dimples or imperfections. the tie at neck line is effortlessly sexy and not at all trashy as another reviewer felt. you could tie it if you didn't want any cleave, or leave it looser for more casual look. i got the small bc i felt comfortable with a little cling given how forgiving the fabric was. it still showed shape when i walked. i was surprised to like it as much as i did. husband insisted i get it becau",5
"I was excited to receive this top. it looked great online, vibrant colors with the beautiful detail on the sleeves. when i tried it on, the fabric looked and felt cheap. it is not a flowy top. do not recommend it.",1
"Like the previous reviewer stated, it's more like a cape. i'd to call it a cape-digan. style: super comfy, loose fit for comfort. fabric: high quality, just right thickness (not too thick, not too thin), snuggly soft, doesn't pill with wear. design: totally retailer cute and quirkiness, top of the back has the same gray as the sleeve for continuity, and the sleeve has sheep and a fence (how cute is that!). this is a very versatile sweater, goes with everything, and so comfortable that i reach for",5
"Currently own this in 5 colors after originally buying one. i'm 5'10"" normally wear a medium, bought a small in this. best material and fit overall, perfect length for long torso",5
"I definitely would recommend this top. when i put it on i felt it was true to size, and fit me very well. sometimes my retailer tops tend to be a little roomy, but not in this case. the fit was very nice and its embroidery details make it a special look that i can throw on with my jeans and still look put together. i know this will be a top i wear often.",5
"This is my first demin jacket ever as all the ones i ever tried were too stiff, and far too boxy and long on me. i need to thank all the reviewers who helped me take the plunge.
.
got the size xs regular which is only slightly snug at bust when buttoned and a tiny bit long in the arm for me (5'2"", currently 33-25-37 with narrow shoulders and torso). very flattering look. if this jacket comes out in a new darker wash version i will definitely also try a petite size s.
.
the one i got in the mail",5
"I bought this top on sale - very glad i did not pay full price for it! i wash everything before i wear it. when it dried i saw that there was a grease spot on the back and a small hole on one upper arm - i will probably be able to take care of the grease spot, but the hole will be a little trickier, as the material is kind of filmy.",1
"I ordered these joggers in holly size m. for reference, i am 5'5, 138 lbs, i have a small waist with *thicker* thighs and bum. i was worried that these would make all my ""flaws"" stand out as so many joggers in the past have, but these are not that way at all! they are so comfy and just right! they could easily be dressed up or down. these joggers could quickly replace your everyday jeans or black leggings habit to add a new, more stylish twist!",5
"This skirt is perfect-it can be dressed up or down depending on what you wear with it. it is a thick fabric so it keeps you warm (being a freeze baby i really like that). while the fabric is thick, it is soft, and it is moveable rather than being super stuff. it is not at all itchy. it is a little longer than i would prefer in a pencil skirt but i ended up keeping it anyway. this was somewhat compounded with the fact that i did end up sizing up on this dress. my normal size tending to stay at my",5
"Love this top!!
great colors and fits great
reasonably priced",5
"This sweater is so soft and warm and i love it with the matching leggings. i say it is true to size, however i ordered it a size up so that it covers the bottom/crotch area when i am wearing the leggings. normally wear an xs, ordered a small and it works well. it is very well made. i absolutely love it!",5
So comfortable and warm! so nice to lounge in a cold day and be cute!,5
"Ordered online and love it,exchanging however from s to m 'cos the fit is so perfect and i want to allow for extra room at the festive season:)",5
"I found this top to run very large. i wear a medium in most retailer tops but often a large in other brands, i had to return this for a small. it was worth the effort however, extremely cute top that i can see wearing on its own or under a blazer for a night out.",5
"I saw the two star review and wanted to share my opinion. i saw this item that had been returned to a store and i love it. the fabric is a bit sheer and i think will require a nude tank underneath, but i think it's adorable. don't be scared away by the review below!",5
"This sweater is actually so cute on, i had no idea, nut decided to try it on, since it was on sale. what a msitake, i had to actually buy it!

the grey part is very soft and warm, the design part is nice and
flattering. nothing wrong with this sweeater!

note: i a,m petite (5 foot 1.5 inches) and decided to buy the regular size for longer length...",5
"Love this sweater. bought this with the matching leggings. couldn't be more comfortable. cozy fabric. cute details. loving them both. please bring more of the same in different colors, patterns.",5
"I like having lightweight summer pajamas, and these are perfect. the print is so much cuter in person and the fabric is wonderfully silky. the pants themselves seemed to run a little bit small. i ordered them in xs and s and ended up keeping the small. overall a great purchase.",5
"So cozy and warm, great for the cold nights!",5
I found this blouse to be just a lovely spring and summer top. the netting in back adds interest and the dusky peach floral print is extremely pretty. the tiered layers add a slimming effect and it can be worn casual or for dress. it could even be worn in the fall with the right sweater. i just love it and feel so feminine when i wear it.,5
"I had to write a review on this one because i am obsessed with it, it is the softest and yummiest sweater ever and i plan on wearing it constantly!",5
This pullover is great for lounging! so warm and cozy!,5
"I love this dress! i would definitely accessorize with a belt. my body type fits best in this style of dress because i don't have a big bust size, if you do i would try it on first. for being shorter, 5'3"", i love the length.",5
"This multi-season dress fits beautifully, the colors are vibrant and the skirt has a nice weight, drape and swing to it. the skirt is slightly asymmetrical as some reviewers noted but it's probably not noticeable to anyone but the wearer.",5
"I bought this dress to wear to a wedding and it is a stunner! really one of the most gorgeous dresses i've ever owned. it is very very fancy and really i'd say most appropriate for a black tie event, an evening wedding or a mother of the bride or groom. superb quality... just amazing! i have a few bryon lars dresses and this one seems to run about true to size. the others i own seem to run a little large.",5
"I ordered the purple color and the first time i wore it, i received multiple compliments on it.  i noticed in the prior reviews that it runs big so i ordered an extra small instead of my usual small.  it fits well other than the two buttons at the top of the neck are very small and difficult to button.  i'm tempted to order the red color.",5
"The dress looks great both in winter and summer, either paired with tights and a light jacket or on its own. it runs true to size--was able to buy it online. the fabric is great for all day wear--doesn't wrinkle too much.

the only con is that the darts over the breasts are a little pointy for my taste, but i still love the dress.",5
"I got some nice things for christmas but this (along with the matching leggings) was hands down my absolute favorite gift! so stylish, so cozy, the perfect length to cover your bottom, the perfect fit (38dd and ordered an xl), love the pockets, i could go on and on. the perfect set to lounge around the house in. sleeves are a bit long so i had to fold them. when i say it is ""the perfect fit"" it is oversized (not huge) but it is roomy and that's how i like it as loungewear.",5
"Looks great with skinny jeans, leggings, trouser/ wide leg. good length for a flattering look. longer in front on me than on model.... so soft. doesn't cling. not overwhelming because the sleeves are skinny and drape is narrow.",5
"This is a beautiful top. i purchased this in the green/moss color. it's reminds me of a vintage looking blue-green. it fits generously, has more of a swing style to it. i love it! i think it is romantic and feminine. glad i made the purchase. simply beautiful.",5
Very pretty design. hugs the body correctly. it's a little tight in the chest for me - i'm a 34c (large c) and i have some back chub so i'm using this fact to motivate me to get in shape for the spring. keeping the dress and hoping for a better fit in a few months.,5
What a pleasant surprise! hugs in all the right places and a nice substantial material!,5
"I am 5'8"", about 140, athletic build. i purchased this dress for business meetings and such. i was worried the dress was going to be too low cut but i  am small chested so i can wear lower cuts without exploding out of it. luckily this is the case here too! the dress has a professionally sexy look which i love. nice fabric, good quality. happy i bought it!",5
This dress has become a favorite in my rotation. the cut and print flatter my body and accentuate my waist. the print is subtle enough to pair with bold accessories.,5
"Perfect fit, great material, torn in just the right places. can't wait to see the stevie jeans for the fall esp. in corduroy!",5
"I am 5'3"" 130lb and i bought this dress in a petite small which fit perfectly. the dress hugs my figure nicely. 
unfortunately, i found that the neckline is cut a bit too low to wear to work, at least for my own comfort level, but i just wear a camisole underneath it for work and without for a date. i was really pleased with the purchase of the dress.",5
"Adorable, well-made skirt! lined and very slimming. i had to size up b/c it runs a bit snug around the waist. however, it's worth it b/c this will match many long and short sleeve tops!",5
Love the asymmetrical hem. waist fit snugly as in perfectly. it ties in two spots with a hidden zipper as well. a little stiff in the fabric. classic colors but decided not to keep only because i didn't feel like we could wear it all year round.  can't petite or 0p was great (115 lbs),5
Great pants! i love the style and fit! would highly recommend!,5
"I love this top! yes, it is quite transparent, but just needs a light colored cami (i like the reversible scoop and v-neck tanks at retailer)! it's incredibly soft and light for summer time. the black motif is more like a slate gray contemporary pattern. i also really like the sewn in v-neck line. it gives the shirt a more professional touch. i'll be wearing it for work with a dark blue blazer.",5
I'm so sick of all workout tops being baggy. they look sloppy on my frame. this top is ultra soft and fits great! the black/white one looks more heathered grey in person. i ordered an xs as all tops lately are just huge on me. i should be a small and i will be returning for that proper size.,5
This is a great sweater/poncho. is a little short so i wear a t shirt underneath. great color and looks good with black pants or skinny jeans.,5
I love this dress! it fits me so well and is extremely comfortable. i can't wait until it gets a little warmer so i can wear it with a trench and cute flats or heeled sandals.,5
"Surprisingly versatile and figure flattering without being too clingy and revealing like so many ""bandage"" dresses. the navy color softens the stripes. great piece for travel as it is light and does not wrinkle. i am 5'7"" and 125 lbs. with a smaller chest and curvy hips. the small fits perfectly.",5
Beautiful fit and true to size. highly recommend. they are long and you will need to have them hemmed but they are soft and feel amazing on.,5
"Love this skirt, beautiful fabric and lined. looks great with a tailored jean jacket by pilcro or the window pain patterned retailer cartonnier jacket. i chose the size 8 though a little snug in the waist it fit better than the size 10. i am 150 lbs and 5'4 inches and curvy with small waist but curvy hips with a tush so this cut is perfect for my shape. i love the asymmetrical design with how the skirt will partial zip and the fabric attachment underneath with hidden button. love the edgy look. so",5
I am usually drawn to more color but the vertical and horizontal lines of this dress made me curious. the fit is absolutely incredible! i like the fact that it is very easy to put on without any zippers or buttons as well. it hugs your body in all the right places. i had no issue with the dress riding up and the way the designer placed the lines makes this one even more flattering. gorgeous dress!!,5
"I love this top!!!! the design, quality, and look are all insanely gorgeous. i got this top during the 20% off tops promo, which helped so much with the cost, and i was trying to use up a store credit i had on something of high quality. (after going through a whirlwind of exchanges that resulted in much disappointment.) i couldn't be more thrilled with this choice! it is so flattering on, beautiful color and cut. the only complaint i have is slightly minor, and it's in relation to the hidden bac",5
"I agree with the other reviewer who said there was too much hardware and such. this really does have a lot going on. i usually wear a 4 in skirts, and based on reviews, went up one size. it still saw way up near my chest - i think even an 8 would be too small! it's sooooo tiny at the waist. probably buy 2 sizes, 2 and 3 sizes up from your own. also, the skirt flares super wide at the sides, it doesn't sit the way in the photo or maybe the model is holding it down with her hand. it's like a skirt",1
"I bought the color ""black motif""although the markings look more dark purple and are similar to tie dyed coloring which is one of the things i love about this top. the fabric is so soft and i love the way the neckline falls. it is slightly sheer so may want to wear camisole underneath. personally i'm fine without it. looks great with jeans. i also tried it on in the ""blue motif"" which is the stripe version but found nothing special about that one.",5
If you have an hourglass figure this dress accentuates your curves. i do need to wear a tank underneath as dress is low cut.,5
"I liked the understated colors of this dress, so i decided to try it on. i did not expect it to fit so well! i'm 5'3"" with a large bust and large hips. the dress was super slimming and flattering, it skimmed my figure as if it was made for me. the only thing i'd have to fix is the shoulder straps being just a smidge too long, but i'm used to that with my height. the straps are positioned perfectly, my bra straps didn't even show. the material is very thin and light.",5
"First off, i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix, a white cami, the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper.",5
"Love these! i'm a big fan of ag stevie jeans and these are no exception. the mid rise is terrific and the distressing is cute without being crazy. i like how the holes are not at the knees, which can be annoying when bending your legs. i would love to see these offered in a darker rinse and also in a cropped length. fit is perfect on these - fun and flattering! keep the stevies coming retailer!",5
"I fell in love with this vest  the minute i saw it on the hanger.  it runs true to size and the material is excellent quality .  it looks great with jeans and a tee and also something dressier. i wore it over a navy blue wide-leg jumpsuit, and it looked truly amazing!  i  received so many compliments!  i also purchased the lace tie up top that it is featured with and can't wait for that to come in.",5
"This is a beautiful color top! it can be dressy or casual but the design is spectacular!
i paired it with one of the new retailer pencil skirts and everyone in the store looked it!
i wish they had other colors!!!!!!",5
"Love this vest- it's so chic and pairs with so much.  i have it in the army green and it's prefect to wear over a romper or white jeans and top.   it's great.   i am about 5'2"" and an typically a small top-  the small was much to big but the xs was perfect. i would consider trying to size down if you are uncertain. i am very happy with my purchase!",5
These pants fit great!! i ordered my normal medium and they fit perfectly. i was worried that they may look too much like pajamas and lot look right with my stomach but no issues there. i think i will get a lot of use out of these!,5
"I love this vest, bought it in green and want to order white. its very flattering, and i wore it with a black tank top, ripped faded stevie cropped jeans, and gold gladiators. i would like to mention the care. i dripped something on the lapel, so i tried cleaning it off with a wet towel. it made a lighter mark, so i washed as recommended in cold water on gentle in the machine. i hung it to dry, and it dried stiff and a little wrinkled so i threw it in the dryer to soften it up. it lightened up a",5
Wore it to an interview. the color is fantastic. it's beautiful and artsy. highly recommend!,5
"I fell in love with this in the store. i am petite at 5'3"" and 110 lbs and i went with the regular size 0. i agree with another reviewer that the petite sizing would have been too short. the color is rich, the quality is fabulous and i love the style. it is not fitted, but i also found that it wasn't too wide either. if you're looking for a fitted top, this wouldn't be the one. but if you love a well-styled top with a bit of volume that you can rock with a pair of skinnies to balance it out, the",5
"I ordered both colors in size xl and they're each now favorite purchases. the fit is true to size--it matches the photos. the orange/white/brown/red combo works great with the orange version of the indra tassel necklace.

the tops are sheer so i wear a tank underneath. the green floral version will have some variations because of pattern placement. both are so unique & charming! i've been pairing them with different retailer cardigans & necklaces. they've washed well too--in a mesh bag on gentle &",5
"I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering, i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open, as pictured, tied one button, and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.

i debated getting my usual xs petite, but hey, they don't make it in petite, and the stylist thought the loo",5
These are a great casual workday pant. the loose fit and light weight material makes it a great summer option.,5
"I went out on a limb ordering this romper. it's not really in my ""wheelhouse"" the whole romper thing. but it was a home run! i was afraid it might look too young and that i couldn't ""pull it off,"" but the long sleeves and overall style was perfect. and my twenty something nieces were obsessed with it as well. as far as fit, i'm 5'7"" 134lbs and ordered a size 4. i have a long torso and was concerned because some people said it ran short there, but i didn't have any trouble with that. i just took",5
I saw both of these blouses several months earlier and anxiously waited for them to go on sale. definitely worth the wait. the quality and designs are superb true to size,5
"I love this so so much. i'm 5'1"" with a short torso and post baby 34d boobs. the 6 petite is perfect. it's the first romper i found that fits me in the crotch, height, and leg area. so excited to wear this!",5
"I ordered these in the neutral and the fabric and construction are everything i hoped they would be. they are a lovely light weight rayon that i think will be very comfortable in hot weather. the printed fabric is really pretty.

sadly, they seem to run on the large size. i wear size 14 pants, but the xl was too baggy in the legs and a little too large in the waist. i am sending them back and getting the smaller size.",5
"I bought this in green and i absolutely love it! the quality of material is very fantastic, a durable fabric that will hold up well over time. its a good quality too, so can be dressed up somewhat, and also does well as a very casual piece. love it!",5
Another success! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer. very lightweight yet not sheer. design is even more appealing in person. a must have for your closet.,5
Love this blouse! the color is really unique and love the back button detail. i dont think the white buttons look cheap at all as another person pointed out - they add a lot to an already beautiful top. can't wait to wear it!,5
Love!!!! i got the green and it goes with so much!,5
Love these pants. bought both the navy and the white. they are comfortable and a perfect fit. the xs is just right. i'm normally a 26 in denim and i was fearful these would either be to small in an xs or too big in a small but the smaller size is just right. soft and silky. they fall in a lovely way.,5
"This is a gorgeous high quality blouse. the color is stunning in person; i don't have anything like this color in my wardrobe. i'm an xl in retailer tops, and purchased this blouse in a 16. i am busty but the top still fit well. i have large upper arms but the sleeves fit fine; i wish they were a bit looser but that is my personal preference and probably doesn't apply to most people. if you're very thin and not busty you might be able to size down, but i'm honestly just not sure. i'm happy to say",5
"Hi, i bought these in both colors. the material is very nice. for me the only part of the pants that stretched was the waistband. sadly i had to return them.",5
"Purchased these in both colors today. (great sale price.)
hei hei is my favorite brand of pants, especially their pull on prints.
i am always a medium, these ran slightly large in the waist and stomach. i tried on a few mediums and luckily found the smallest in each.
the beige motif is beautiful and can really be dressed up. the material is soft the color scheme is gorgeous. they have a lovely silky feel to them. i always wear an over top so the little bit largeness won't bother me. being on",5
"This is my second pair of joggers from retailer and since this purchase, i have bought another pair. it seems that they are just a great fit for my body, long and lean, but not extreme. someone said they run large, but my experience is true to size. these pants can be very casual around the house, out for errands or dressed up and worn for casual evenings out. i love that the elastic waist isn't bunchee. they hang very straight and pretty, just like in this picture. the fabric has some text",5
"Got these in 28 and they fit like a dream.  the best medium wash, so versatile for all seasons.   i love the rise because it sucks in my pooch.  sometimes i wear 29 or 28 in paige.  i have a wide waist, slim hips, flat bum--these jeans help me look shapelier.",5
Love love love these pants!!! super comfortable and fit true to size.,5
"I always love the arielle jeans. every color seems to be slightly different in the fit, but they are always slim enough in the leg and thigh to be stylish without being too restricting. to echo the other reviews, the pockets are a little low on these compared to other arielle cut jeans that i already own. i have a fairly straight, athletic shaped body and went with my 'larger' size to wear them as more of a boyfriend fit. the fabric is a very soft and forgiving denim and the dark color can be dr",5
"I'm a 32dd, so i wouldn't normally wear a bralette out of the house (not enough support). this bralette is actually very supportive and comfortable. i'm probably going to get at least one more. for reference, i'm a 32dd (small back, big boobs) and a small fit me extremely well.",5
"When this piece arrived, i was surprised at how weightless it was. there are 2 layers to it, an underlayer and then a very fine silk toplayer together, the ensemble is incredibly light and it is almost as though i feel like i am not wearing anything at all. to take it home, i did have to kind of stuff it in my bag, and this caused some considerable wrinkles which are very difficult to get out (super stubborn( but i am pleased with the look of the garment. usually, i like the look of a dress that",5
"This sweater dress is beautifully unique in that it has lovely sheer sleeves to dress it up, but it's made of a soft sweater material that feels comfortable, warm and wintry at the same time. it does run true to size, i ordered a small (5'5"" and 118 lbs). knitted and knotted has come up with some killer sweater dresses this season!!!",5
"This robe is warm, soft and i like how long it is! it's perfect length. my favorite thing to wear around the house!",5
"This is such a soft, comfortable and well fitting blazer. i love the structured cut of a material that is usually used in more casual designs. i look forward to wearing it very often in the fall. so glad i purchased this one!",5
"I absolutely love this jacket! i bought it and wore it to work to next day, and received tons of compliments! it is easy to move in as i have ark that required stretching and bending alot. i am 5 5 119 pounds and xs fit a well.",5
"Cute, cool dress for hot summer days. very roomy. has pockets!",5
"A wardrobe addition to dress up, or dress down.
the sheer sleeves are a nice detail...

(i'm 5'6"", and the length hits me at the knee.)",5
"I have not had any sort of shedding problem with this jacket. i have worn it open with black jeans and a long necklace, and buttoned with a scarf and jeans. it is really cute! i am 5'4"" and 115 lbs, and i got the small. i wouldn't hesitate, especially since it is now on sale.",5
"This dress is absolutely beautiful! the grey is more vibrant in real life than the picture suggests and the maroon red is perfect for fall and winter. seriously, this is not your typical sweater dress; the sheer sleeves elevate it to a whole other level. it comes to just above the knee on my 5'7"" frame. it is a bit looser on top (i'm 32c) and more form-fitting around the hips but not tight or clingy. and so comfortable! i am 122 lbs and took my usual small so i think it runs true to size. the sl",5
"Love the lines of this tweed look jacket. pockets are a definite plus, as is the soft pleat in the back. this is a good piece to transition from winter to spring. it updates your jeans and soft t-shirt look.",5
"This dress is even better in person. the base color of the fabric is a very light peach, and very lovely. as you can see from the photos, the green floral pattern running up the front of the dress varies slightly from dress to dress, but i found the front on mine was very similar to the 1st photo. the bright green flowers are a light mint green, which plays beautifully with the light peach. there are more details in the print to discover in person, which is a nice bonus. the silk is not stiff li",5
"Nice quality, soft fabric, sleeves definitely make a unique statement. the fit worked for me, although it could have more room in hips (for my hourglass figure). got m, size l was way too big. i am 34d, but the dress can definitely accomodate bigger chest. the color are my favorites in this season.
wear it to stand out!",5
"I wore this dress to nyc on a date. it was perfect...light, flowy, and lovely. the peach and green combination is really pretty, and i love the hemline, which is longer in the back than in the front. i can only say one thing: as i was walking down the street with my boyfriend, a total stranger (and not a crazy person) came up to us and told us we looked beautiful. enough said.",5
"I waited patiently for this dress to arrive in my local retailer store and loved the design immediately (the green motif). as others noted, it is on the flowly side. for this reason, i went with a size s. i wore it on easter and can't wait to wear it again. i did not have any issues with wrinkling or putting on the dress. it is a simple over the head, no fuss kind of dress. you get to be supremely comfortable and look like a goddess. this is one of those retailer pieces that you will have for years",5
"I wanted to buy my usual mp but was sold out and so was normal m. i got the regular l and it fits like a shift dress and does not enhance my curves. it looks like a luxurious knitted sack but i mean that in a good way. it is very comfortable, does not cling, and reaches just below my knees. i do worry about the stretch factor as other reviewers have noted but since i just received it we will see. i do not like the sheer sleeves. i wish i could take them off. i do not like the button loop at the",5
"Great casual jacket! it's a nice spring weight, can be worn in different ways by turning the cuffs, folding the collar, wrapping or unwrapping, etc. i love the way they styled it in the model shots. i am going to have to disagree with the other reviewers about this being tts. i have to say the medium was so oversized, it looked like i was wearing a fabric box. i have a broad back and 36ddd bust and am comfortably wearing the size xs.",5
"I was expecting not to fit into this because i'm womanly, and generally wear a size 16 in things. but the picture was so gorgeous i had to try. i'm so happy i did. it slipped right on and is flowy yet not overly so. it still has shape. the colors are exactly as it is portrayed on the site. i love having this in my closet!",5
Super comfy and longer than last year's version minus the hood. love it!,5
"Only the xxs was left, so i was a little concerned that it might be too small. not the case at all thanks to the very functional adjustable straps & high quality of craftsmanship & design. for reference, i'm 32c, 5'2 110-115lbs - kind off petite w/an athletic build. the black is lovely classic. the color, along with the beautiful design give this a timeless classic french look. very comfortable, too. love so much i, ordering more!",5
"This dress is a work of art both online and in person. the color is more vibrant in person and both colors are beautiful. i like the mango color better because it looks better on my olive skin tone, plus i like the purple flowers against the orange background. thank goodness for the liner because this dress is very thin. it wrinkles easily but i think it comes with the territory due to the thin silk fabric. for short gals like me, a belt is a must for a structured look if worn with heels; otherw",5
"I ordered size small. i am 5' 6"", 32 b. the fabric is super soft and the fit is great. there's an adorable little quote on the pantie's lining, and the bra has a beautiful print on its inner lining. the feel of the lace and fabric is divine. love it! one more thing to note...there is very little lining in the bra; really nothing more than an extra layer of fabric. it is enough to protect modesty, but not much else.",5
"Got these shorts in both colors: the blue-gray and the red-pink. super lightweight in hot humd weather, and keeps a crisp shape (doesn't get wrinkly and saggy like other linen shorts do). really nice quality interior finish and both front and back pockets are a usable depth.

if you're between sizes go for the smaller as they do stretch a bit over the day. i got these in a size 2 and they get a little loose on my 33""-25""-37ish"" frame. i'm 5'2"" and the petite was sold out, so i don't know if t",5
Beautiful jacket and i got lots of compliments. true to size. it's not thick but it's very warm.,1
I really liked this tank. i purchased it in the green. i went with my regular size 2. yes it's boxy but it's a nice tank that will get lots of use this summer. i'm planning on using it on our vacation to the beach . it is thin and soft.,5
I absolutely love this top. it has a very classy look and can be used casual or dressy. i get lots of compliments.,5
Light and flows so nicely. a great length--not to short or long. great with shorts. material is lovely.,5
"I was looking for a really warm, but stylish coat that i could wear when the weather is frigid as it sometimes gets here in the dc area. i tried on a size small, which is my usual coat size. while the coat fit, it was not flattering. for reference i am 5'9"" 128 pounds and usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer tops. in this coat i looked like a linebacker with pads on. the front material is doubled, which makes you look like you have a large protruding stomach. the shoulders are bulky and",1
"I wanted to wait until i could give this dress a thorough wearing before i reviewed it.  it exceeded my expectations!  i wore it at an outdoor wedding (the red) and received so many compliments on it.  it is well-constructed and the cutouts are gorgeous.  no danger so far of them ripping or tearing.  the zipper in the back is a little bulky for the dress, but not a major deterrent.

i'm 5'6"" and about 145lbs, and the size 6 (my usual retailer size) was perfect.",5
Great top for the older woman who wants to be stylish but needs a little extra room. the subtle color goes with anything. i love it!!,5
"This dress is perfect! i just bought it yesterday in store for a wedding i'm going to next spring. i got it in red, which is normally not a great color for me, but it's a darker red so it works. i love anything with cutouts so i was drawn to it immediately. i normally wear a 10 in a dress to accommodate my (rather wide) shoulders, and the 10 fit well. i can see it working for a variety of occasions. one big plus is the quality--this isn't even remotely flimsy.",5
Beautiful summer top and so versatile! it's definitely worth it.,5
"I ordered this on a whim, not sure what to expect. i'm petite (5'1, 110) and ordered a small petite. i usually wear xs-s in anthto tops but wanted a little extra room for layering in the cooler months ahead do i opted for the small petite instead of xs. it fits beautifully and is very cozy too. the collar is gorgeous and very soft. i think this is a beautiful and unique piece for any fall wardrobe.",5
"Got this dress for a party.  it was a last minute purchase and i was nervous if it would fit.  it not only fit, it looks great and is very comfortable.  have to love an a-line skirt and a top with short sleeves.  it covers everything while looking sexy.  and i didn't have to spend a second worrying if something was showing that shouldn't be.  got compliments all night.  i got it in red and black but went with the red based on feedback from husband and bff.  buy it now.  its perfect for holiday p",5
"This is a beautiful top, but it runs large.
i am exchanging for one size smaller.
it is worth the effort of exchanging!
well made, beautiful lace.",5
"This is my new favorite dress. while elegant it isn't too fancy for a nice office environment. very comfortable and a perfect size fit. i would like it if it was in petite only to make it hit above my knee, not below since i am 5' 3"" but not a big deal. everyone has complimented this dress!",5
This dress fits perfectly. the cut is so flattering. i am tall but the length is great. not too short.,5
"The shirt was better than it actually looked online. the only downfall was that there was a pulled thread on the shirt when i received it. it's something i can probably fix, just a little disappointed receiving in that shape.

i would recommend this top. very flattering and dressy if you want it to be.",5
"I love this tee, it is comfortable and soft with the nice detail of buttons at the shoulders, a good v-neck, and subtle stripes. however it runs quite long! i thought i ordered the petite but i received a regular length tee and it was down to my thighs. so order a petite unless you are quite tall or like a tee to fall that low over your hip area.",5
What a lovely top! the embroidery makes this simple top very special. it's too light-weight for january but will be a staple of my wardrobe come spring.,5
"I love this dress. i'd get it in both colors if i could! the cut and fit is beautiful, i'd suggest sizing down if you feel like it's too boxy or lacks shape. the bottom skirt is round enough to where you can twirl ( #1 thing to look for in a dress ;) ) and it's just overall a classic pretty dress. my only complaint is that the overlay cut out seems a little bit delicate and i'm afraid it will be ruined after a few wears but it seems to be holding up fine so far and isn't incredibly delicate like",5
"I originally ordered the peach stripe tee in my normal size, medium. after going to the store and trying another color on in a small i realized i should have sized down. i have since purchased the blue stripe in the smaller size. i love the fit and the colorful stripes of both. great light-weight, casual tee. i love the button details on the shoulder.",5
"I cannot give this dress enough praise!! i say it runs a little large because i'm normally an 8 but the 6 was just more flattering.  i wore it for a wedding and i was showered with compliment after compliment about the dress! i've never felt more beautiful, and wish i could have one in every color! and quality? absolutely amazing.",5
"More of a blouse than a tee because of the fabric which has a linen feel to it, on the front, the back of the top is more of a tee shirt material. not a travel top as it would wrinkle. the pattern and colors are the same as pictured. the sizing is large - i ordered an xs; my size is usually a small. it is a generous fit and boxy, not shaped at all. the back has a horizontal stitch band about half way down which provides a loose blouson effect.the back (which is all black and is tee shirt fabric)",5
"I got this top in the beige, size small. it is flattering and though i hadn't noticed the lace details in the back before i purchased it, they are a nice touch. this is a versatile piece. i can dress it up or down. this will definitely be a favorite of mine this season.",5
Very pretty & shimmery. suitable for slightly dressier occasions. comfortable fit.,5
I bought this dress with a specific occasion in mind. i could not turn it down because it fit like a glove. i love the cut and the length.,5
"Obsessed with this sweatshirt! it's a must have for any loungewear lover. i'm normally a xs but sized up to a s for a more loose, relaxed look. i was afraid it would swallow me, but i love the fit! the knot in the front is a nice detail that makes this comfy top really cute. the fabric is a great texture, great for transitioning from summer to fall and winter to spring. love everything about this sweatshirt and will easily pair with leggings or jeans. worth every penny!!!",5
"The blouse is beautiful. the quality and design are spot on. but it runs quite large. i normally wear a small or an extra small depending on the cut. i ordered this in a small based on the way it seemed to fit the model. it's huge. i'm going to have to reorder in a smaller size, but i'm not sure if the xs or xxs will fit better. i'll probably drive to my retailer store and try it on in person. for comparison, i am 116 pounds, 36-26-36.,",5
"Love these pants. love the fit. i can't wait to wear them, but i have to find the time to hem them first. i am kinda tall at 5'9"" and i wear a lot of heels, even tall heels. but these pants are even too long for my 3-4"" heels, and i don't wear taller than that to work every day. only on very rare occasions. so they do need to be hemmed. they are a great cream white color so can carry on through the winter and will also get a lot of use in the spring and summer. good fabric and a nice fit!",5
"Looking forward to wearing this blouse for the summer. easy to wear--no special bra needed. thin cotton material will be perfect for vacationing in japan. i wear a 4p but because the smocking in the shoulder area leaves the lower part of the shirt a bit blousy, i bought the 2p. i prefer the straight hems instead of the dresses and tunics with the longer back hem, which gives my petite frame the illusion of looking shorter. i liked this blouse so much that i bought it in the green and white strip",5

"Full disclosure, i'm six months pregnant. as such, this dress is perfect for me. it's soft and flown, and i look like i have a cute bump instead of like i'm wearing a sack. i ordered my usual medium based on other reviews, and t fits perfectly--so it would have been too big normally.",5
"I have a narrow face, and most coats with the big collars overwhelm me. this proportion is perfect. follows my shape without constricting but flows so well for a good line. color isn't quite laden green; it's more teal which works even better for me. so hard to find a wool coat these days that isn't bulky.",5
"This is a great coat, very lightweight, but warm. the color is gorgeous. it is fitted at the waist with fullness below and a great length. i am writing this review to give a heads up about the sizing. by usual retailer sizing this runs small and short waisted. i am generally an retailer x small and i need to exchange this one for a small or maybe even a medium (if i want to wear much underneath it). as it is it fits too well, like a dress, not a coat and looks short waisted. in fact, when i tr",5
"I wanted to love this. couldn't wait for it to arrive.  unfortunately, it doesn't look anything like the picture.  i usually wear a m/l in holding horses so i ordered a l but as soon as i held it up i noticed it was ridiculously large. the fabric is on the heavy side so the dress just hangs in a very unflattering way. and, it is extremely shimmery.  i love velvet, but the texture and sheen of this dress was just over the top. sadly, it is going back.",1
"I bought the ""light grey"" color. the dress in the photo does not look a thing like the dress in person, it does not look grey at all but more of a light teal/light blue.  it is absolutely gorgeous and has a slight swing shape. i took my normal size xs.  the end of the sleeves (where the buttons are) are very tight but still fit, you just have to be careful taking off or else undo the buttons.  also online inventory says no one has this in store, but i did end up finding it (rockefeller).",5
The bikini bottoms are high quality and feel very luxurious. order one size up. this line runs small. i read the reviews and ordered a medium. i am normally xs/s in underwear but the medium fits me perfectly. i wish i had ordered in other colors before they sold out! trust me you'll want another pair after trying these on.,5
"This dress is cute!! i ordered my regular xs which was too large but liked it enough to exchange for an xs petite and hopefully the fit will be better. (the xs was much too wide and came past my knee. i'm 5'2' and 123 for reference).  the grey is very pretty and is blueish gray... very misty and unique. the pockets are awesome and i like that it's lined in a fine poly that shouldn't cling to tights, etc in the winter. if you can find a size that fits you, buy it!",5
I always search each summer for a maxi dress and this is the winner this summed! i love the way it wraps. fits perfectly. i got a size medium and i am 5'5 34dd; the dress is long enough to wear with flats or heels. i recommend this!,5
"It was lighter weight than i expected but that's perfect for me considering florida winters are mild. it's more like a wool sweater than coat. the design is gorgeous, however, ran bigger than anticipated. i'm hoping an exchange to the xs will work otherwise i'm not sure i can get the fit i expect from this sweater coat. the buttons are plastic and would have made a much bigger impact if they were wooden but they're still nice. overall i love it and am hoping for the right fit so i can flaunt thi",5
"I found this dress delightful! i have worn it numerous times and though quite long (for some girls) fits me well. my only complaint is that if the wind blows it tends to fly open as there is only on clasp at the breast. the fabric is light and comfortable, i wore it in costa rica and it felt refreshing. i am 5'9"", 155 lbs and a 34a cup; i would suggest a larger size for girls as the small fit me very well.",5
"I loved this coat in the picture, and couldn't wait to get it. sadly, it did not deliver in real life. i got my usual size small, and it fit well in the shoulders and sleeves, and okay in front. the big problem was the back. it just hung from my shoulders with zero shape, and a lot of extra fabric. i considered trying the xs, but was concerned that the shoulders might not be comfortable, and honestly i can't believe the xs could possibly have been different enough to work. maybe i got a defectiv",1
"This is a really cute and flattering dress on me. i am 5'4"" 120 lbs and the 4 is a perfect fit. i am a little busty but the empire seam brings the dress back in slightly below my chest so it does not tent out.the asymmetrical hem makes it really flowy when you walk. the under dress is a lightweight fabric in a sheath cut that is shorter than the over dress which is a fun detail. the over dress material is somewhat gauzy and it moves as you move. the pockets are positioned in the front which is a",5
I'm not sure why this skirt is described online as having a blue motif. the background is black and the blue in the pattern could pass as grey. the material is a strong polyester which should be nice and easy to clean but it almost feels like silk. i love the aline and even with the ruffles it looks very slimming on this pear-shaped gal. i can see wearing it with strappy sandals and a light blouse in the next few weeks but pairing it with a sweater and boots well into the fall and winter. i thin,5
Very comfortable to wear. you can wear it any season.  it runs true to size.  nice fabric.  it&amp;#39;s a simple black dress.  love it!,5
This dress fits great. i love that it's fitted at the top but drapery and swingy at the bottom.  it has a thicker t-shirt type fabric.  i will definitely style this with a variety of necklaces or a scarf and cardigan for cooler weather.  it's much cuter in person.  for reference i'm 5'4 105 and got xs.,5

"It is such a pretty dress. the pics don't do this dress any justice. the cut and style is so flattering. the colors are gorgeous. you can wear it on a cool evening in summer and well into fall. i absolutely love this dress. even if the material appears a bit rough, there is a slip underneath.",5

"I tried this dress on in the store.  i wear either a s or xs in retailer clothes.  its loose fitting, so i went with the xs.  the arm holes were tight, but have very cute buttons if you look closely at the picture.  you can also roll the sleeves up and there is a coordinating plaid underneath, which adds a nice touch.  great length, not too short or too long.  the grey color is much prettier in person.  i felt it had a little more of a blue tint. for reference i am 5'6"", 124 lbs, and 32b.",5

"This dress arrived today, and it is both flattering and comfortable. i am just a smidge under 5'4"", and i ordered a regular xs. in the front, it hit me about 3"" above the knee. it is office appropriate for a business casual environment. the red was deeper in color than i expected (it seemed a little ""brighter"" on my monitor), but this is no problem for me; it is still a great color. i tried it with clogs, knee boots and ankle boots - all really cute. and, as and added bonus, it looks good with b",5
Love the dolman sleeves and its the perfect length. throw on a cute necklace and go.,5
"This skirt is gorgeous, sturdy, well constructed. i was afraid the midi length would look frumpy, but it was beautiful. it has a nice lining, flares into a pretty a line, and has a pull tab belt around the waist to cinch it a bit. i am normally a 2-4, and i bought the 4. it was a bit big, but the belt helped with that. i wore it for my bridal shower and got many compliments!",5
"What a perfect summer dress! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it's perfect. the slip is a little snug on the hips, but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger. i can't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer!",5
"This was my first time to purchase and wear a tunic and i was very hesitant about the look, but i love this design! it is beautiful and seems to be very well made. i agree with a previous reviewer that the slit is high (it comes to my waist, but i don't think it is a problem. i always appreciate this in other reviews, so hopefully it helps: i'm 5'2"", 117 lbs, and a small 32b. the xs works well for me.",5
Want to combine super comfort with super style and quality!! stop here and buy these!!!! you will not be disappointed!!!,5
These are by far the sexiest fitting overalls ever! they are lengthening and flattering and comfy at the same time!,5
"This top is really beautiful. my girlfriend saw it on a rack outside the dressing room, or i would not have seen it. i tried it on, and loved it instantly. it does run a bit big, and i ordered the extra small to make sure which one would work. the photos don't do it justice. reminds me of retailer of 10 years ago, when just about everything in the store was truly unique.",5
I am addicted to retailer and have purchased many many items from them. this is definitely one of the best blouses i ever purchased by far. i saw this while browsing through the store and love the print and colors and detailing. i espeically loved the velvet cutouts that gave this already beautiful sweater something extra. i did not purchase this top then because i felt full price was too much and on the hanger it looked like it could be short and boxy. when retailer had their black friday sa,5
"I am so pleased with this tunic. the fabric heavy enough to wear through winter, and it is very flattering. the colors are as pictured, as well. as another reviewer mentioned, the slit is high. but it still works perfectly with leggings or mid to high rise skinny jeans.",5
"I just purchased this velvet top in my regular size small (34-27-35) so i'd say it runs tts and i couldn't be happier! the designer, moulinette soeurs is one of my very favorites here at retailer and always seems to come through for me when i need something really special. it's is a vintage style top that reminds me of something miss fisher from ""miss fisher's murder mysteries,"" the ""downton abbey"" ladies or the designer sisters from ""the house of eliott"" would wear and that's a major compliment.",5
"The fabric is very nice on this wrap, but it wears like a blanket.",1
"Absolutely gorgeous! i bought my regular size m and while it's a little wide in the shoulders, it drapes beautifully. because i'm so short, i found the sleeves too long so i took it to my dressmaker and she shortened the sleeves about two inches so it's still elbow length and while i was there, she put in two small darts in the back so make it less boxy for my frame. can't wait to wear it - it's a beautiful material and i love the combo of the metallic sheen and velvet. so elegant. very gatsby,",5
These are absolutely fabulous!!! love them! comfortable great fabric! best buy of the year so far!,5
"When i saw this in store i was so attracted to the colors on the v neck and actually thought it was a dress! until i tried it on i was confused about the very high side slits.... then i figured it was a tunic. i've always hated/avoided tunics because i thought they would widen my thighs and give me a bad shape. they actually made me look straighter/slimmer which looked amazing! the more i had it on, the more i fell in love with it and didn't want to take it off! i can wear it in the winter and f",5
"I am a collector of clothes and textiles. that is a passion. this blouse meets all the criteria of something treasured from times past. the roses are almost charles rennie macintosh. i am so happy to own this blouse! it fits perfectly and makes me feel beautiful, stylish in my own style.",5
"This top is beautiful and special. the burnout velvet (so nice and soft), the flowers, the pretty metallic threads and even the back closures make it wonderful. i took my usual size 0. it is a bit more fitted on the bottom of the top (hip area) than i was expecting but not snug. i will wear this during the holidays and beyond! happy with my purchase and looking forward to wearing it!",5
"I have never written a review on retailer before, but after seeing this top in the store and then seeing how it is depicted online, i felt i had a duty to review it. it is gorgeous! i saw it in the store and tried it on with my mom and we both had a fit over it. the fabric is light pink with a shimmer. the flower detailing is so feminine and soft. the back's closure is just another piece of the beautiful detailing. i left the store and thought i would think about it only because i was trying to be",5
I wanted to love this tunic sweater. the material is so soft and a perfect weight. the color is pretty. bu the fit absolutely did not work for me. the tunic runs very small. a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small. the slits are quite high. i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back!,1
"This picture does not do this blouse justice. the material is velour where the flowers are and there's a bit of sparkle. i'm generally a pl in other stores and bought a m and was pleased. it's true to size. i'm 5'1"" and the regular length was perfect and not too long at all. i won't have to shorten it. the blouse will look great with skinny jeans and boots or the right long flowy skirt. it can easily be worn to a dressy occasion. it's gorgeous!!",5
"This dress had so much potential. the top was absolutely gorgeous. my issue was with the bottom half of the dress. the bottom is made from a heavy quilted material that is stiff and has no movement at all. the dress is supposed to fit like a modified mermaid dress where its more fitted around the hips and flares out, the dress i received had so much material on the bottom that it actually made my hips look bigger. i though about having the dress altered but decided to return instead.",1
"I absolutely adore this dress. i took my time buying it and when i was ready to purchase they were sold out of my normal size 6 but the 8 was still available, so i snagged it. i'm glad because the dress runs small and the size 6 would have been snug around the waist. the style is perfect and the dress is well made. the material is a heavier cotton and the white banding accents it perfectly. i don't think it's too white, like some reviewers have stated. you can't wear a bra with this dress, but t",5
"I absolutely love these pants! i was really hesitant to try these on for fear they would look like a diaper. i've always liked the look of these pants but didn't think i had the body type to pull them off being 5'5"" with some curves. i tried them in my local retailer in the solid grey in both a medium and small. i could have gone either way but the medium fit better in the he hips. the draping isn't as exaggerated or bulky as it looks in the pic either so it didn't add weight to my frame. the mate",5
"First off, the pictures online hardly do these justice. these pants are way cool. they are soft, have the perfect little pattern, they have a great tie detail on the cuff, they are higher waist (which is always more comfy), and they are super stylish! just like the other reviewer, i am occasionally hesitant on drop crotch pants...but i was so drawn to these. i'm glad i have them a shot because they are way better than i expected! these are worth the buy!",5
"This is a very chic tunic sweater. i absolutely love it. fabric is super soft and is a good weight. not too thick or heavy, which for me is a huge plus as i tend to run hot and usually can't wear sweaters. being hot natured, the turtleneck was a problem for me so i had my tailor alter it. it is still beautiful without the high neck. 
the fabric is quite stretchy and i found it to be tts. however, it is not as loose on me through the chest as it is on the model. i am just over 5'4"", and wear an",5
"I bought this in blue and can't wait to wear it, feels so soft. exactly like the picture.",5
"I got this for a special event and while i had to special order due to it not being in my local store yet, the minute i tried it on was very happy with the fit, feel and overall look. at the event i got so many compliments and love the way it fits - attractive, sturdy and very comfortable to wear, even with kicking up my heels on the dance floor. am so happy i got this and plan to wear it to other events coming up (weddings, parties, etc.)",5
"I was drawn to these pants because i loved the color and pattern, but i was sure they would be difficult to pull off. i tried them on and loved them! they will be perfect summer pants because they're so light and not clingy at all. the material is great. these will also be really fun to wear at the beach. i could stand for them to be about an inch longer, but the wide waistband is super flattering and versatile so i just wear them closer to the hip for the extra length. definitely worth trying o",5
"I ordered these leggings and loved them, for about an hour- at which point the belt loop ripped off of the pant, leaving a hole. i called customer service and they sent me a 2nd pair. same thing happened. i never even pulled on the belt loop. they are just so flimsy. it's a shame bc they are cool looking.",1
"Oh my, i just received my dress and it is gorgeous!. i was a little skeptical with the reviews but i am on the slender side so perhaps that is the body type it works for. i am 34b with a 25 waist. i got a size 0 and it fits well. i am 5'5"" and the length is good too, not too long. i could wear reasonable heel/wedges. it is a great class, sophisticated look. the material is great quality. i can't wait for an occasion to wear it to!",5
"I just received this dress and i love it. after reading the reviews i was worried that it would be too tight so i ordered both a 6 and an 8. i am 5'8"", hourglass, 135 lbs, and the 6 is just perfect. i love how it falls just below the knee, but the front slit gives it that little flirt factor. this is the go-to summer dress i had been looking for!",5
"I should have heeded the previous reviewer's advice. but i'm really short so i thought i'd give it a try. there is something really wrong with the bust. first, it's about 3-4 inches higher than it should be. the bottom trim cut across the middle of my bust. even if i hoisted everthing up in there to fit the cups, they are really only designed to fit cones, not curves. from the side it looked hideous. too bad, because the fabric and fit everywhere else is gorgeous.",1
"Yay, i found it: my go-to dress for this summer! it's perfect for casual day-to-day stuff, as well as summer festivals, nights out, travel, etc. i love the design, length and fit. it's a bit snug in the chest area but i went with the smaller size as the shoulder straps sagged a bit in the larger size. the lace-up front gives it a sexy corset-type bodice, but in a very casual, appropriate way. i think this dress will work well with many body types and ages, it's flattering for us curvier ladies,",5
"I love this dress. i got it in the blue and i feel like everything about it is so modern and class and summery. it runs a bit on the small side. i'm between a 6 and an 8 - i went with the six, but it's definitely tight. i have a larger chest, and it's pretty low and sexy, though you could knot the laces at the top for a more modest neckline. i've also put shirts under it and it's a super cute jumper. i'm 5'1 and the dress (regular, not petite) hits right below my knee.",5
"I?ve been looking at this dress online for some time now, but i?ve been put off by the photo of the woman wearing it on the boat. it just did not seem right. but then i saw it in the store and i was sold on it. it is a wonderfully soft, linen dress. it is a bit tight in the midriff, so i had to size up a bit. i usually wear a size 2, but went with size 4 this time. size 4 fit perfectly. it is comfortable, easy to wear, just the right amount of sexy. it will be a nice every day dress for summer i",5
"Love this dress. i have it in white. just washed it in cold water in the machine and it still looks like new. very cute and comfortable. i stitched up the slit a bit, i am older, but otherwise, perfect.",5
"I absolutely adore this dress! the beautiful details and shape make it so much more unique and special than your typical linen dress. it's effortless, yet still a showstopper. i am a size 4 with hourglass shape and my normal size 4 it fits me like it was made for me. it's not too tight in the ribcage, yet it is slimming and flattering. not matronly at all! the laces can be worn tied up for a more modest look, or worn untied for a breezy, casual, a bit more sexy look. i will be wearing this dress",5
"Yes! yes! yes! 
i buy a lot of dresses from retailer, and about once a year i hit the jackpot with a dress that hits all the marks! this dress is it!

i bought the white linen version on a whim. i never buy white dress because, 1. i don't want to look bigger than my pear shape already is, and 2. i like red wine and i that's risky in a white dress! 

i don't know how this designer did it, but this dress is amazing! it's slimming and flattering and summery and current. and i am two sizes bigger",5
"I saw this dress online and loved it. i ordered the blue denim one in my usual sizes an 8 and 10, but i think the 10 was sized wrong. anyhow, both were too small, so when i returned them, they were in the store! i ended up with a size 12 which fits great, with a little bit of room. it is light weight, simple but fun and very comfortable to wear. i have received many compliments on it on my first day wearing it. i also ordered it in white, thinking that i might prefer that color, but when it arri",5
"I love this dress! it is more of a thick cotton linen than actual denim. it fits true to size in the sense that i am usually a size 6, but i would say it is smaller on top than normal size 6 dresses. i am 5' 8"", small busted, and a ""pear"" shape, so i like the more fitted style of the top with the a-line skirt. i love the length hitting just below the knee. it is flattering for my body type. seems well made and at a good price point.",5
"This is a stunning blouse! you can't tell from the photo, but it looks very 1930-1940's. i am so happy with this blouse, it is gorgeous. i'm an xl, and purchased this blouse in xl and it fits wonderfully. it fits nice and flowy and i feel i don't need a cam underneath. i highly recommend it!",5
"Don't be put off by the sparkle! this jacket is amazing. lovely detail with the print on print with the sequined patches. i love this retailer in house brand, elevenses. i take a medium in this brand( 8/10) and the medium fits full with room like a bomber style would offer. i had tried a small in my local store and it was not a small -small so if you want a tighter fit then go for a small. but i like thinks to have a more fluid feel. i have a 34 dd chest as reference. i plan to wear this in spring",5
This jacket is so pretty and fits amazing! i ordered the size small and it fits as expected. i normally wear a size small and a size 4.,5
"A couple of months ago i bought the white in this top in my usual size small. it's cute & flowy & like to wear it with ankle or capri leggings. have worn with shorts as well. casual & cute! plus i love cotton anyways. 5'3"", 117#. think i'll go ahead with the other colors since the heat will be arriving soon....",5
"This top is beautiful. i would say the pink stands out more in the print in person than in the picture, and it's gorgeous. the adjustable strap is nice. there is just enough padding in this swimsuit to feel protected without being bulky or worrying about it moving around in the top. this is seriously my new favorite, could not recommend enough!

for reference, i am a 34a, and purchased a small.",5
"I did not experience the issues the other reviewers mentioned. wore this to a wedding last month and received many compliments. beautiful, comfortable dress. the bust fit well -- slightly large on me (i am *just* a b) in the size i needed, but not horribly so. love this dress!",5
"This dress is very feminine and flattering on, especially for hourglass figure gals. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand but i sized up to 6 regular (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). when it's very fitted on top, i like my dress to be a bit longer. the bottom hem falls about 2 inches longer on me than shown on the model (i'm 5'2""). it feels tight when first zipped because the dress is cut to fit the curves of a woman, but it loosens up after a few minutes of wear. the design of this dress is",5
"This dress makes me looks curvy,thin and sexy! i tried on almost every dress in the store in every style. this one was a winner. i bought 2 others but this one was my favorite. i'm 5'5"" 130 (32dd) sz4 fit perfect. the picture on-line does not do it justice - you must give it a chance and try it on for yourself. it looks like an average dress on the model - if you have curves you'll love this dress!",5
"I actually love the fit of this t. the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit - but i love that it has more of a flared shape. the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate, it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t, and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape.",5
"This shirt is the perfect go-to; classic white button down, with a twist! the fit is flattering & i would have to say runs a little large. i am 5'4,124 lbs, broad shoulders, with a 36d bust and bought the 2 (outside of retailer, a 36d usually needs about an 8). i was worried what may happen when i wash it because it fits perfectly but i washed it in cold & hung it up to dry & it was fine.",5
"This top is a must have for summer. it is light and accentuates the figure. i'm 5'3 and many tops overwhelm me, but this is shorter in the front and a touch longer in the back. the cotton is very nice and it has a somewhat wider hem. if you have hips this somehow makes them look narrower.
if they had additional colors, i would have bought them all. i'm a 36c and the size 8 was perfect.",5
"Just buy these! i bought the olive green color and loved them, so i bought the navy blue. they fit true to size, i'm a size 4 and bought the 27. they are comfortable and make your bum look good. i prefer skirts, dresses and shorter pants like these gauchos instead of shorty shorts during the summer, and these will be something i wear all the time in warm weather. you can wear them casually or dress them up.",5
"Nice quality, not too thin like most white tops and the arms are cut just right. perfect length too.",5
This dress is amazing. it is comfortable with great fabric and very high quality. if you have a lot of curves it may not be the best dress as it has no give and flows straight down from the shoulder.,5
"This dress is gorgeous!! amazing colors, drape and bra friendly if ur not too big chested. i can wear this w a strapless bra and the tie in back does work.",5
"Awesome pants. they look a lot better in person than in these pictures. i got it in dark blue. they are very comfortable, and can be used day to night. if you like cropped pants and wide legs this one is a good option. it's a bit more dressy than other models, still look casual and fun. i may end up getting a couple more for myself...",5
"Impecable workmanship (overseas). i usually wear a petite 2 but ordered this in a regular size 0 and glad that i did. since it curves up on this side, it barely overs the waistband on my jeans. ordered this in pink but it's more of pale coral pink. the style is more of a semi-halter sleeve but it have snaps on the inside shoulders to keep the bra straps from showing or you can wear a halter bra. it's a very light weight cotton and flowing and it will be great for the hot weather.",5
"When this dress first showed up online, i liked it, but didn't buy it because i wasn't in love. retailer weekend popped up, so i decided to take advantage of the 15% off and ordered this dress. it shipped to me in no time! the dress is beautiful. the fabric is soft and airy. this is the first ""off the shoulder"" dress that actually stays off the shoulder. no riding up, no fussing! i suggest sizing down because this dress is slightly flowy.",5
"This is such a cute top! i've learned to size down in swing tops or else they look way too big - in a sloppy way. i ordered the xxs (5'3"" and 110lbs) and it fits well. it'll look cute with my black skinny dress pants or jeans. i definitely recommend!!",5
"I'm curvy, and i often have trouble finding pants that don't have weird creasing and fit both my waist and thighs. these fit awesome, especially when i use the buttons at the waist to make it a little smaller. they do emphasize my hips, so if you're trying to hide hips, these aren't for you. i love them, though--they drape beautifully and feel great.",5
"Fits well (true to size), very stylish and comfortable. i'm going to have to buy these in more colors!",5
"This tank is so classic and summery and i never want to take it off. it's very soft, and the fabric is decently thick. it hangs away from the body and has a nice swing to it. it works well for my very straight figure and small chest, but finding the right fit might be problematic for someone more blessed in the chest area than me.",5
Delighted with these. made in the usa was a big selling factor. great quality and fit. will look out for more active wear from this brand.,5
Another cloth and stone success! love the back! denim goes with most anything!,5
Love the bright colors! made really well!! super soft and vibrant!,5
"This top fits exactly like the last photo, which was my hope. it is not as slim as the other images. it's a swing top and the arm holes are perfect size, and the mock turtleneck is not too high. the fabric is thick, so will be perfect transitioning from summer to fall.",5
"I'm so glad i tried these on at one of my local retailer stores. i didn't really think much of it online but they have a much nicer look and cut in person. i got the navy blue in size 27 which fit tts. i got a regular size vs. the petite size which i usually like to go with because i'm short but i actually found that they fell very similar to the model's length shown online. they seem so versatile, i'm looking forward to wearing these!",5
"Love these pants. they are so easy to wear and look really polished and put together. i bought all 3 colors but i had to go a size up so that they draped correctly on me. i am usually a 4 but bought a 6.

i also love that they hit above the belly button so they work with longer crop tops.

i do wish they came in more colors.",5
Love this sweater! it feels so soft and it slides right on over the head and neck. easy to wear. this is my favorite sweater. i wear it all the time. the lilac is a really nice subtle color as well. meant to be roomy.,5
"I normally avoid white tops because they usually don't have that pop,but when i saw the 50's styling on it i just had to try it. i came in to buy another top from their catalog but it was such a wow i walked out with it instead.",5
"I found these at my local retailer on the sale rack, in a moss green color. the material, cut, and overall quality of these gauchos is excellent. they will be a nice transition into autumn with a light top and a jacket. i got them in size 26, and they fit perfectly. highly recommended - with the 40% off of sale items, they cost $42 + tax.",5
"Was worried these pants would make my 5'2"" frame appear even shorter, but no, they looked great and fit perfectly. very comfortable. love your pilcro brand, but will remember this brand for the future.",5
"I love these shorts! i know reviews say to size down and yes you very well could. but i like my shorts a little bigger so they hang on the waist and can wear a belt. they are so comfortable and the length is perfect! i love that they are loose around the thigh so they don't ride up while walking. i think they might look silly rolled down because they are so wide. i wish they had black, army green, and a dark wine. i would be in heaven!! i got the dark grey and the navy and am very happy.",5
"I purchased these in taupe, mint, and coral. they are extremely comfortable and soft. they can be rolled up to 3 different lengths. i stayed in my regular size and the fit is great. i can see why they sell out so quickly. a must for summer season.",5
"I live in these shorts all summer long. they are so comfortable, soft and practical. i have purchased a couple of these every summer but this year they were so many pretty colors i ended up with 6 new pair.. they go with just about everything and are soft and perfect for texas heat. i stayed true to size on them.",5
"The photo does not do this top justice. if you pull the tie a bit, it shapes the blouse a bit. i have a few work tops from retailer that i treasure -- they look good, wear well, wash easily and drip-dry perfectly. this top fits the bill too. and it goes with navy, black or even wine-colored pants. grab one!",5
"I bought one pair last year and two more this year! i love them! they fit tts and the ""red"" ones look exactly like the picture.....more of a pink color. super cute color! buy these shorts!!!",5
I absolutely love these shorts!!! everything about them is perfect!! i have them in almost every color. they wash beautifully. i don't dry my shorts in the dryer. they fit the same as last years'. i'm thin & pretty straight with little hips. i wear them in a size 28. i tried the 27 & they felt a little snug. i don't like my shorts tight & i like when they can hang down a little with a belt or not (like the model in the picture). i don't find that they stretch out much after wearing but that coul,5
"These shorts are perfect. not too short, but can be cuffed so not too long either. the fabric is soft and gets even softer after washing. bought two colors in the late spring and then recently added to my ""hyphen"" shorts collection. you can dress them up or pair with a casual t and flip flops. note - if you like your shorts loose, order true to size. they do stretch at the waist, so if you want them to fit true to size, order one-two sizes down.",5
"This dress set my heart a-flutter, but i had quite a time figuring out the sizing. i literally ordered six different sizes, and when i put them on, they all seemed to look like a very beautifully embroidered and elegant tent. if only i could just nip it in a tiny bit at the waist! then it would look like the model does! (i actually think they probably pinned the back of the dress to get it to fit on the model).

so i played around with it and ended up putting in 2 small darts in the front. and v",5
"Perfect top! i love the mix of materials, silky in the front and comfy knit in the back. the tie on the side is adorable and adds a little something special to the shirt. happy!",5
"I love these shorts. would buy them in every color! the colors are all fabulous and the fit is great too. not too short, not too tight. very soft comfy feel.",5
These shorts are age-appropriate for all. they're loose fitting and cal me rolled up or left down where they end above the knee. the fabric is soft and colors are fun,5
"Bought these shorts in the store, in navy and loved them so much that i ordered them in the taupe. for some reason, the taupe pair is shorter but they still fit beautifully. the fabric is ligher weight than denim so i wear them a lot. love pilcro!!!",5
"I love the way these shorts fit and look; very comfy, but after laundering one time, the lavender color became blotchy. used regular detergent in gentle cycle and it looks like someone poured bleach on them in random areas & they are unwearable! i have several colors, but the only color that was a problem is the lavender. $58 for one wear was a waste. i hate to leave negative feedback, but be careful with laundering.",1
"This coat is super cute and flattering. i am 5&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;8&amp;amp;amp;amp;quot; and it comes almost to my knee on the back. i&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;m usually a small but got the medium in case i wear a bulky sweater underneath. comfy and warm, but won&amp;amp;amp;#39;t be warm enough when winter hits without a big sweater underneath. great to throw on to walk the dog or hit the bus stop in style.",5
These shorts are great! perfect length and this can be addicted based on how much you roll them up. i love all the colors. i've bought several pairs because of how comfortable and versatile they are!,5
"Love these shorts. they do run large, i wear a 29 in pilcro and the 28 in these shorts fit comfortably with a bit of room to spare. the turquoise is definitely green, and not as bright as what i see in the online photo, but still a nice color. they have a funny smell but i'm sure that will wash out.",5
"These are some of the softest most comfortable shorts i own and wish i had them in more colors. i like that i an adjust the length of the cuff since it's not ""hemmed"" to a certain length. i ordered the pink/salmon color and they go with so much!",5
"I was extremely excited to receive these pants, given the two positive reviews. i'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions. i sized down from my normal size (27 to a 26) and was swimming in these pants. i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work. i'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what, but be cautious ordering these pants.",1
"This pants the worst short that i ever had!!
i bought ;this short last week and i laundry it yesterday and it came out lost color!!
i was really shock definetly will return it to store.
fyi, i never use chrolox or bleach when i laundry.",1
"Great shorts. i've been buying these for the past few years. each year, i add to my collection with new colors. i have 8 pairs now! perfect length and can be rolled if needed to show some more leg.",5
"So glad i gave these a try last summer in the peachy pink color. this year, i got the darker grey. color is great- goes with so much-and they are so soft and comfortable. also love that these can work rolled up or down at the bottom",5
I bought these in a few different colors because they are so comfortable and perfect for summer. they fit true to size if you want a more relaxed fit. i sized down for one pair for a more fitted look.,5
"I absolutely love these shorts! i wear a 28 in all pilcro and these are no exception. i would not have grabbed these to try on, but the person who put my clothes in a fitting room added them for me. first, they are definitely short when rolled twice, and i do not have skinny legs. in fact, i never wear anything that exposes my thighs because i really dislike them. for some reason, these shorts make my legs look great! i thought for sure it was the mirrors at retailer, but i still like them at home",5
"I am 5'1'' and most normal size retailer tops are too big on the armpits and neckline for me.
i don't usually go for peplum, but i was drawn to this top bc it was very soft. when i tried it on, everything fit just perfect and length was also right for me. i like slight stretch of this fabric which hugs body nicely. i would say you should get a size that fits nicely on chest area.",5
I really like the hyphen pilcro chino pants so i figured i would try the shorts and voila' - i love the shorts too! colors are great and you don't have to cuff them if they seem too short - they're versatile and who doesn't love options?????,5
"This dress is lovely and the fabric is sensational.

the slits on the two sides of center front are really cool too.

i am 5'7 and it was way too long and i would not have it hemmed at it would remove the gorgeous
lotus pattern near the base of the skirt. i only wear flats at 70 but hope this fabric appears somewhere else
sometime. it is truly a gorgeous dress for a taller person.",5
I have had a hard time finding shorts as i have a smaller waist and bigger thighs. i am 5 ft 4 and weigh 125 lbs and i wear a size 25/26 in jeans i bought a size 26 in these and they fit great. i wouldn't size down if you have thighs as i like some room in mine.,5
"First let me say that i've recently fallen in love with the pilcro brand. i love the pilcro hyphen chinos and needed some new shorts for the summer. i have extremely muscular legs and have a hard time finding shorts that look good. i was hesitant to try these on because they said the inseam is 4"" but one other reviewer pointed out that they are a good mid-length if you unroll them, so i just went to try them on at the store, and what do you know? they are exactly that! unrolled, they come about",5
"The quality of this top is quite high. it feels like silk. the print is lovely, showy without being too over the top. i love it and would highly recommend it.",5
This top is totally adorable. it's one of my favorite retailer tops this season. i wear it with jeans or even red skinny pants and i get tons of compliments on it. it fits true to size and the material is washable and durable.,5
"I purchased two pair (navy and sky) for a trip to the caribbean and i'm so glad i tried them on in the store! these are the nicest fitting and most comfortable shorts i own by far. would highly recommend, well made too.",5
These are great wear- anywhere shorts. they are not too long and not too short. they are very soft and comfy. i ordered a size 6 and after wearing them a couple of hours i found that i should have gone with a size smaller perhaps. i will still keep the 6's for wearing around the house .,5
"I really love this coat! it is beautiful and very comfortable. while the attached scarf does cover the cute buttons, i'm glad it is there! it comes in handy when the temperature drops quicker than anticipated. the only thing missing on this coat is a lining as soft as the exterior.",5
I absolutely love these shorts and have them in 3 colors. they are a great price point and comfortable fit. be careful with washing as the darker colors seem to bleed.,5
"Wonderful flattering fit, mostly cotton so very cool and huge color selection. i bought 3 pair. thrilled with pilcro. 
only thing that could make these better would be if made in the usa.  cuffs roll down if you want less sun.",5
No. this is one of the most unflattering things i've ever put on my body. i'm a very well-proportioned hourglass - i tend to wear a small despite a booty and 36d chest - this made me look huge. don't do it.,1
"I absolutely adore these shorts and pick a few colors every year. like last year, these do run big so do size down. the length is perfect to roll them as much as you like. they look great after washing and wish they came in more brighter colors. love these and highly recommend these!",5
This shirt is amazing. the pictures on the model do not do the shirt justice! the shirt is a bit longer in person than shown on the model. the colors are also more vibrant. the material is so soft and has great flow. i am excited to dress it up for work with a pencil skirt and have the option to wear with skinnies and a cute sandal on my off days.,5
If i could get these in every color i would! these shorts fit so well and the quality is really nice. i wear them with t-shirts or dress them up with a blouse. i'm a mom in my mid-40's and its hard to find a decent pair of shorts that fit me without being too long or too short - these fit the bill.,5
"I was running low on good summer shorts and thought i'd try these based on having a pair of the pilcro cropped pants i got a couple months ago. i tried these shorts on in-store to make sure they fit right and that i liked how they looked but then bought them online (more colors were available in my size than what they had in store). i bought these in 3 different colors and i absolutely love them all! they are my go-to shorts now, they look good with the legs rolled up or down, and i will be wear",5
"A romantic find. light and airy. the color is slightly darker than shown. the soft, subtle ruffles give it just the right touch.",5
"Another excellent maxi dress by ranna gill. usually this brand of dresses tends to run small in the bodice requiring me to go up a size but i found that this dress ran true to size. i got a petite as well cause the standard size was a touch too long for me. very happy with the color, quality and uniqueness of the dress!",5
"I'm 5 ' 5"" and 132 lbs., 34d and the size m is perfect. i will probably wear a thin, long cami under it as it is slightly see through. it doesn't gape under the arms like some sleeveless items...it fits smoothly. as the other review mentioned, it would be a perfect swim suit cover up. but i'm going to wear it more as a casual, very versatile, perfect for a hot day summer dress!",5
"This is my second pair of these jeans (i ruined the first pair and immediately ordered a replacement). wear them all the time. i did go up one size to get a better fit (i don't exactly have slim thighs--ha!), but other than that, they are pretty perfect!",5
This top is amazing. so soft and the off the shoulder part stays where it belongs. i'm usually a large but got this in a med. fits perfectly.,5
"Been searching for a denim ""trucker"" jacket since last fall and was happy to see that retailer had this in stock, purchased it online without thinking twice. typically, due to my small upper frame, i'm 5'4, 130lbs, 34 a for referance, i'm between a size small and an xs. bought both and opted for the size small when it arrived. 
i love the fit, slightly cropped in the back and i also like how it""s lined inside. great quality and perfect for fall!",5
"I've received so many compliments. it's comfy and cute looking. the sleeves are a little short--which i wasn't expecting, but i love it nonetheless. just putting that out there in case you couldn't tell from the picture. i ordered an xs",5
"This is the perfect dress to transition into fall, either dressing it up with wedges or down with a leather jacket. i have never purchased this brand, ranna gill, but needed to size up which is rare for me when i shop at retailer. it is comfortable and lightweight. i marked it down one star on quality because for the price, i have already noticed some of the black lace stitching coming undone.",5
Loving this top! the material is lovely and high quality plus the design is very flattering on body. perfect for cooler evenings out. did i mention super flattering?,5
"I purchased this jacket and the levis sherpa denim jacket for comparison. i chose this one over the levi's jacket as this one had more shape/curve to the bodice, which i wanted. i am usually a small but needed a medium in this jacket-- i have wider shoulders, 34c chest, 28"" waist, 38"" hip, 5' 4"" 120lbs.",5
Love the way this feels ? epic and flowy and flattering ? and features my shoulders and de-emphasizes shape and size from waist down. waited for it to go on sale and it paid off. i'm wearing it to a wedding this weekend. i can't wait to show it off! highly recommended.,5
Just like the afterward lace cardigan i love this so much. i've had the black and white for about 2 years now and they are still intact! only the buttons fall off once in a while but that's when i'm being aggressive and on the go buttoning. the cardigans from this year just add to my knitted and knotted collection!,5
"I haven't owned a denim jacket since college, but i felt inspired this season. this pilcro jacket is perfect. a little distressed along the edges, tailored fit, and i love the cozy collar. looks expensive. fits really well.",5
This dress fits perfectly and is travels wonderfully through the seasons! the color and cut is really flattering and flows nicely!,5
"I bought this in late august and have been wearing it ever since. i love that you can wear it either on or off-the-shoulder. the second option adds sexiness even though the top is flowy, comfortable, and easy to wear. on the shoulder i've even worn it to work on casual friday. the print is versatile, and i like that the fabric has a little heft while still being soft and drapey. i definitely recommend, especially since i notice it is now on sale!! it is generously sized, so i'd recommend erring",5
Love this cardigan. the quality is beautiful and and comfortable. i think the cable stitching and pockets add such a unique touch.,5
"The dress is beautiful on the model. in person it's sheer, but i could have dealt with that if the fit had been great. i am 5'4"" and the petite was too short and the regular too long. both are very boxy and seem to run big. even the size small in both petite and regular were too big on me and usually in cloth and stone size small is perfect. i really wanted to love this dress but ended up returning several sizes in my attempt to find the perfect size.",1
"I absolutely love the color, cut and style of this maxi. the high neck and drop waist are both so flattering! the color and design is gorgeous as you'd expect from rana gill. i got my normal size 8 and it was perfect. i would have expected the fabric to be a little heavier but it works as a late summer early fall dress",5
"I got this jacket after being inspired by the looks from stranger things, and love that the fuzzy collar style is coming back! i tend to wear medium shirts and large jackets/coats to fit my long arms, and the sleeves are a great length for me. the lining has a gorgeous pattern on the inside too. the buttons were difficult to button at first, but became easier over time as the fabric softened. i also bought a pilcro skirt and it's comfortable too, so overall i&#39;m very happy with this brand.",5
"I love these jeans ~ the are so soft, so comfortable, nice fabric weight...not too heavy or stiff at all, very flattering, best of all they move with you, but do not completely stretch out by the end of the day ~ i am on retailer site now to purchase another color~",5
"I purchased this top on sale and was really excited about the style. it fit great the first time i wore it. i washed it once, according to the care instructions. after washing it in cold water and allowing it to air dry, it was basically ruined. it shrunk up in length widened out about two inches. i'm pretty bummed about it because it was cute.",1
"Saw this in the store and immediately liked it. when i tried it on, i loved it. colors are muted, and the style is very flattering. the fabric drapes nicely but is not too heavy, which is perfect for me to wear all through winter in the south. length is perfect for me (5'8""). it does look great off the shoulders, but i also think it can be worn up on the shoulders for a more work-appropriate look. it does run slightly large. i wear a large, but went with a medium in this one so it wouldn't be to",5
"I bought this dress to wear for our upcoming family pictures. i don&#39;t think the image does the dress justice - the fit is so flattering and slimming. i feel like it can easily be dressed down too, with a cute jacket in either denim or leather. the material is thinner, and it does wrinkle a bit. the price tag is a tad high also for a thin maxi dress, but i just had to have it. :)",5
"This vest is a stunner! the dark brown suede is so beautiful. the bronze grommets on the front are a perfect enhancement to the vest. it's hard to see in the picture but the stitching is also top notch. yes, it is a little pricey but it's an investment piece that you will wear and not only get a ton of compliments but feel special when wearing it too. it's a keeper!!!",5
I love sundry and their fun designs--i was disappointed because the fabric is very thin and the dark part of the heart is not black but bluish slate grey. it is just not what i expected from the picture. i bought the xs and it felt baggy on the body.,1
"Love this shirt. it's perfect. it's so perfect that i bought two. it is boxy but it has a lovely drape. please note, the heart is navy blue and not so black as shown. it's a thin shirt and i know it won't last a super long time, hence the back up.",5
"This is a wow dress as far as fit if you are a voluptuous or hourglass figure  woman. i have 
a 38inch bust and the medium fit perfectly...the whole dress fit perfectly. i'm so glad i took a risk and ordered it. i wish it was made from a better material
 like cotton versus polyester, but it has such a nice fit that i'll forgive the material choice.",5
"I was nervous about this dress due to the reviews saying it was odd and the colors being different. but these weren't issues for me. the color is navy. it has the loops at the sides of the dress to hold the belt on, but it also has a loop in the front center of the dress, which i think is nice, no one likes a limp bow ;) the belt is nothing to write home about, but it ties the dress together nicely.
the front pocket is different, but i really like it. i had a hard time conceptualizing it before",5
"What an adorable print!  yes, it may be a bit juvenile for someone my age but i don't care.  the toucans are rendered in soft primary colors.  the skirt is swingy but not poufy.  whole dress is lined so thankfully it's not a see through white fabric.  the bodice in medium petite fits me just perfectly (36dd) so if you are slender on top, size down.  agree with the previous reviewer about the zipper, which i find to be cheap and irritating, especially when zipping over the waistband.  worried abo",5
"This top is so soft, simple, and such a closet staple, if you get the right size! for reference, i am 5'3, 128 lbs, and i ordered the petite medium. it's perfect. the black is a great color, hard to describe, kind of soft with some warm blush tones. i also ordered the white and the peach. great at the sale price!!",5
"This top runs large. i had no problem sizing down one size, and could have gone down two sizes if not for the bust area. i ordered this tee in the distressed black color (in real life, it's more like distressed charcoal gray), and really like the fit. the asymmetric peplum is unusual, and cut at a flattering angle. i also really like that this top is not short; i often have trouble with length at retailer, being long in the torso. even going down a size, the length is great. overall, i like that t",5
This top runs larger so size down. i love it besides that. it's adorable!,5
"Love love love this dress! quality and fabric are terrific, design is a little 50s throwback! fits well and flatters the body!",5
"This blouse has too much drapey fabric and it's just not flattering.  in the front part of the blouse the fabric is relatively short, but the sleeves have so much excess fabric it almost looks like a clown suit.  sending back.",1
"I tried this (black motif) on yesterday in my local retailer store and fell in love...after sizing down! i do have to agree with previous reviewers that this top runs large. i am typically a s, but sized down to xs, and the fit was not even slightly snug. the material is soft and comfortable and i love the asymmetrical draped ""skirted"" bottom..very funky and arty-looking. i am 5'5"" and the regular length was great on me. as much as i will enjoy wearing it all summer, i also can't wait to layer it",5
Just got the small peach in the mail; love it. also got the black small petite; works great as this shirt is pretty long. great boho tee.,5
I found this today on the one and only rack. i absolutely fell in love with it. i bought my normal size medium and it fit perfectly. other customers were asking where they could find it in the store. i highly recommend. it can be dressed up or down.,5
I love the way this top fits and the way it flows. i have it in two colors.,5
"This blouse is pretty and drapes wonderfully. i don't think it's too wide at all. it's soft and comfortable. it's stretchy, yet with quality fabric that should keep its shape. definitely a classic piece. the sale price makes the cost more appropriate. the white is a little transparent, but with a tank, it's not a problem. the black is beautiful. i'm having a hard time choosing between them. i love the cut and sleeve details. it wouldn't have looked right with less fabric. it's needed for the sty",5
This is my new favorite shirt!! you can dress it up or down. so comfy and totally flattering :),5
"This is a super cute style and i love it with white skinnies. i purchased the gray colorway. i am normally a small in tops but purchased the xs based on other reviews. the xs is still pretty loose on me, but i don't mind too much because i like flowy tops anyway. the color is so pretty and the design is edgy. it will transition to fall well.",5
"I now have this tee in 3 colors - partly because my daughter loves and shares them with me. i typically get a size medium because i like things to fit a little loose, but needed a small in this shirt. goes great with all styles of jeans/knakis.",5
"This dress is crazy flattering and extremely versatile. i wish it came in other colors...i would scoop them all up. great price (plus used by birthday 15% off coupon). the fabric is light weight...but not flimsy. plus it's lined with a satin fabric so the dress won't stick to you. i'm 5"" 113 and i ordered the petite x-small and it is perfect. i can see it with fun sneakers (like the picture) or with some fun jewelry and high wedges for going out. thinking of buying a 2nd one as back up...it's th",5
"This is a beautiful piece that looks even better in person - a nice mix of modern and artistic, with just enough color and a flattering fit. my only concern is that it may get itchy throughout the day, especially at the neckline. if you can handle a little wool blend next to your skin, i would recommend it for style and fit.",5
"This is great, lightweight top layer that's just right for the little evening chill in the summer when the sun goes down, or on a breezy day. it's sheer, so it requires a bottom layer. the medium fits a little tighter across the shoulders and arms for me than it shows on the model, which i like.",5
"I ordered this in the peach color way. it is a nice, thicker cotton and while i have only worn & washed once (i air dried) it feels like a fabric that will hold up well. fit is good, i stuck with my usual medium. at first i thought it was a little big but i didn't want to risk the arms being too tight or short by going down to a small. in the body a small would have worked i am sure, so if you have slender arms going down a size may work well. i liked it so much though i ordered a second one in",5
"This top looks exactly as pictured, it is a little more billowy but i liked that about it. i found that it ran true to size and i am 5'8'', 128lbs and ordered a small. i am going to order the white because the cut is super cute.",5
I wish i had read the reviews prior to purchasing. this skirt looks amazing in photos and lace appears black. the lace on mine is actually purple - at first i thought it was just purple due to lighting with red underneath - but nope - pull the netting away and it is purple. lace netting hikes up on the right due to poor craftsmanship. i ordered a medium and felt it was a bit large. will return.,1
"This is a beautiful dress! great and flattering fit, comfortable, adorable print (the blue is stunning), and nice movement. one can't really see it in the photos, but the skirt is actually pleated. imo this adds interest and originality to the dress. i've been getting lots of compliments. get it while you can!",5
"Love this shirt, can dress up or more casual. wish i would of purchased all colors!",5
If you are looking for the perfect t-shirt to add a little flare to your basics this is the one for you. it is so comfy and baggy yet still looking like you pulled yourself together. i am just waiting for more colors to come out. i basically live in the green and white versions of this shirt.,5
"Looks great on the model, but in actuality there is way too much fabric; what should be flowy and billowy looks like a tent (or a maternity top on a petite woman). it didn't matter which size, they all fit me disastrously. i love the look and i thought of keeping it and having it taken in, but there's too much fabric under the chest to make it an easy cut/alteration on the side seams. sometimes i wonder who comes up with these patterns, and if they pin the shirts back on the models. if you put a",1
"One of the best retailer pieces i have ever purchased!  high quality and fits true to size.  i have a large chest, and this minimizes and creates a really nice silhouette.  i highly recommend, got so many compliments i bought both colors!",5
"Such a cute top. does run slightly big, depending on how loose you want it to be. for such a simple design, the quality is great.",5
A perfect little simple style summer dress just throw it on with some trendy sandals and off you go. runs true to size. just wished they would of made it in other colors and prints.,5
"Love this tee! it's stylish and comfy. i ordered the white and it's a thicker fabric, so i don't have to wear a camisole underneath.  i want to order more colors.  it does slightly big.",5
Love this crinkle cotton top for spring. the print is great and i can't wait to wear it!,5
I bought the top in an x-large because i normally wear a 12/14 and i was swimming in it. i unfortunately returned it but did eventually buy the large. it is a cute fit and a fun tee to have. the fabric is soft but a little excessive on the bottom.,5
"I purchased this in the green color, and in person it does have a little bit of blue in it so it's a very flattering color. the blouse has a simple shape but the details are what makes this an interesting piece. it looks as good under a suit as it does with jeans and a leather jacket. fits tts.",5
"I love this t-shirt, i feel classy, stylish and comfortable wearing it. as other reviewers have noted, it is bellowy in the peplum, but that is the design and i love it. it looks great with skinny jeans and can be dressed up or casual. another terrific purchase from retailer!",5
"Since there was only one review on this i thought i would chime in. i had been eyeing this for months and was able to get it on sale which was a plus since this had a pretty hefty price tag to start. that being said, the tailoring and detail work on it is just beautiful. i am a little worried about how the knit will wear but not worried enough to return it! as far as sizing goes, i ordered a 4 in the last byron lars dress and i am a 4 in this too. it fits snugly, but a 6 would have looked lumpy",5
Love this easy caftan short dress so soft easy and so stylish,5
"Great sweater vest. its not too thin or too thick, just right for fall or winter when its time to start layering. the material is a nice soft knit and the zipper on the back is a great addition. its easy to put on and i don't worry about the zipper snagging the material and causing any damage. i plan on pairing it with a polka dot long sleeve shirt that i have and it looks great. i am looking forward to wearing this when the weather becomes cooler. highly recommend. i am a 36b and usually wear a",5
"Had my doubts and ordered on sale just to try. am amazed how often i have worn this jacket!! goes with a lot of pants and skirts. great buy on sale. am 5' 6 1/2"" 150lbs and medium is perfect..",5
"The color is darker than shown (i ordered the denim looking one). the flower things are not very visible as it all looks one color. it must be great for the tall skinny model , but if your 5'4'' and pear shaped like me, it's a no go! took it back to my local store.",1
"When i saw that these were on sale, i was actually going to order another pair as i have really been enjoying them and wear them quite a bit. unfortunately, the large that i take is sold out otherwise i would own two pairs. although these are called lounge pants, i put them together with white or black accessories and have worn them everywhere. since my legs are not long, i did have to shorten and they are still a bit longer on me than the model. however, it was well worth it.",5
"I love vests and this is a great one, warm and cute!! because it is sweater material some of the threads look like than can pull, but i still think its stylish and different and still a classic to have!",5
"Love everything about this jacket its super soft, thin, and looks great! it's versatile and a great layering piece for someone that lives in a very warm climate! prefer the sleeves to be worn rolled up and the inside belt definitely helps give the piece more shape and dimension!",5
"I love this thing. i bought it yesterday and already am wearing it today, and i have been known to leave things sitting around in my closet for awhile before i wear them, especially if they aren't a sure thing. for reference, i am a curvy, busty size 14. i bought an xl but a l would have worked too. it has a drawstring on the inside back and on the bottom center back hem, so it can be adjusted for more shape through the waist. it has a beautiful drape, is very soft, and the embroidery makes it s",5
"I was able to try this one on at the store, and it was so loose on me, i assumed it was a large, but no, it was a small! (i usually wear size 6-8 in dress size, s/m in tops) admittedly, it does pull over the head, with no zippers or elastic to give shape. but it feels like water on the skin and has just the right amount of ""show it,"" plus coverage for wearing around the house, i'm keeping it.",5
"I bought this jacket based on how it looked on the model, and from the reviews. i found it to be super big, and unflattering to say the least. i'm 5""10, 155lbs. i sent it back.",1
"Love the fabric and the casual way this jacket drapes. the color is nice, i bought the blue. usually wear petite sizes but they were sold out so bought the misses in medium and it works perfect. like i can layer it for summer/fall since its very light weight fabric.",5
This vest is well made and a very flattering cropped silhouette. i typically wear a 0p and ordered an xxs--it fits perfectly. it looks awesome with the shirt pictured underneath.,5
This skirt is gorgeous!! drapes beautifully & the color is vibrant! get it!! you'll be so pleased! i sure am!!!,5
"I purchased an xl and am 5'8""tall. the pants fall near the ankle just like the pic. i plan to wash on my gentle washing machine cycle. the texture fabric print will pair well with any printed tops you choose. these lounge pants are great for everyday wear especially for errands in town. so much better a choice than yoga pants which to me look ridiculous when wore in public. so ladies, please leave your yoga pants for the gym and treat yourself to these casual, comfortable pants. i have two pairs",5
"If i could tell you how many compliments i got on with this coat, i would end up writing a book. this coat is beautiful, fits like a glove. i got the size 4, went into the store to try it on to make sure it fit right and tried on both the 4 and 6. i'm typically a 2, so i guess i went a size up. this coat is striking and the colors are beautiful.",5
"This is a super cute t-shirt!  it runs a little big and not as long as some t-shirts which is good.   it hits mid-hip on me and i'm 5'7"".    i got the gray at my retailer store and liked it so much i ordered the black one too.   warning:  the black one is actually a brownish-black which i didn't like so back it goes.",5
I was so stoked about this swim suit.  i bought it for mine and and my husband's anniversary trip.  it didn't disappoint.  it was gorgeous.  amazing quality. fabulous on.  unfortunately in my case though - the bottom is incredibly low cut and showed my c-section scar. so it had to go back :(,5
Love this coat. the colour is vibrant and it is well made. it does however run small. for me it was two sizes. i am usually a 00p and ended up purchasing the 2p. glad i tried it on in a store. it is a good spring/fall coat as it is lightweight. if i had purchased the 4p i could layer it a bit more. good but though. just be sure to size up.,5
"Got this in medium (5'6', 36c, 120 lbs.). many of retailer tops i'm a small but this was a good fit for the m. got the white. not really see through but need to cut the side tag out as it shows through. i'm not sure about the other reviews - this was totally not boxy on me - falls very nicely and drapes slightly. a really sweet but simple tee shirt to wear in the summer. you can wear this dressed up with heels, stacked sandals or just with flats - ballet or strappy sandals. looks great with rolled",5
"This dress fits awfully. it's not short, as pictured in photo. it hit just above my knees. it looked like sack. i would've, also, felt like i was choking  all night with it clasped around my neck. it, potentially, may look okay on someone who is very tall, skinny, and lanky, but i have my doubts about that too.",1
"I bought this skirt in the blue motif in my usual size large. it is very comfortable, light and it is lined! i wore it with a navy cotton lace meadow rue top from last year, gold gladiator sandals and a long gold retailer necklace.",5
"Just the perfect weight for summer wear. falls gently over tummy without being too long and the ruffled edge and quirky uneven length make it just interesting enough to make it feel like more than just a tee shirt. i got it in black and re-ordered in pale blue and am hoping the lighter color is not ""see-through."" this is a nice buy on sale and can be dressed up or casual. it feels and wears great but i have not washed it so gave it a good on quality. if it washes well then an excellent would be",5
"My daughter loved this tee the first time she tried it on. since then i have purchased the white, yellow/lemon and rose pink colors for her. the material is soft, it washes well and it looks great. she says these tees are some of the most comfortable she owns and it looks good with shorts, jeans and leggings.",5
"The ruffle is a sweet detail on what might be an otherwise basic, rather boxy shirt. it is a nice weight and drape, but please know it is a bit short and square. i love the asymmetrical ruffle, however, and think it makes this tee worth it.",5
"Love this dress! paid full price and completely worth it. fit tts for me- i'm 5'8"" 135 lbs., with a slim upper body so i had no issues with the neck being tight. definitely would be braless or need a strapless bra. gorgeous material, light and breezy dress. best retailer purchase in a long time!",5
Great color fit was very true to size,5
"I love this tee shirt. i love the higher neckline and the feminine and subtle ruffle at the bottom. it is my favorite tee by far! i am buying my second round of it now. i have one in coral, light blue and i am ordering more. the only down side is that both of my current shirts developed holes veyr quickly.; one on the shoulder and the other in the usual belly area that comes from the granite counter and jeans top button. there is no excuse for the shoulder holes in my mind...but i love the look",5
This top is easy with nice hem detail.,5
"I tried on a size 8 in the store just for fun... (i am a 0 petite) and then decided to take a chance and order my usual size. i was a little worried as many reviews said the dress was small, but it was on back order and decided to wait before ordering a size up. the 0p was actually fine, yes, it is a little hard to zip up, but once on, it is totally fine... not even too snug... but i didn't sit and eat... we shall see. i don't plan on ordering the size up. i think the zipper needed some wiggling",5
"Bring back the old retailer timeless pieces! this cardigan is very flattering, the flutter sleeves add a romantic touch to the cardigan. the colors are neutral, and the vine part (black) is like velvety. the fit is super flattering, i originally bought hte xs in the store, but decided to also order the xs petite to compare ( i am 4115 lbs, 5'1.5"" and 30 dd, with 26-27 waist). both fit, but the petite was better fitted on my waist. also, the length would work better on top of dresses. i also tried",5
"Love this top! got it in the blue and it looks great with jeans, shorts, crops...some say it's a little short and boxy. while the style is cut larger, i wouldn't call it boxy and i definitely didn't find it to run short. a great staple, wish it came in other colors besides white and black/gray.",5
"Very cute top. i went down a size because for me it was a little large in the back, but that was just my taste. i purchased the denim print.",1
Super cute!! will be buying another color of this tee.,5
Nice top that can be worn alone or underneath a sweater. can be dressed up or down and worn in all seasons.,5
I debated between the xs and the small..and ended up with the small because it's 100% cotton i probably couldn't probably gotten the xs one. we will see if it shrinks. i hope it does a little. i do wish the retailer sizing was a little more consistent because sometimes the xs is fine.,5
I bought this for my mom's birthday and she loves it. fits true to size and flattering for all busts. mom went up a size to be able to put a sweater underneath but she received lots of compliments at a recent function she wore this to. great lines.,5
"I love this top! i was thinking that i was going to need a x-large because i'm very ""busty"". i tried it on at the store, and the large was perfect! it's comfortable and flattering. not boxy at all. i bought it in plum and white. the plum is more a wine color than a purple, which i prefer. 

the buttons are beautiful, but i couldn't see myself buttoning and unbuttoning all of them, since they don't slide out of the buttonholes easily. but i had no trouble slipping it over my head with just a fe",5
"This shirt is awesome. i absolutely love the style of this shirt! it's super flowy, and is a really breathable fabric. i've been wearing this shirt a lot lately with printed pants. the only downside is the quality of material. it kind of feels like this shirt could have been made myself with a plain t shirt and some basic sewing skills. it also feels like it's going to start falling apart at the arm seams. nonetheless, i adore the shirt, and will be getting a lot of use out of it this season! no",5
"Love the design and colors
runs a but large through the middle",5
"I was looking for cute comfy stylish tees and was ecstatic when i came across this one. i purchased the coral and i love it! it's adorable on, i'm going to purchase another color. so happy!",5
"I think this top works best for a petite person. i am 5'1"" and 106 lbs. the xs is perfect for me. i love it so much, i purchased it in more colors. i machine washed and line dried. it washed beautifully.",5
"This is a great t-shirt; i love it. it fits great, isn't too bulky and has a great length to go with anything. i love it.",5
"A great basic t, so very much cuter than most. i have black and white both and wish it came in more colors.",5
"This cardigan is beautiful with its cropped fit, flutter sleeves and vineyard detailing. i can see wearing this a lot this fall and winter. my only complaint is that the sweater was pilling/shedding quite a bit the first time that i wore it. i hope that that doesn't happen every time that i wear it. i also have yet to wash it to see how the fabric looks after washing.",5
"I bought this in the sky color (and sized down from my normal medium) and absolutely love it. i don't think it's boxy at all. on the contrary, i love the way it hangs (i don't find it to be short either, though i do tend to layer with a longer cami underneath). p.s. the ruffle detail is precious!",5
"Love this shirt so much i bought it in 2 different colors. the reviews said it was so boxy and plain, but i disagree. looks great with jeans or a skirt without looking looking too casual. love that they are not too long also. so many tees are soon long and these are not thank goodness.
definitely runs big",5
"I absolutely love these tees! i have them in almost every color - i find i can wear them with almost anything (can dress them up or down)....
i feel like they are true to size. i purchased the small but i probably could have worn an xs too - i wanted a looser fit.
also, they wash and dry well too!
for reference: 32d, 27, 35",5
"This dress did not disappoint. it fits great. i'm 5'3"" and weigh 114 and i got a petite xs. length was perfect, i have a longer torso, so the waist was a bit higher than mine, but it didn't sit strangely and hung well. i am small chested, and the top fit me very well, i think if you have been blessed in that area, you may want to size up. 
overall, it really is beautiful, the pattern and the unexpected transition from one pattern to the next is just what i hoped for and why i buy from retailer. i",5
"I love this tee. as others have noted, the ""pink"" is really more of a coral orange, which is what i was hoping for. i wish they had another good color for a redhead because i would buy it.",5
As-advertised crop sweater is a great length. design is an iron-on velvet texture rather than intarsia. weight of sweater is great for transitional weather.,5
Just loved it at first sight and waited for it to come on sale .. i am usually a size 0 or xsmall but this one fits perfectly with a size 2 .. i am about 122 lbs and 5 ft 2 and this size fits really well - - petite is too short esp on the arms -- the lining is really nice as well - the design and the cut of this coat is really flattering unlike some of the boxy designs -- absolutely divine - just loved it !!,5
The best shirt to throw on with a pair of shorts and it's effortlessly adorable!,5
"I have been wanting this coat ever since i tried it on in the store a month ago. it's beautiful and well-made. it fits tts, but a snug tts, so if you are between sizes, i would order up. grab this asap while the price is right and it is still available!",5
"This is a great shirt to wear with jeans or pants. i love the tucks in front with brass buttons. you don't have to unbutton all of them as the shirt slides easily over your head, i love the pattern and it is a great look for fall and later on winter . i think this will be my go-to shirt this season.",5
"This coat won't take me through a cold boston winter, but i will be willing to sacrifice a little warmth in order to take this beauty out for a night on the town. it's chic, slim, elongating and bold. it looks fantastic paired with some bold tall boots and solid colors underneath. as for sizing, i tend to disagree with most ""runs small"" reviews, but this baby runs small. especially if you really do live in a cold climate and intend to wear something substantial underneath. my bust measurement is",5
"I picked this up during the bf promo and very happy to find my size 10. i was watching this coat, i call this really a topper, because it is not heavy and finishes an outfit, i went up to a size 10 because it runs slim as noted in the description and the reviews. i find this piece to be a reminder of the old retailer pieces i have collected over the years ( since 2001!) my chest is a 34dd and even then the 10 is snug. i can't wait to wear this bold statement piece, i purchased the bailly 44 navy p",5
"This skirt is so much better in person than in the pictures. fit is true to size, perfect drape, lined & not clingy, just perfect in every way. it's at such a decent price point too that i think it will sell out--grab it now in your size while you can! 

only ""con"" i can think of is that it might be a bit long for petite sizes, but maybe they make it in petite...?",5
"I bought this shirt in a l, since i didn't want it to be too fitted and was concerned a m would be. it is so boxy! it's like a completely different shirt. i have no idea how it looks good on anyone, unless it is simply widened the larger the size. maybe a m wouldn't be as wide and therefore as boxy, but this shirt is just a bad mess. returning.",1
"I have a couple of these tanks so i thought i would try the tshirt and its even more flattering than the tanks (which i also love) great material, doesnt stretch out like you would think it would and looks great with shorts or pants.",5
"This is an awesome t'shirt and i'm so glad it finally went on sale. i had been eying it for a while: it's true to size, can be dressed up with nice slacks or dressed down with boyfriend jeans. washes great and looks different from other shirts -- the ruffles on the bottom really make a difference. gotten lots of compliments.",5
"I bought this very cute t-shirt in sky. wore it once, then washed it according to the washing instuctions (machine washable/dryable). this t-shirt turned into a crop top!!!!! i can't wear it. it's going to goodwill. i would suggest that you air dry this shirt, if you want to take the chance that it won't shrink up several inches.",1
"I picked this dress up from the sales rack at retailer and immediately fell in love when i tried it on. the colors are prettier in person. the cut on the top is a little snug. my bust size is 32b and i got the size 2. i can see the top being an issue for bustier women. overall, wonderful quality and design! i'm wearing it today to combat the 90 degree+ weather.",5
"This sweater is really beautiful! i love this brand and this piece is one of their best yet! the fringe is perfect and flowy, a sweater that you can team with jeans and boots and be the best dressed in the room. tts, soft with no itch, really happy i bought it, and because of the color and weight this is an all year sweater which i love, because i know i will not want to pack it away. it fits just like the photo.",5
"Gorgeous print on light weight layers in a cut that's flattering, feminine & fun.  i sized up and ordered the the 12p to fit my large rounded rib cage & 36dds.  i agree with previous reviewers that the bodice runs small.  i will add that the neckline is tight if you have a fat neck like mine.  stats are 5'3'' 140# 36dd 8/10 on top, 6/8 on bottom.",5
"I'm a size 2 in retailer pretty much across the board - size 26/27 bottom, 2 top, generally go for the xs. and i ordered this in a 4 based on other reviews. it's definitely not a winter coat, which i understood. it's not for layering over a heavy sweater either. i wish i had ordered the size 2 instead so that it was a little snugger in the waist. as is i can wear it over a shirt, dress, or light sweater, and that's fine, but unlike other reviewers i don't think you need to size up if you want the",5
"I knew i would keep it as soon as i put it on -- comfortable, beautiful fabric, cute gold buttons!  as well, due to the cut, it feels roomy, but has a slender fit around the arms.  the ""denim"" color has beautiful detail, but i don't think i would like the maroon solid.  i wish there was another nonsolid color -- i would buy another one!",5
"From unique shape to feminine design, this cropped summer sweater is the kind of item that attracted me to retailer thirteen years ago.  it's also flattering, especially for this petite, who doesn't like to show her upper arms.",5
"This coat is just as nice as the russian one from a few years ago, and fits the same. it is stunning! i swear, life is way too short to wear only average coats. if you are a parks and recreation fan, think back to the treat yo self episode.....and you'll know what i mean! i can't say enough wonderful things about this one.",5
"This is the kind of blouse you want at your reach when dressing on a humid day. cotton enhanced with beautiful detail. a very classic timeless, ageless piece. i bought the medium, which fits perfectly (size 8 top, 34f). my only ding is that the neck opening should be stitched less deep; there is a gap. funny thing is that, in the photo, the model's blouse is pinned exactly where i'm talking about. i didn't take off a star because i had a dressmaker fix the problem, but this was annoying. i wore",5
I saw this shirt on a friend and had to buy it right away! it has the comfort of a regular tee but the frills at the bottom give it that retailer look! true to size.,5
"I bought this top in the store where i found they had a beautiful mint color not shown here. i think the length is perfect. so many of the tees, etc. are extra long, so it's nice to have a variety to chose from. i'm 5'5"" and this little tee hits right where my legs begin. it is very free flowing and cool. i own several similar tees and tanks from this line and they are great when the weather gets hot.",5
"Love this! it's loose and easy for summer, fabric is not too sheer. the asymmetrical ruffle is such a cute feature. washes well. i got the pink for myself (though it's a deep coral color - perfect for me) and the gray for my daughter. wish they'd had the powder blue when i bought ours; i'd have bought that color for her instead.",5
"There may be no inner lining, but it is a gorgeous bra! and so comfortable! the straps and well make and sturdy and the detailing is stunning. it is absolutely true to size. 34c fit like a glove. a winner!",5
"I love this coat! i purchased the size 6. i am a size 6 petite, but they were out. plus i wanted the coat to be a little longer. i wasn't a fan of how high it was on the model. it fit as i expected. i will have to take up the arm length, and it hit a little longer than it did on the model. i am 5' 120 pounds. 34c

the quality is what i expected. it's excellent with lining. color is as shown. this coat will go with everything! i plan to dress it up and down. i purchased the ""orange"" pants and the",5
"As other reviewers said, this top is rather boxy. but i assumed it ran big, ordered a size down, & i love it. i ended up buying it in both black & white. personally, i don't find it too short. it hits (on me) just below the waist of my jeans - it covers up my tummy - which no one needs to see - but still looks youthful. the little ruffle detail & front seam take it from boring basic to something special enough to feel put together by just pairing with cute jeans. i generally wear a 14 & 38dd bra",5
"I bought this dress for an awards ceremony, and couldn't be more pleased. the quality and detailing on the dress are great, and the hidden side zipper makes the dress easy to put on. i love that it's machine washable on a delicate setting. i've already worn it twice, and can't wait to wear it again for easter.",5
This is the perfect tank for everyday but it looks like you've dressed up a bit. i love the flow and the ruffles and it looks super cute with a pair of skinny pants. really comfortable and it is good quality.,5
"This dress is lovely. the embroidery is beautifully done and with bright colors. the material is sturdy. the fit is overall true to size but slightly small through the bust. the length is several inches above my knees and i ordered the 6 regular even though i am only 5'4"". the pockets are a bonus!",5
This is beautiful dress with great fit. i agree with other reviewers that the top is small but works well for my small bust size. the fabric is heavy giving the dress a more sophisticated feel.,5
This is so amazing! the dress is solid and will go under many different jackets kimonos and sweaters!,5
"I bought this to wear to holiday parties, but it would work for any special occasion. the embroidery is gorgeous and really pops on the black background. the dress itself is a brushed cotton that is thick enough to not to show every bulge. i said it runs tts. i bought the size 2 and normally would wear a 2 or 4 in retailer dresses. the dress is fitted through the torso and flairs at the hips, so you may want to size up or down depending on your body type.. i did not have any issue with the armhole",5
"This was a rare full-price purchase for me. i do think that it runs slightly large, but that is part of the ""look"" of this dress. i considered sizing down to an xs for more definition at the waist, but they didn't have one in store so i decided to stick with my regular s. i look forward to wearing this with sandals while summer is still sweltering, but i also think it will transition well with tights, boots, and a cardigan when temps start cooling off.",5
"This is a great, versatile everyday tee. the fit is flattering, and the material is soft and lightweight. this, like many retailer tops, runs large under the arms. i first tried the medium, and although i liked the way the tee hung, it gapped in my underarms. there was no small in my store, so i tried on the xs. it still hung nicely, and no underarm gap. love the simple colors - denim blue and gray is a great combination. liked it enough to pay full price:)",5
"Pictures don't do this dress justice, color in store is much more vibrant! embroidered flower is more orange/coral colored. also, at certain angles (depending on the lighting) this dress looks navy blue versus black, which i enjoyed. sizing - while i could have gotten away with my usual 8 the side view was too voluminous and somewhat unflattering so i ended up sizing down to a 6 for a more tailored look.",5
"I usually wear a size small in deletta. i am 5'5"" and 140 pounds. the small ran true to size for me. saying that i am a size 8 so usually everywhere else i can take small or medium, so i can see how reviewers say it runs big. love the ruffles on this tank. makes it a little more special. super comfy and easy to wear. will be great for hot summer days in florida!",5
This is a really pretty top that you can dress up or down. the draping on the neck and shoulders falls nicely and i love the back with the lace. it is simple but unique and has nice classic lines. i am usually a pxs but based on the measurements i went with the regular xxs and glad i did bc the petite would have been too short.,5
"In agreement with all the reviewers before me, this dress is gorgeous!
i am 5'4"" 120lbs 34a and got this is in a size 0 and it fits perfectly but i would be in a little bit of trouble if i were significantly larger up top, so if you are, definitely size up.
the material is thick, structured and very well made. every time i wear this out i get a ton of compliments!
one of my favorite parts about it is the intricate embroidery on the neck-line that gives the illusion that you are wearing a necklac",5
"This is a soft, comfortable shirt. it fits like a t-shirt should. i usually buy m but based on other reviews i purchased s. the fit on me in size small is similar to the model in the photo.",5
"I ordered this on a whim during the 40% discount upon sale price. i was a bit worried it looked like a burlap sack initially, but after trying it on with an under tank and leggings i decided it was a keeper. its quite soft and is flattering. i usually wear a medium, got the m/l and fits well.",5
I absolutely love this dress. the pattern is gorgeous and it is so comfortable. i have received many compliments every time i wear it. i will definitely start paying more attention to this brand when shopping retailer.,5
"This is the perfect dress for going out and wearing to work (with a jacket or sweater and boots). it fits perfectly across the bust and waist and then has enough room to glide over the hips.
the material is structured enough to give me a nice curvy shape and the embroidery is well done and beautiful. my husband picked this out from the catalog and loved it on me as well.",5
"I like this top because it covers the bum.  it is a little longer in the back than front.  it is cotton modal soft, and it is light enough for summer.  the ruffles add nice flow and fun detail. i bought this piece because it will make a nice top to wear in the summer, but classier than a tank top.  i also knew it would make a nice layering piece under a sweater in the winter.  i buy all my clothing pieces now based on versatility, material (for comfort), and classical style.",5
"This dress has the same bold, great color as the picture. although it has a big ""swing"" to it, because the upper portion is a bit fitted, i don't feel like i look pregnant. the material is extremely well done and i like the above the knee styling. i'm very happy i bought it.",5
Love embroidery!,5
"This dress is gorgeous. i tried it on in the store several weeks ago and loved it, but the cost was a deterrent. when it went on sale, i ordered it immediately. hoping it gets here soon! the fit is wonderful, length perfect, embroidery just beautiful, and quality is excellent. it is versatile, too; easy to dress down with a sweater and boots, and beautiful for a more formal event like a wedding. for fit reference, i am 5'8"", 130 lb and ordered size 6 (this was the correct fit in the store). exci",5
"I just wore this dress tonight to my holiday party and received many compliments on it. it's so comfortable and even though the fabric is thick, it's not bulky or stiff like some embroidered fabric can be. and the side pockets make a great addition too. unlike other reviews, i thought the armholes were perfect. the cutout in the back is a nice touch, and i was able to wear a regular bra with it. the colors are beautiful and true to the pic, i was not surprised by the ""brightness"" of it like othe",5
"Is it possible to be in love with a dress? i think so and i am. when i put this dress on it literally took my breath away. it is beautiful and very well-made. this dress is so fun! i wore it to an event this past weekend and received more compliments than i ever have on something i'm wearing. this beauty is so incredibly comfortable and bonus - it has pockets! i am a petite 4 and it runs very true to size for me. in the store, it looked more navy than black, but as i have it home, it is definite",5
I loved this shirt until the first time i washed it. it shrunk so much it became unwearable. when i returned it the salesperson said she had also bought this shirt and the same thing happened.,1
I wore this dress to work with a tan pair of booties and the compliments started upon entry and did not stop till the end of the day. very feminine and comfy all at once.,5
"I was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store. but, i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric, which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash (even when following washing instructions). i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially! i'm so disappointed. how can you make a shirt that can't withstand washing?!",1
"This is one of those just throw on and go dresses that i love. it is breezy and easy, comfortable, but also polished and lovely with some really nice design features and a beautiful mixed print. you can wear it with some cute flip-flops, or polish it up with some cute boots.",5
Wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased and wore two of these. washed as directed and same outcome as everyone else. basically unwearable unless i maybe use it for a nightshirt. the shrinkage lengthwise was ridiculous. glad i didn't buy every color like i had planned to do!,1
So disappointing! everything i've owned from bordeaux has washed well and stood the test of time. one wash and this was ruined! shrunk terrible even after washing in cold water on delicate and laying flat to dry. completely ruined. returned it.,1
"This is beautiful - the colors are rich (though the pink is slightly more noticeable than the model image. the length was just shy of my knees at 5'7"", and the fit was overall swingy. i am happy with my normal size s, though i would be curious to see how the xs fits too. i suspect that it would be too tight in the shoulders but fit everywhere else better. one major difference that slightly annoys me is that the sleeves are not long as shown in the model shot. the flared portion starts at about m",5
"Adorable, old school retailer; the only gripe i have is trying to get this on. the slip is similar to putting on a straight jacket. once you figure it out, then it's gorgeous. just be careful and lay it out carefully before you pull it over your head.",5
"Stunning! i got about 6 compliments the day i wore it. 2 different men i barely know said ""you're really rocking that outfit."" 

i wish they made this in petite as the xs is slightly big (i'm 5'3"" 106 lbs) but i kept it anyway since i'm both a little underweight right now and also since i was able to roll the top so that it was an appropriate length to wear with flats. 

i paired with a denim shirt- perfection.",5
"Love, love, love this dress! the fabric is high quality; the colors are rich and vibrant. the fit is very flattering, with the open neckline and fitted waist. versatile piece that can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or dressed down with tights and boots. my usual size fits perfectly.",5
This top is very cute but runs large. i am a 32b and i had to take the xsmall. the back of the bathing suit only has one slot for closing it up so you can't adjust it.,5
It's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it's shape. very disappointed. i am going to return top.,1
"As the previous reviewer stated, this skirt is a stunner, can be worn in all four season. it's long and runs on the larger side. so that you compare, i'm 5'9"" and it goes all the way to the side of my foot. i'm 146lbs, 28 waist, 38 hips and always a medium on maeve, this skirt on a medium was too big for me, at least a size larger. take that into account when ordering. other than that it's a great purchase. can't wait for my exchange to arrive.",5
"This skirt has a more dusty black background than the website lets on, which i love. the floral pattern is delicate and subtle, and the tiers give this gorgeous skirt the perfect amount of flounce. it is so versatile! the quality is excellent. the skirt is fully lined. it will take me easily through three seasons (the weight of it might make it a bit too warm for summer). i'm so happy i bought this!",5
How can you go wrong with soft cotton top that is neither too snug nor too loose? expect will wear these as layers under when really cold and by them selves in early spring and in the fall. great colors and love the multiple textures.,5
"This dress is so fun and very comfy! the slip it comes with pulls the whole dress together! it has been great for warm fall days, but i can see it being warn with leggings and boots into the winter. i love the combination of blocked deep colors along side of pastels. i'm 5'5"" and the length is just right, not too short.",5
"I loved this shirt when i got it. it fit perfectly, and was so soft. but when i washed it, following the instructions, it shrank up to well above my belly button. i'm talking 6 inches of shrinkage, at least.",1
"This skirt has a beautiful, flattering feminine fit. the floral pattern is delicate and a little different and, of course, the layers are what make this piece a stunner. i highly recommend it. can see wearing this all year, dressed up with jewels, or down with boots and a casual sweater.",5
"I got this skirt because its elegant and can be worn in three seasons. it is stylish and can easily be dressed up or down. i usually wear an xs in bottoms and this runs about one size large in the waist area. still, i am keeping it and plan to have it altered. it is cute and completely worth the extra effort",5
"Love the fabric, fits true to size, great quality.",5
"Love this length, print and material! have already worn 2 times and wears and washes well! sleeves are short than pic shows but i don't mind...",5
Bought two of these because i loved the way they fit off of the rack. washed them according to directions and they were ruined. the material shrank up making the shirt short and boxy and the side panels ended up being rippled. definitely going to try to return these.,1
I thought these were great everyday shirts for the price. i got them on sale over christmas. they fit well and i really love the striped shirt. the navy is an odd color and looks strange with jeans but i love the top regardless,5
"I picked this up this weekend. so gorgeous! i usually don't do maxi length. at 5'3"" it can be overwhelming. but this is so flattering! this is floor length on me. i picked up a couple tops at another store because the suggested sweaters were just too baggy for my frame. i'll pair it with a cream blouse (pictured) to dress up and a pink crepe blouse and denim jacket for a more casual look. i'm usually a 4 and the small fits perfectly.",5
"This beautiful, soft, swingy, dress is oversized on me.  usually when someone reviews that a dress runs large but their body type is opposite mine, i pick tts and 90% of the time i'm right.  not so in this case. the outer dress is very wide and the amazing super stretchy under slip is too large also.  debating on sizing down because of potential shrinkage after laundering.  i bought m and my stats are 5'3"" 140# 39/28/35.  dress ends just above my knees.


agreeing with the previous reviews th",5
"When the top arrived and i tried it on; it was great. the length was perfect even though i am curvy. after one wash (done according to the directions), the top shrank in length considerably. i do not mind paying a higher price for something unique and something of quality.....i do have a problem with something that does not hold up to basic use. i will be returning this item.",1
Loved this dress but ran much larger than other maeve dresses i have ordered in the past!,5
"Wonderful fabric. surprisingly great fit. super flattering. i'm so glad i bought it, despite jumpsuits being a bit of a risk online.",5
"It was the color that prompted me to take this dress to the fitting room. as seen in the photos, it is a deep burgundy or dark maroon. though the color is deep and rich, the design of the dress makes it lighter and easily able to be worn during the heat of the summer. 

in the later months of summer and early fall, i will wear this dress without leggings for a transitional look. when the temps cool down, though, i will wear leggings or tights throughout the winter with the dress. it will easil",5
"These are nice dusty rose pants. they have a great textured design on them. they will look nice with a plain white tee or chambray shirt for brunch! i will say they are not soft like sweatpants, definitely feel like a poly-blend but the look makes up for it. the material is a little on the thin side and they are not lined....but not see-through either.",5
"I tried on and bought this shirt in my usual size and it fit long and loose but still had great shape. after hand washing in cold water and air drying, as per instructions on the tag, the shirt shrunk significantly. so much so that my stomach shows if i raise my arms at all. it also lost its shape, and now looks very boxy and is very unflattering. i won't be wearing it and am disappointed i didn't even get to wear it once!",1
I wear cardigans pretty much every day since my office is chilly and i need something a little dressier to be able to wear that will keep me warm. i love the design of this cardigan which makes it very flattering-the longer in front is a style i gravitate toward and i like that the back isn't just straight but it has that little flair-this is not something that is commonly seen in a cardigan (unless it is short all the way around) and it was great attention to detail by the designer. i like the,5
"I really like this top, it is form fitting and i think true to size that i would normally wear. i do not think the v-neck is too low so that i would feel comfortable wearing this even to work. i was surprised at how thick the fabric was, but i am typically cold so i like this feature. the criss-cross design in the front and back of this garment is very flattering and i get a lot of compliments whenever i wear this piece.",5
"I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular size 27 (5'4"", 27/35, 116bs) and they fit me just perfect so they are tts. they are super soft and there's just enough stretch in these that i'm able to bend easily yet they retain their shape nicely. the pockets in the front are super cute in person and the back gives a really cute look. the color is just as shown in the picture, a nice shade of blue that's in the middle plus they are really incredibly soft. i'm only 5""4"" but found the regular",5
"I normally wear a xs, but i got a small so it would be a little longer. great quality and adorable!",5
"I definitely agree with the other reviews, however i really like this skirt because it will go with a variety of tops to dress it up, or down, as well as color options. the tricky thing is that it runs super small. i'm usually between a 6, or 8 (28/29), and ended up getting a size 10. i don't like high waisted skirts or pants, so it sits just below my navel and is very comfortable. maybe best to try on in store, but worth it!",5
"I wasn't sure about the color but ordered based on how much my stylist loved it. my usual xs petite fits perf daly, no chest problem (30dd) and the length is quite nice. romantic look, the drawstring in the back helps making sure the dress fits properly at the waist. it is a high low style with flowy skirt. overall great. i need to stop going to the store""",5
"I love love love this cardigan!! i ordered it in plum, regular small as they were out of petite small ( my preferred size). i was very impressed with the quality of the cardigan. the details like the sheer fabric around the neckline are very delicate and beautiful. the waist line sits exactly where it should. i was worried it would sit too low as i am short and did not get this in petite sizing. so maybe i should say this cardigan runs small. i think i have found the perfect cardigan. it goes wi",5
"I ordered the blue in size xl. it's even prettier in person. the fit runs a little smaller/shorter on me than shown on the model. i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. i love the detailed stitching. it is delicate and can catch. my dog's claw pulled on it and i had to reweave the thread back. i've washed mine twice, reshaped & air-dried. it didn't shrink much at all. it's perfect for spring & summer. i've gotten a lot of compliments on the shade of blue. it's really so pretty.",5
"I love this top and bought it in both colors. what's really fun is that i found a pair of espadrille sandals to match the sandy beige and white colored top and i have attached a photo of me under my arbor to show you. these tops are designed to have a flattering fit. i ordered size small and they are not too tight. i am 36 c in the bust line and an hour glass figure on bottom. i love that they are off the shoulder a bit and in a v neck, which is flattering on me. the material is soft and of good",5
"I was hesitant to try this top on because i thought it might be too tight, and then was delighted to find that it is so comfortable and flattering. i am usually a m and the m fit me great. i have to disagree with another reviewer that this top is for those of us b cup or smaller. i am a d and it fit me great. it's got enough give and support (great fabric and wrap design) to fit a wide range of bust lines. it's a great blend of being attractive without being too revealing. i love it. got it in b",5
"This is a very substantial, warm sweater that is so classy and super soft and just different enough. really great with neutral sweater leggings or jeans with boots. you have to wear a longer tank or tee underneath as it it split on the sides but the belt cinches the whole sweater in.",5
"Love this skirt its like a denim feel so there is good structure, love the colors anything goes with it, and i love pockets very comfortable day skirt for just around town",5
"I purchased this sweater in the grey and loved it.
much prettier in person, the photos do not show the delicate details, which are lovely.
i found that it fits true to size and has a very flattering fit.
it is also a very versatile piece depending on what you pair it with.
i love it so much that i purchased the peach and wine colors as well.
i found all 3 colors beautiful and each gives this sweater a different look.
the grey is sophisticated and works well with almost anything.
the peach is del",5
"The gorgeous coral color of this skirt makes it a great all seasons skirt. the slightly heavier weight of skirt makes it extremely adorable for fall/winter. pair it with some tights, chunky knit and booties, good to go. very flattering one. has a slight a-line cut to it. i love love this one.",5
This is such a nice little sweater to add to a dress or tank. fits true to size and i love the tie and hook and eye closure. quality.,5
"I saw this in the store, not on sale and loved it. was so happy when it went on sale! it is beautifully made and is soft and cozy.",5
"I love it! it's cute and short and shows off my legs. the material is thick and great quality, so great for the fall. the color is great for florida!!! brightness year round. it's fits perfectly. i purchased a 14 and it fits like a glove. i am going to wear with my booties and a jacket like the model. hey it works!!!",5
"I love these pjs! i thought $100 for the set was a little too pricey for me but as soon as they went on sale i knew i had to have them! they are so light and fresh, perfect for the texas heat! it helps that the print is absolutely precious as well!",5
A really great basic that can be styled a number of ways. i bought it in tan and white and received many compliments on it. the slightly off the shoulder look is really flattering and perfect for a spring or summer look.,5
"I purchased both the floral sleep shorts and the top. the floral watercolor pattern is gorgeous and the fabric is very soft. like the other reviewers, i appreciate the feminine quality of this set while also being able to run around the house. i am 135 lbs and purchased a s.",5
"Love this top the crossover design is so cute. i ordered by normal xs (5'5"" 110 lbs) and was worried it wouldn't fit right in the chest (34 d) but it does and even though it's cut on the lower side it's made so there is no gap in the shirt when you bend over. has a little elastic in there to keep everything together. perfect length and nice thicker material got the navy and red stripe and with white jeans is so cute!",5
"What can i say? it's like wearing a hug. it's so wonderful i have a hard time taking it off at the end of the day! it's extraordinarily soft and thick, and stylish to boot! the one thing is that the thread holding the pockets together was already coming unraveled when i took it out of the package, and i had to sew them back on right away, as they were starting to come completely apart. a small price to pay for being a new owner of the best thing ever.",5
"I love the ruching on this hoodie, which is why i ordered it. i'm typically a size small, 34b, 130lbs but the hoodie was a bit tight in the waist and around the bottom band. i might order it in a medium (although the sleeves will likely be too long) the only thing that makes me hesitate is the color. it's more of a brown gray (instead of just gray as you see on your computer screen.).",5
"Tried it on a whim and could not leave it behind. 5/4', 135, size 4-6, took a 6. something about the pocket placement, fabric weight, cut, and color make this one a real winner for me. plan to wear it with a creme windowpane coat.",5
This is the softest jacket! i could sleep in this fabric. the ruched details and fun collar make it unique. plus it has inside pockets! one of the best finds in a while.,5
I found this fit tts for me. i'm normally a 10/12 and took a 12. fit and length are great. the fabric felt substantial and the colors are soft.,5
"The colors are so pretty, a pinkish brown and a light brown trim. it is very soft and elegant looking. great with jeans or leggings. the tie is a little high in back but looks great. highly recommend!",5
"This top is the bomb. the red is a perfect balance of washed out but still rich. the thin spaghetti straps and scooped back make it sexy, but it still looks effortless. perfect to pair with light weight, light wash jeans. it's also nice that it's not clingy at all, lends to the casual look. total keep for me.",5
This fabric feels a little bit like heaven. i would totally wear this out and not just with my jammies. it's adorable and the fabric is so soft. i think i'm in love. i'm 5'2 95 lbs. xxsmall was a perfect fit.,5
"I love this sweater! i ordered the dark gray and wasn't expecting fabulous but that's what i got. the skirt below the waist tie is actually pleated so that it falls perfectly. the seaming detail is beautiful. i am between a size large and extra large and the extra large fit perfectly. the sweater is short, half way down my hips but looks good over a long tank. this a medium weight knit and will be wearable all year with skirts, dresses and any kind of trousers. this is one of my favorite purchas",5
"Loved the red and white stripes and soft fabric, lays nicely has a nice cut. pairs well with jeans and a cute casual jacket or dress it up. nice quality and color!",5
"Bought the red/white. normally a size small but they were out so tried a medium. it fit perfectly. and feels amazing. love how it hangs and know i will get lots of compliments on this! jeans, white linen pants, very versatile how this can be warn.",5
Wow! love this skirt! and i totally agree with reviewers--this item runs a full size small. i am normally a true six on bottom and it was a bit too tight considering i would wash/dry/shrink. the size eight is perfect. fabric is very good twill and forgiving... $19.95 and 40% off!!! cannot wait to wear my bargain skirt next summer!!!,5
"Love this shirt, great fabric and fit. trying to wait for a sale to buy several others in additional colors.",5
"It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however, i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.",1
"Can't wait for the weather to cool so i can wear this! the split back makes it very flattering. 

the 'green' is definitely more brown.",5
"On sale this is a great deal. the structure and fit of it are perfect- maybe runs a tad big, but i liked that- it's supposed to be a snug fit, and is, without being too clingy. i chose the berry color and love it- the ribbed style of fabric wasn't as visible in the pic online but i don't mind it in the darker color. can be worn with a bit of flair by unbuttoning the turtleneck or kept classic by not-",5
"This is a great sweater that i know i'll get a ton of use out of! i've already worn it three times, and i've had it a week. i typically wear small or medium in tops and sweaters, and ordered a medium in this one to ensure the arms were comfortable. the nude color is perfect.",5
"I love this sweater. i purchased it in the red/berry color. it is so incredibly soft and cozy and the fit is fantastic! it hugs my curves in all the right places! i purchased it without even looking at the care instructions. but, after reading a couple of reviews here, i opted to wash on delicate and line dry. it came out perfectly!",5
"I have a long list of criteria for this sort of a top. the lace can't be too fragile, the top can't be too see through, it can't bind my arms in an uncomfortable way and it can't be dry clean only. the stars have aligned on this one! i bought my usual size 2 and it fits tts. i only wish it was a little longer but i will probably wear it layered with a long cami. it certainly seems worth it for full price.",5
"I've only worn the sweater a handful of times, but i'm already in love with how soft and comfortable it is. it's a bit on the baggier side, but that doesn't stop it from looking great. i've gotten complements on it every time i've worn it. i would highly recommend it to people who don't like the typical scratchy/itchy textiles.",5
This has quickly become my go-to cardigan! it's light which will make it great for the spring and summer nights. i got it in the rose... and loved it so much i bought the olive too. bought a small- fits perfectly! arm length is great too.,5
"I wear this top all the time! perfect with jeans and can't wait to wear with a skirt in the summer.
i am 5'2 and have the xs which hits in a great length, just as pictured. i bought at full price, so for the sale price you are getting a great deal!",5
"I have countless ag jeans but this has become my current favorite. i love cuffed jeans and actually ordered the two washes for this style. the lighter one which is getting rave reviews i actually returned because of too much distressing and stretch. i like this darkly uniform shade, slimming and more office appropriate for casual fridays. you need to size up on your usual ag size, however, to get the perfect fit.",5
"Usually wear a small, sometimes medium. bought this in medium and am very happy with it. form-fitting but not too tight. would probably fit well in a small, if i was in better shape. it does show any flaws, so the medium is more forgiving. bought the black and am considering the neutral stripe. this is a great, medium weight top for cooler days. the snap collar looks nice open. i plan on washing on delicate and hanging up to dry. i never dry clean anything except wool suits and coats.",5
All i really need to say is this is the perfect layering piece. i love that you have a choice in the neckline that you want to wear. form flattering and is true to size.,5
"I am always a fan of retailer cardigans, but this one exceeded my expectations. the quality is a work of art, especially the back and the color, i chose the green, is so unique and beautiful. you will not be disappointed, go for it!",5
"I technically measure to a medium in both regular and petite sizing, but i took a chance an ordered the regular small in red. it is as depicted, and i agree that it is soft and can be clingy, but the regular size fits slightly too big on me. this is fine since it would show lumps otherwise. i bet this would be perfect had the petite size have been available. nonetheless, the fabric is substantial enough that it doesn't show the fact i carry weight in my upper body and stomach, so i'm keeping it.",5
I got this in the royal blue.it is absolutly beautiful.,5
Loved the fit. the size was true and it felt so soft on.,5
"I loved this top when i tried it on in the store. i was very close to buying, but i knew my sister would want, so i moved on. it is a great fitting top. i am 5'7, 125lbs, and the small fit perfectly. i do question how well this top will fit petite people.",5
I love this top so much i bought it in 3 colors. the material is so soft and comfortable. has a slight fitting in the waist to make it very flattering. you can wear the next as pictured or button it up and slouch it and it looks great both ways. perfect with jeans or dress it up with slacks. just wish it wasn't dry clean only.,5
"Got this for work (my style is casual to boho) and it turned out to be my go-to cardigan.
the color is soft and pretty. it drapes perfectly. got the x-small
and it fits beautifully. plus, the weight of the knit is just right for
chilly evenings. would love to have it in more colors!",5
"This top is lace done extremely well, i love the silk, the double attached layer, and the length. dress it up or down, this top is a definite show stopper.
it does run small in the arms though, size up!",5
Lovely drape and design. true to size. more of a muted crimson/brick color.,5
"I ordered the blue in size 16. it ran at least two, if not three, sizes too small compared to my other retailer 14 & 16 blouses. it was too small through the body, other than the peplum. the arms were tight too. the waistline and length matched the online photos. it's widening. the material they chose was also scratchy and rough, especially around the neckline. i returned mine after trying it on and seeing there was no way to make this work. the blue color was gorgeous though. the patterned lace w",1
I love this top! the unique neck detail is awesome! i dress it up; i dress it casual. works for every adventure. more!!!,5
"Loved the look, fit and styling of this turtleneck. but dry clean only, you have to be kidding?",1
Absolutely love this shirt. i purchased this in the black and blue. perfect for holiday parties.,5
"High quality, great color, loved the neckline. unfortunately a little too snug on me so it showed my bulges on waist and back. not too snug if you don't have that problem. i loved this shirt but had to return it.",5
"I was very pleased with this purchase. lovely print, good fit, and silky fabric.",5
I didn't think it was that cute in the picture online but when i saw it in the store i was in love!  i am typically a medium and this was true with this.  i have a 34dd chest and you can wear a strapless easily with it and it doesn't show. i am going to wear it for a cocktail party but it would work with flip flops too.  just love it so happy i went into the store and saw it.,5
Love this shirt. i have a bit of a tummy so i usually don't buy shorter shirts but with my high waisted denim and skirts it looks great.,5
Pretty delicate lace top...love it! hits right at waist so not unflattering at hips.,5
"5,7"" , 138 pound,, 73 year old grandmother. can't wear wool and always looking for stylish cotton/linen sweaters.

"This bra is the one. i have been searching high and low to replace my worn out comfy bra, and this is it. if you are looking for a wireless bra with thin straps that can peek out from your shirt and not announce themselves as hello bra straps, a v-neck cut (none of that scoop cut nonsense), and you don't care about trying to boost your cleavage, this bra has it all. so comfy too.",5
"I like the weight of this sweater. it breathes a little but the knit isn't too thin. it is a little see-through, so i like to stick to solids underneath it. it's just a cleaner look than seeing pattern peeking through. great rose color.",5
I bought this cardigan in both rose and nude and i absolutely love both! the weight is perfect for spring and fall and i love the details in the back and the pockets. i thought the rose would be hard to match for tops but i have a number of things that work with it. it fits true to size in my opinion.,5
"Like the last reviewer i saw these pants in the store and decided to give them a try. i'm glad i did because i absolutely love them and they were the last pair on the rack. the fabric is nice and light, perfect for warm summer evenings and the pattern is really pretty almost like a watercolor painting. this is my third pair of sleep pants by elouise and i absolutely love them all.",5
"These pants are beautiful. great fit and great fabric. really comfortable and elegant. i am tall 5'8"" and have a long torso so it's nice to find pants that are high waisted.",5
"It's very beautifully designed, simple but elegant. material is thick and soft so it makes good shape. color is a little different from picture but it didn't disappoint me because everything else is so good.",5
This is the best! i have the black and striped version and wear them weekly. great layering piece and also for fitting so they look great with skinny jeans. i love the snaps. i saw this at full price but waited for the sale so that i could get more than one!!! now i just need the gray one...,5
One of the most beautiful sweaters i've ever seen. i love it!,5
"I bought this cardigan to take on a trip to the middle east. it turned out to be a great purchase. the weight of the sweater is substantial enough to add warmth and not just style. i am not a huge fan of light-weight sweaters as i tend to be chilly all the time. i was concerned that the design of the back might accentuate my rounder backside, however it drapes very nicely. i am petite 5'1"" with moderate curves. i typically get the xxsp and this was perfect. the neutral color is great with almost",5
"Fell in love with the design of this sweater. its lightweight, appropriately sized, with delicate details. the pockets are somewhat hidden which is a nice feature. the shawl collar falls just right. the unique design in the rear makes it stand out from your standard cardigan. i purchased in rose for a rich color addition to my wardrobe. the xs fit perfectly. i'm 5'3 and typically wear xs in retailer tops.",5
Great light weight sweater. perfect for spring. runs true to size. definitely will buy another color.,5
"I bought this in a size 0 which is my usual retailer size. the lace is nice quality, not rough or scratchy. i purchased the ivory which does have some blush accents which make it look ""vintagey"". it will be perfect for the holidays or all fall/winter. i like that the peplum doesn't seem to flair out much. very pretty!",5
"I bought this shirt in black and it goes with everything. definitely runs large-i have big boobs and bought the xl and returned it for the large which was even still a bit too big (long running in the sleeves) though i was comfortable with keeping it. it's a soft, comfortable shirt. the snap detail is quirky and allows multiple looks/ styling. i love the shirt and i'm glad i got in on it while i did.",5
Loved this cute dress. so easy and simple to wear. i wore it with tan/nude sandals to keep it casual for the race track in saratoga. so comfortable. for this price it is a must have.,5
I love this turtleneck so much!! got it in black. looks great with skirts and under sweaters. love that you can wear the collar two ways. drapes and clings perfectly. the silver snaps along collar are such a nice detail. details like this is what makes retailer pieces so unique. love it! i am usually an xs or small in tops. 34b bra size. i ended up with the xs.,5
This is a great sweater. it's lightweight and very comfortable. i bought a medium but really could use a small. medium still worked well though.,5
"The quality of he fabric is amazing. the thickness is perfect as to look form fitting while not too tight or thin showing any ""wrinkles."" i had been searching for a versatile turtleneck i could dress up or down a finding this was a definite win! the style is timeless and with the high quality i know this will be a staple for years to come.",5
The shirts fits well. it is very soft and stretchy but thick enough that it's not see through. the collar is the best part. i wear small and i'm 5'3.,5
"Purchased this fun, feminine top right before vacation and wanted to wear it every single day. the peplum style isn't typically something i gravitate to, but this peplum is the perfect length and i love the sheer 3/4 length sleeves. i chose the ivory version of this top and it was adorable with jeans, oxfords & a cute hat. for how beautiful this top is, i feel like the price tag is an absolute steal!",5
"I saw the cream top online and loved it, but it is even prettier in person. i typically purchase petite sizes online, but i tried on the 0 in the store and it fit nicely-- not super fitted throughout the waist as others have mentioned, but the length was just right and the arms/chest fit perfectly. for reference, i'm 5'2"", 100 lbs, 32b. this will look great with skinny pants or jeans.",5
I love this stylish sweater. i ordered black. it is very soft and comfortable. i wear it with snaps open or closed. looks great either way.,5
"I am 5'4"" so at the ""tall"" end of petit - and this is the perfect length. i haven't really done midi dresses before because i feel make me look stout. this is not the case. it hits mid-calf. the fabric is very thick, although for polyester i think it's kind of pricey. i'm going to keep it anyways, it doesn't look or feel cheap, and i think it will be good for travel because i don't think it wrinkles easily. the ribbon hits in a very flattering place right above the waist. i have a very athletic",5
"Love the collar, cut is cropped but i'm wearing a tank under for hole coverage anyways. no complaints!",5
"I bought this blouse in both the cream and the blue. both are lovely. i would say that the size runs a bit large, i bought size 12 and the bodice hangs away from my back, arms fit well though, loose fit. hangs well. the lace is nice and stiff. the cream has some cafe au lait shading on some of the lace so it could almost look stained. i don't think that will be how it reads, though, but fair warning.",5
"Love this sweater! it's really flattering, long and lean, though not tight, just the right amount of shape and length for my size. i run between and 8 and a 10, and i'm about 5'8"", i ordered the medium. i love the contrasting knits of the sleeves and body of the sweater. i only wish it came in more colors, i'd order it again!",5
So soft that i bought in 3 colors. i love wearing them. it is comfortable yet tailored. i highly recommend.,5
Retailer sleep pants are my favorite...the only sleep pants i will wear. fit is perfect. flowing shape and ultra-soft fabric feel like a little bit of luxury. first thing i put on when i get home from work!,5
"I grabbed this pair of pj pants on sale, and i'm glad i did. the material is soft and lightweight-- ideal for summer,. they fit loose but true to size for a standard pair of pj pants.",5
"I've been looking for a mid-weight, shrug-on cardigan for a while now and i've finally found the one! as a petite (5'4"", 130 lbs) lady with big boobs, i hate clingy cardigans with buttons since they are just so unflattering. 

luckily this cardigan is warm without being stifling, fitted in the sleeve without being impossible to wear over clothes with different-length sleeves, and perfectly cut to slim even thought it is shrug-y. i especially like the back details, which are even more curve-fla",5
"This dress is so flattering on, i was astounded. often the ""waistline"" in the petite dress are very high, even though i'm only 5'1"" tall, but this one hit at the right place and the skirt made me feel slim and tall. the fabric feels silky and the pattern is nice, but it is a pretty conservative style and perhaps a bit dark for spring. would be great for work, or church, but unfortunately doesn't really fit my lifestyle and i personally prefer a more unique style for the price. i highly recommend",5
"I bought the sweater in nude, and it fits perfectly. it is so much better than a standard cardigan- it has beautiful details. its drapes so well across your body, and it longer in the front than the back which makes it hang beautifully. i wear this to work, but would definitely wear this on the weekends for more casual outfits- its very versatile.",5
"I ordered this top in ivory in 2 sizes, because i'm in between and it looks so great in the photos and didn't want to risk it selling out while i debated sizing. i really loved the larger size because the material is not stretchy and i didn't want the sleeves to be tight when i move. it is somewhat boxy on the seam at the waist so i'm having it taken in a little so it fits more like a peplum and flares. adding a skinny belt just didn't distribute the excess fabric as i envisioned. it really is a",5
"Ok, so by now, we know this is a cute top that is basically true to size but a little clingy. i prefer to wear it with a tank top or tee shirt underneath. it would also do well layered under something. for refernce, i am 5'7, about 120, and xs was the best fit.

but what i really wanted to mention is that i washed it in the machine on cold delicate and dried it on low, and it survived just fine!",5
"So i love this top. i got it in black and red. both are amazing and go with about anything. they run a bit large. i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck. i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry. i would say it shrunk 10% at most. beyond that, no difference. in fact, it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big. obviously, if you do not dry clean this, you are going against manufacturer recommendations, but i",5
"I spotted this pj pants in the store, tried it on, and love it! the material is very soft and comfortable. the fabric is on the thin side, thus, one star off the quality. the pattern/color varies, the one i got has more pinkish flowers. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, and size s fits nice. i could probably go down to a size xs, but i like my pj pants to fit a bit roomy, therefore size s fits better. the length is more like ankle length on me since i am petite. it is very cute on and perfect for a chill summe",5
"I love this black turtleneck. arms are a little long, so should have gotten small. i wore it and love it! you can play with collar and snaps; up or down.",5
"I love this sweater, i bought the grey and the neutral one. it is very soft, has great color combos and seems to have minimal pulling. even though it's lightweight, it keeps me warm.",5
Just a lovely soft and easy cover piece. the back is so different and interesting.,5
"This polo shirt has just the perfect amount of feminine detail to make it a great addition to my wardrobe. i love the shorter version, and it looks great with both jeans or skirts.",5
"This is such a gorgeous and unique turtleneck from retailer. my favorite color is the nude and buttoned neck is really pretty. i'm 5'1 and 105 pounds and i got the small since i liked the longer length and did not want it too clingy. it is a personal preference but you may want to go up a size. as for the dry cleaning, i washed this on delicate cycle without dryer and it came out perfect. love this!",5
"Cool color, great feel to this sweater. nice with jeans, skirts, etc. very cozy to wear. i just want to keep grabbing it every morning.",5
I have two of these tops. the maroon and tan and white stripe. the material is great and the neckline lays great. it isn't too thick so i can wear it on cooler florida days. you can dress it up under a jacket or dress down with some jeans.,5
"I got this in the red. it is a muted color that is very pretty. i am 5'5"", and it is neither too long nor too short. it is a nice, light weight. the quality is good and on par with other purchases from this brand.",5
Great spin on a basic turtleneck! i like it unbuttoned just as must as buttoned! material is super soft. good length.,5
"I love this top. i ordered it in a large thinking it would be a tight rib but it is not so i reordered it in a small. i am 5'7"" 145lbs 34g chest. the small fits perfectly and probably could have taken an xs. it is stretchy but fits wonderfully. i bought the black. i love how the neck snaps and adds a little pizzazz to a simple black turtle neck. i'm wearing it today with straight leg jeans and my leopard print ballet flats. i feel like audrey hepburn!! i will not be dry cleaning it. i will wash",5
"I absolutely adore this top! it is so versatile and looks equally beautiful with jeans as with dressier, skinny pants. i bought this to wear for our holiday photos and have gotten so much use out of it. worth every penny. i have just ordered the blue version and cannot wait to get it.",5
"I am in love with this dress and can't wait to wear it to brunch this weekend! i am normally a ps, but they only had the pxs which i took a chance on. fits like a glove. slightly tight in the chest area, but i am chesty for a petite girl. the length is perfect and modest, the detail up front is adorable.",5
"What a find! this skirt is so soft and fits like a dream. perfect shape and length. i've been looking for more pieces to match a couple of fabulous pairs of purple shoes i have, so this is just the ticket!",5
"I love these jeans so much i have 4 pairs. i bought pink and gray last year and then black and denim this year. i am 5'4"" 112 lbs. with a slim, straight, athletic build. these jeans look amazing on; they don't have those funny crease rolls in the legs because the legs weren't cut right, i don't have to tug on the waist to get them to stay up and they are just very flattering on. sometimes when i try on skinny jeans, they fit funny around the waistband and make my hips look weird. not these, i ju",5
"This is the first one piece swimsuit i've owned since i was a toddler. i'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs 34b bust with short torso and athletic built legs...so i wasn't sure how this would fit. was i ever surprised!! i bought the size small in the mint chevron pattern. the material is substantial but not overly thick. it is double layered and the cups are padded for extra coverage. it was a little tight to pull on but after having it on it conformed to my curves like it was cut to fit them. the top offers an",5
"I noticed this vest hanging in my local store and tried it on on a whim because it felt so soft. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer's clothing so i tried on the xs/s and felt it was true to size - it's obviously large, but that's because that is the style! the shoulders fell perfectly. i was in love from the moment i put it on! while it's not my normal style, it was so soft and beautiful and it flowed perfectly, plus the extra fabric allowed for a bit of ""cozying up"" in colder weather by wrappi",5
"This dress is beautiful! it is a nice, heavy fabric with stretch and just fits perfectly.",5
"I bought these on sale and they quickly went back. i was very disappointed after reading the reviews. i thought for sure these would be a winner. however, i was sadly mistaken. i ordered another pair of jeans, the same, from a different brand. these were way too small while my others were too large. they didn't live up to my expectation and were still rather long. even though i bought these on sale, i was not happy with the quality.",1
"This ia a long boiled wool vest with some spandex in it. it is very soft and cozy. i went with the m/l cause i preferred the longer length, even though i also fit in the xs/s. 
i have worn it many times, and my favorite way to wear it is with skinny jeans tucked into cowboy boots paired with a black lace top and a cool necklace. when i am hanging out at home in yoga pants and slippers, i throw it on when i get cold-its like a cozy hug. i highly recommend!",5
"These run a tiny bit large, but i'm still keeping them. they are so soft and comfortable!",5
"I love these jeans- they really added something special to my wardrobe!

size: 
i purchased my normal size in the store and was worried they wouldn't stretch out. the sales clerk helping me order the larger size alerted me that these will stretch a full size as i wear them but i wanted to be sure so i ordered the larger size just in case. 

i received the larger size and when i tried them on i could feel them stretching out right away and feeling too loose. i kept my normal size and wore th",5
"Totally love this shirt as a basic with fun details. super soft great quality fabric, and the cutouts add the perfect bit of interest. can see this accessorizing well and looking good with jeans or skirts. really happy with it. fits loose, but tts.",5
Perfect way to add warmth in transition weather,5
"Really love this bathing suit. it fits very well, definitely don't need to size up for this one. flattering to my mom-bod and breasts that have seen perkier days. excited to be taking this one to costa rica with me this summer!",5
"Great jeans!!! i'm over 60 & it's difficult finding jeans. these fit like a glove, with just enough stretch & the twisted hem adds a bit of unexpected style. i liked them so much, i ordered another pair!",5
"I stumbled upon this vest in my local store and i'm so happy i did. i was looking for a classic staple that will be on trend but pass into classic season after season. i wore this with a black 3/4 sleeve top, dark skinny jeans and black booties....perfect look for most seasons in dallas. so happy about this purchase!",5
"I love the fit of this sweater. i recently had a baby and am a little self-conscious of my stomach area. the sweater, in my usual size s, hides my problem area without being big and boxy. the weave seems like it will be prone to snags, so i'll have to be careful.",5
Fit great and cute. cannot wait for summer to wear with sandals.,5
"I bought a similar shirt from this same manufacturer in blue and i've returned for another. i love it because you can layer it. you can wear this over a colored shirt and the color will show through the designs in the yoke. it looks great with bright colors. yes, it wrinkles easily but i am hoping that it will wrinkle less each time it is washed.",5
"Although i loved it i feel like its too hip for me! love the material, style, just doesn't look right on me!",5
"I purchased this swimsuit in the mint. gorgeous color combination. i'm 5'5"" and weigh 117 lbs. i purchased a small. the fit is true to size. i love the front design; however, my husband promptly brought the back of the swimsuit to my attention. the chevron was off center. the design should have been centered with my back; however, it was on the right side of my back. i immediately called retailer assuming the product was defective. the item was sold out on line; however, a supervisor was able to l",1
This caught my eye straight away and it hasn't disappointed on either. really unique and i imagine it will suit many different occasions. high quality and slimming vertical stripes too.,5
These pants are very soft and comfortable.  great for lounging around the house and for sleeping.,5
"I love these pants so much, i have them in two colors. they are super comfy, light and actually really chic. perfect cool girl pants. i have got so many compliments. my young students (4-5) love my ""ninja pants""! i got them on sale. great, great buy. i highly recommend them.",5
"These pants fit comfortably and are really nice on! they're not too bulky and can be worn in a casual way and/or with a formal look. i just wish black jeans didn't always have that odd rubber smell. other than that, these are great!",5
"These jeans immediately caught my eye online, and when i saw them in the store on display, i knew i had to at least try them on. they are absolutely adorable. i love the uniqueness of the buttons at the bottom. great fit, and great stretch. i wore them for the first time today, and i had at least four people i didn't know approach me and tell me that they liked my jeans.",5
Ordered my regular size s early this week and was thrilled to receive them yesterday. they fit just as expected and are quite comfortable. i would definitely recommend them as a nice alternative to pajamas or even as a slip.,5
"Did not even know this is available in petite! as someone who is at 5' exaggerated, there regular size xs/s fits nicely. great find. goes well with leggings or jeans. this will be a wardrobe staple for quite a while.",5
"I cannot begin to tell you how much i love these jeans. i have been searching everywhere for the right pair of black jeans, and this is it. they run a little small and don't have as much give as regular pilcro jeans: i am normally a 28 in pilcro and i purchased these in a 29. the fit is wonderful and they keep their shape beautifully.",5
Absolutely wonderful! they fit like a dream. you could dress them up or down. i'll probably live in these jeans forever.,5
"I was intrigued by this vest on-line but really wanted to try it on first before i purchased it. stopped into my local retailer store today and was happy to see they had it in stock. i am typically a 10/12 and purchased this in the m/l. this picture does not give the vest justice in terms of the way it falls, which to me is what makes a vest a success or not. also, the colors are great. i was wearing a cream sweater and black pants when i tried it on, went great with those colors but i think it wi",5
"I love these shorts, the subtle floral pattern is even prettier in person. the drawstring waist allows me to customize the fit for my newly pregnant belly.",5
"I have to disagree with some previous reviews -- i think the buttons on these ankle jeans really set them apart. they look absolutely adorable with booties, flats, wedges, heels, anything! and they're extremely comfortable and flattering, as most pilcros tend to be. i got my usual size 26 and the rise and fit is great. i think maybe they stretch out a bit; i've only worn them a couple times and by the end of the day the waist seems a little loose. but overall, great and a good price (at least co",5
I have never tried this brand before and was pleasantly surprised at the fit! i especially like the button detail as it makes them a little more dressy and different. i plan to wear with a simple white tank and sandals. i will definitely look for this brand again!,5
"These are fabulous pants.  they can easily  be worn to work.  best jeans/pants ever for women with no butts!!  they stay up, and they're comfortable. 
i can't  speak highly enough for these.  don't  ever stop  making them, retailer!!",5
I have this in another color and it is my absolute fav! transform any outfit! it has an over-sized fit.,5
"Great fit. love the mid rise! my usual size 28 in these leggings hug in all the right places. they look on me as in the model pic except the length falls abt 1"" below my ankles. i may have them hemmed after they're washed. just wait & see... 5'3"" 117#",5
"I love this suit! the fit is incredible. 

i'm unsure that the fabric will stand the test of time, but i got it on sale, and i don't know about you ladies but ill do anything for a great suit!",5
I actually love these jeans. i feel they run true to size. i actually love the button detailing at the bottom. makes them unique and different from the other jeans in my closet. i can wear them dressed up with heels or wear with sandals.,5
I love pilcro's jeans. they fit adults without being mom jeans. the quality is great. the legging cut is simple with just the right amount of stretch. they're a tiny bit short but i like to show a little skin in booties.,5
"I really love this shirt. the cutouts make it unique and the fabric is super soft for a chambray style. i thought the fit was perfect - i'm 5'5"", 120lbs and i ordered an xs. still enough room to be comfortable. super cute! glad i bought it.",5
"These jeans were a pleasant surprise. they are comfy, stretchy and fit right at the ankle. i have skinny legs and i love that these are a slim fit .i am normally a 27 waist but the 26 had a better fit. the dark demin and the gold buttons give it a dressy look. they also give my derriere a nice shape. i am 5?2?, 116 lbs and i have slim hips. to top it off, the jeans were an additonal 30% off the sale price!",5
"I love the look of peplum tops, i think they are very forgiving, and they do a fantastic job of hiding my residual baby weight while still allowing me to look like i have an amazing figure (not washed out figure). i have several peplum tops, but most of them are made out of a thicker fabric and they don't have much movability. i absolutely love this one because it is a more casual design and much more comfortable than i am used to while still keeping the integrity of the peplum design. the fabri",5
I am 5 6' and 130 pounds and ordered this in an xs. the sweater is enormous. the material is also scratchy and not soft at all. i'm disappointed with retailer's sizing this year. i've had to return a # of xs items because they are huge. really disappointing.,1
"I agree with the other reviewer, the picture does not do this jacket any justice at all. the material drapes beautifully and is easily cinched or opened up for slightly different looks. i kind of consider it more of a cardigan than a jacket and plan on wearing it over everything. i tried it on over workout gear and it looked great than wore it over jeans and a chunky sweater and it looked awesome. very versatile and flattering.",5
"Agree with the others. when i saw this jacket in the store i really liked it, and when i tried it on i had to have it! it looks great, drapes beautifully and the color goes with so many things. my first instinct was to size up to a medium to maximize the drape, but it wasn't necessary. runs a tad on the large side.",5
"Love the contrast of fabrics, thick and thin. comfy like a favorite sweatshirt but with style. can be worn both, on a night out or curled up on the sofa watching a movie at home.",5
"Non-stop compliments! i wear this with dresses at the office, and denim on the weekends- super versatile.  this is one of those pieces that you keep forever.",5
These pants have a very odd design but they are so soft and so comfortable i could not resist. going on a trip to key west and thought they would be great for the plane ride. they fit true to size. could not pass up as they were on sale.,5
"I would have never purchased this jacket based on the photo displayed here. it looks like something my grandma would wear. in person, however, this jacket is so versatile. the fabric moves with your body,and the ties at the bottom in the back and inside at the waist can be cinched to give it the look you want. i purchased this to wear with the weekend widelegs (which i also adore), and it's absolutely perfect. color goes with everything. i'll wear it with boyfriend jeans in the fall, too. great",5
"I love, love this trench! i bought the grey, and it goes well with so many other pieces! i can dress it up for work or wear it out for brunch on the weekend. it's a great layering piece for the san francisco weather i'm adjusting to!

it does run a little big, but i don't mind because it gives enough room for layering. i'm short at 5'3 but still stuck with a small-- a small petite probably would look great as well!

hei hei consistently makes great jackets/trenches :)",5
"I wanted this dress so much, i ordered it twice. both times the zipper was defective--it would get stuck midway up, at the waistline--so i had to send it back (there isn't an retailer in my area). this is a shame because it's got great colors and looks flattering on, and i was looking forward to pairing it with a cardigan/boots for fall. i even thought about taking it to a seamstress to have the zipper replaced, but the cost didn't seem worth it. too bad, as it seems like it would be a nice",1
"This top is so pretty. i would say it's probably  about 1 size smaller than normal, but i like the cropped fit.",5
"Love this top, just received it today.
it is a very artistic interpretation for a casual top.
the blue is gorgeous!
the unique style of the peplm and the details on the front set this apart!
runs a little shorter, but i feel the length enhances it;s beauty, and is appropriate for the overall design.
love !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ordered my usual size and it fits perfectly.",5
"This is such a gorgeous shade of indigo! i was instantly attracted to it! upon trying on, i was surprised at how soft the fabric was. definitely a cozy sweatshirt feel in disguise! i love the peplum detailing and found the xs to be just right in length to my hip and everywhere else! i can't wait for it to cool off here in new england so i can wear this beautiful top!! i anticipate many compliments on s lovely top!!",5
I absolutely love this jacket! i wear it almost everyday. works as a cardigan or a jacket. my favorite retailer purchase so far:),5
Wow this is a keeper. love how soft and special the color feels. the knit for back and arms makes it very comfy and easy to wear. not really easy to layer it since arms pretty fitted. love it with jeans since the back ends at waist.,5
"This top has the thickness and comfort of a sweatshirt, with artistic flair and a figure flattering, unique cut. it works very well on me as i'm a petite large. i only wish it was a little roomier, or that i was 10 lbs lighter, but it's stretchy and i really love wearing it. the color is a rich indigo with a slightly worn look which adds texture and dimension.",5
"I fell in love with this top when i first saw it in the store, and bought it during the 25% off sale. i'm petite, 32dd, usually a size 4. i tried the xs and s and while both fit, i like the roominess of the s so i got that size. i bought the regular size for a little extra length, but could have worn the petite. it's great for layering because of all the bright colors, and although the front is polyester, the back is knit so it's nice and cool. i personally love loose-fitting, shorter tops, so i",5
This dress is absolutely darling! it is light as a feather and floats on the body. the fabric looks almost handpainted and fits like a dream. i disagree with the previous poster and i think it looks very rich. super comfortable and i know i'll get lots of wear out of it. you can dress it up or dress it down. love it!,5
"Beautiful fabric with soft drape. unfortunately the ""captain kangaroo"" pockets are awful. unless you have a straight up and down shape with no hips this is very unflattering. the pockets look like saddle bags and add a huge amount of fabric where most people don't want added bulk. very disappointing. returned.",1
"I love this cardigan. it's quite luxurious and roomy and long in the front, leaving lots to wrap around yourself. the back is more cropped
and slim fitting to help balance. this is so soft and warm, i love it. definitely bulky and cozy, not fitted. but perfect for a casual look. i'm usually a medium in sweaters but got a small in this, and it's still a little loose which is perfect.",5
"This top is very cute, very flattering, and very unique! love the high/low back! also very comfy, would recommend to anyone!",5
"Soft, pretty design and perfect length. i'm 5'6"" and the m fit perfectly!'",5
I could seriously sleep in this--it's that soft! i dressed this with a white tee and holey jeans then i wore it to work today over a blue midi dress. love this jacket!!!,5
"This is a very stylish and unique trench. it does run a bit large as i am usually a medium in jackets, but needed a small for this one. i am 5'2"" , 120 lbs., but with a large chest. i think it's very flattering. i have small hips, but the large pockets do not make me look bigger. it arrived very wrinkled, but i just touched it up with an iron. i think the color is more of a taupe-gray and will go with everything. love it!",5
I tried this on at my local store and immediately had to buy it. the picture does not do it justice. it drapes wonderfully in front and sticks out a bit at the pockets to give some added personality. fabric is very soft and light weight. highly recommend!,5
"As other reviewers have pointed out, this jacket is way prettier in person than it is in the photos. i can wear it with just about anything. the fabric is soft and lightweight, and drapes really nicely. my only complaint is the photos make the taupe jacket look like it has just a hint of peach/mauve, but in person it's a pretty standard beige. i would have liked that hint of color.",5
"These are the cutest pants ever. they are super soft and a nice lightweight material for spring/summer. sadly, i have to return them because they are huge. i generally wear an xs in retailer, and these literally fall off my waist and look like clown pants. i wish they made an xxs. if you size down at least one size, they are adorable!",5
"Absolutely love this jacket.initially wanted to buy the melita draped jacket, which looks similar to this one, and tried them both on in store. the latter just didn't drape properly and looked more like a bathrobe on me, but this piece is amazing! it falls nicely and the pockets jut out a bit giving it a unique look. the fabric is fluid and soft and it has a tie waist with another tie in the back of the jacket,middle bottom, which is a bit of an added but subtle flair, the color is a bit more 't",5
I disagree with the fit description from the other reviews. i find the shirt to be super flattering and comfy. yes it it short in comparison to many styles these days. but it hits right at the waistline without being too short. super vibrant colors.,5
"I do not understand all the great reviews but that goes to show everyone likes different things! the jacket looks great in the pictures but in person, it just looks awful! gray is one of my favorite colors but this color is so drab and the material looks old and worn. it definitely has a grunge look to it and overall, it is just a wrinkly mess. another reviewer said it looks like old clothes and i have to agree. it looks very shabby. it also reminds me of those smocks they have at the hair salon",1
"I do not understand how a couple people gave this a bad review. i loved this jacket from the minute i tried it on. cute in the picture and cuter on, because it is so comfortable. the fabric is super soft and does not wrinkle (as one reviewer stated). i took it on the plane with me just to keep warm and it was fabulous. looked as good going on the plane as it did coming off. the drape of the jacket flows nicely and i love the oversized pockets to stash my phone or lipstick. this jacket will carry",5
This was a nice surprise because it's a thick sweatshirt type of fabric. don't be deterred! it is nothing like a sweatshirt. it's comfy like a sweatshirt though. i'm 5 feet tall 120 pounds. i ordered my usual size petite small and it fit perfectly. what little height i have is in my torso. i didn't find that the top was short at all. it's without a doubt tts. order your usual size. if you have a tummy or bootie this top is the ticket! the description on the fabric details that the other reviews,5
No only is this a beautiful update to a basic white top it is incredibly soft. i couldn't pass it up and wish it came in more colors!,5
Love this & so cute to have t-shirt with additional details. usually get medium size in blouses but liked the fit of the large better.,5
"Really love this blouse for several reasons....it fits! pretty true to size depending on how fitted you want it. not too much of a difference between a 6 or 8. it is a bit sheer but i am not worried about it. now my favorite part is the tie in the middle.....finally not a boxy waist, it's up to you to pull it in or loosen. the length is perfect...not too long so it works over skirts too. it is soft. my only concern is how long will it last. will require careful washing and ironing. may end up pu",5
"I went into retailer looking for a specific dress and had to try this on when i saw how lovely it looked displayed at the store. it is a beautiful dress. not see through at all. substantial weight, not to heavy and so very beautiful. i stayed tts on it . i would have purchased it but was buying 3 other dresses.. i may go back as it will be perfect for the hot summer days.",5
I was so impressed with the quality of this top that i bought it in all the colors.. it is comfy and thin. i purchased my usual size . it is so adorable with the lattice stripe..,5
"I love this top. i got the blue, the colors are deep and just beautiful
i'm normally a large, so i feel this top runs large. i got the medium and it fits perfect 
it is long, i'm 5'6"" and it hits the bottom of my butt. 
you won't be disappointed, try this top",5
"I love this shirt. great mix of chic, comfortable and feminine! can wear for many occasions!",5
"I just bought this dress as it went on sale recently. i read all the other reviews - and, imho, the dress is ivory not yellow as another reviewer suggested. i am only 5'2"" and weigh 115llbs - there were no petite sizes available so i bought a size 2 which is a bit long, but that's ok. the arm holes weren't too small and the neckline is large enough to slip over my head. the dress is very much a swing dress...i wish there was just a little less dress...it really is too voluminous for my taste. i",5
Very happy with this top! love the design--very different. also like that the front panel is different fabric. buttons also are a fun detail. great shirt to transition from summer to fall. i usually wear xs or s--ordered this in xs and perfect fit. going to be a favorite.,5
"I am writing a review even though this is currently sold out (and was just released). what i love: the fit: snug, not too tight, and xs is true to size in the sense of historically. the wasit is cinched in, ample room in the chest. the fabric is substantial (thick and sturdy) and not prone to wrinkle, based on me having it in the bag in the hot car) and no false pleats was created. the sleeves are fun and different, may be a bit much for some. it is in multiple pieces, why it flutters so nicely.",5
"This fits me more like a tunic so i wear it with jeggings. i am 5'4 and usually a 10-12 petite and the s fit well.
the arms are stretchy which i like since i have an athletic build. love the butterfly pattern !",5
"I had to go up one size, but i love this blouse! dressy enough for work, and you can make it casual with jeans. tight across the chest, but the next size up fit perfect!",5
Love this tee. it has a drapery cut which i love. the only thing i found was that it ran a bit smaller.,5
I love this dress! it is super cute and swingy. a perfect summer dress - dress it up or even for a fun summer afternoon with sandals. the fit is great (the armholes on the regular 0 were a little big. the 0petite is much better),5
The shirt is a little roomy but so flattering. the design with little see through holes across the shirt are unusual and make it unique.,5
"This is such a fun dress to pull out during the summer. it is beautiful and i receive numerous compliments whenever i wear it. also, it is pretty lightweight, so it stays cool.",5
"I purchased the tan ""ish"" gray colored one in xs. it looks a bit mauve in the pictures, but is still very beautiful.. i like the drape of the fabric and the cats on the front. the one drawback is that the arms are very snug, especially the upper arm and chest. i have not worn it yet and am debating whether or not to exchange for the next size up. just have to get to my area retailer before they sell out of the size small.",5
This is longer than i thought it would be- but again i'm petite! i ordered the grey and it's more of a grey green color that is absolutely beautiful. it is such a cute and easy top to wear!,5
This shirt is so cute with the cutout stripes and it goes with everything. it's easy to wear and true to size. you can dress it up or dress it down. the fabric is soft but also light weight. i am so happy to own this classic piece.,5
"I love this blouse. it is perfect for a curvy figure. i think it runs true to size. maybe size up if you have a larger chest. i love how it is so feminine yet structured. the fabric is lovely, soft and structured all at once. love the knot, i tried it with the stevie ankle jean and couldn't leave the store without it. it is pricey but sometimes its okay to pay $$$ for a perfect fit!",5
"I was really excited for this jacket to arrive but it's going back. because the fabric is coated, it does not drape or hang nicely at all. i expected it to be boxy but it sticks out so oddly in every direction that it looks horrible. i'm usually an xs and ordered an xs and it looks ridiculous on me.",1
"I love this top! the arms fit slender but the rest of the top is a nice loose fit. i love the navy blue one with the print, i normally don&#39;t like long tunics but it&#39;s so flattering even for my short frame! i&#39;m usually a medium on top and bought the medium which was perfect.",5
"The detail and overall quality of the fabric is incredible. i normally avoid swing dresses, but this is a flattering dress. i typically wear between sizes 2-6 (depending on designer) and a 6 fit me perfectly. i'm extremely happy that i purchased it and received compliments as soon as i wore it out. i'm also tall, so i have to be concerned with length of dresses and this falls perfectly right at the top of the knee.",5
The embroidery across the top is quite lovely. the softness and light weighted fabric was ideal for the summer months. making this purchase on sale was such a bonus!,5
This is absolutely beautiful. the picture online doesn't do it justice. i slipped this on with skinny jeans in the store and was hooked instantly. fit was a little large. i would have tried a petite but this shirt doesn't come in petite sizes. love this!,5
"I tried this top on in the store before i ordered it online. i'm a size 2/4 (varies), and i ordered it in a size 2. i've been searching the perfect, fitted, white, button-down blouse for weeks, and i love this top! it's figure flattering, true to size, and a cute, classy alternative to your basic white button down. i can't wait to wear it! =]",5
"I've been looking for a great white blouse for awhile, and this is it! the tie waist is especially flattering for hourglass figures, but i'm sure it would add some curves to any body type. the fabric is soft, not crisp, and drapes beautifully. you definitely will be doing some ironing, though. it's a bit sheer, but i always wear nude bras and felt no need for a cami. i did buy the regular, rather than petite sizing and usually wear a 0 or 2, but had to size up to a 4 regular to avoid gaping in f",5
"I ran into retailer to actually return a dress and saw this hanging in the petite section and had to try it. at almost 5'4"" i can sometimes go between regular and petite sizing. and thankfully i could grab the petite with this dress. (they didn't have the regular size) it's airy and summery, i love the design of the swing. it's loose, but not tent like. the length came to about 3 inches above my knee. it's not see though at all! i had black bottoms on and you couldn't see them. another plus it tha",5
"I've had this jacket for a few weeks and it has been a terrific transition piece for the spring. this is a lightweight layering piece without any lining. it works well as a topper for cooler morning temps and you can still wear it later in the day without perspiring through it. i bought it in the olive color, which works with just about everything and the xs was tts (for reference-5'4,116 lbs.). the fit is slightly boxy with a nice swing and drape in the back. for those concerned about the back",5
"I loved the print on both, but first bought the blue to check out the fit and feel. i went ahead and ordered the cat one today. the fit is relaxed and slightly oversized so if you want a slimmer or less boxy fit, size down. for myself, m was perfect since i'm built larger and broader on top. the top is a bit long, covers my hips and some of my bottom. it's a mixed fabric design, so the linen part may feel scratchy to sensitive types.",5
"The label says 100% linen, but it's so silky and drapey that it feels like silk and linen. it's not a scratchy linen at all. it's a very very fine knit, but the top is not sheer. i do not think you need a cami under it. 

i bought the xl and the fit is just as shown. it has a slight drape, but it's not really baggy at all. i bought the grey and it looks lighter on-line that it really is. it's a bit darker and has a silver essence also. i liked this so much, i just bought another one in mauve.",5
This is a fantastic top to wear with the paige high wasted flair jeans. love it,5
"I wasn't sure about this top online. in the picture, it sort of looks like it juts out after the tie. but the reviews said it was really soft and flattering on. i wasn't sure exactly how the sizing translated (numbers vs letters), so i ventured into the store. i am normally either an xxs or xs in most retailer tops. i went with size 2. i think i would have been ok in the 0, but it might have gotten a bit snug in the shoulder area sizing down. and with the front tie, it can be cinched in to create",5
This top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric. the photo really doesn't do it justice. i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants. it's a stunner!,5
"The petites fit perfect!!  these are so comfortable, i will get much us out of them!",5
Just as beautiful as in the picture. it is warm and the best part is that it is not itchy! love it and cannot wait to wear it as the weather changes.,5
"I'm 5'5"", 115 lbs, with a 25"" waist and 35"" hips. i purchased a 25 and the fit was perfect. i'm just a bit short waisted, have a rather small waist and often find that pants of any kind gap at the back. these fit perfectly, felt great on, and i love the fabric.",5
"Haven't worn it yet, but i am loving this top. it is much prettier in person. i sized up to a med based on reviews and it looks like it runs small. i didn't try it on until i got home and probably could have done ok in a small but will keep the medium so it's not tight across my chest. the knit material that makes up the arms and back is thin, which is my only complaint. if it was slightly thicker it would look nicer and i'm sure wear longer. i'm happy with my purchase-the colors, fabric, embroi",5
"Loved my. mustard colored ones so much, i also bought the ligher green color. fit is wonderful- and very flattering. they can be dressed up or down. they look great with heals or booties!",5
"I'm a 5'7""and curvy, these pants fit well and are so comfortable. i think everyone should own at least one pair!",5
I am two months postpartum and bought this top to have something to wear for a date night. it is so flattering and has a beautiful cut. loose but not baggy or unflattering. i bought a small but could have probably sized down... so there's a decent amount of wiggle room in the sizing. great length for jeans or leggings.,5
"I ordered in this in the kelly green and loved it so much i wore it the very next day after it came in the mail. the green color is gorgeous and easily complements so many other colors in my wardrobe. the cardigan itself is super comfy and i love the full length long-sleeves! so many cardigans these days come with 3/4 length sleeves, which are fine, but sometimes you want a long sleeve. the fit almost runs on the larger side, but i think that a slightly looser look works well for this cardigan,",5
"This one is way better in person. admittedly, i put it in my basket only becasue it was on the stylists picks...well, it is great. a little sheer, adn super static-y when i received it, but oh so soft. the plunge is a tiny bit low for my liking, but this doe'n'tt come in petites,so i had to suck it up and keep the regular sie. teh coloring is nice too, neutral, event htough there is rust and navy and greay-ish, it stil lcan be worn with anything..",5
"I read the cleaning instructions label carefully. followed them closely. and still, the dye ran and stained some of my colored clothes. pi**ed me off! just after the first wash and even before wearing them, i have streaks of uneven color on the pants. bad quality material or dye is what causes this. now i have to go and see if i can even get out my other stained clothes. thanks a lot retailer.",1
"I bought this cardigan in grey. it's sturdy, soft, great layering sweater over a top or even under a heavier sweater. the tail in back is long and unique. the shape is flattering. and for a lighter cardigan, it's more substantial than others out there. the sleeves are long enough for my long arms, which i love.",5
I love this sweatshirt! new favorite! it has a comfy meant to be oversized fit... love the little inspirational quote... and it's the kind of sweatshirt you want to live in! so stinking soft! got lots of compliments at the gym and the pick up line at school!!!,5
"This top is lovely! exquisite embroidery in a silvery-beige color compliments the deep plum. the fit is close to highlight your curves, while being just a touch comfy. very chic for a jazzed up outfit for a night out with jeans or black pants and your best booties. i wear a size 8 normally and the medium fits me perfectly. my body type is curvy and athletic.",5
"This top is beautifully made, but comfortable. the neckline is a stretch fabric and the cut is very flattering. the length is just short enough that it doesn't look like a dress.",5
"Beautiful design and soft, warm wool. warm enough to have on outside in the fall (i live in pdx), and also stylish enough to keep on inside. buy the right size (not too big) because it's meant to fit on the waist and the skirt swings out from there!",5
Very comfortable. im 5'2 so i ordered the petite and its a perfect length. no need to roll up. slightly slim fit but not overly tight. typically order everything online and didn't need to return. ordered charcoal color which is simply a faded black/dark grey.,5
"I'm a little on the short side, i was afraid it was going to be too long in the back. the sweater is perfect all the way around. i like the looseness in the front and like the way it lays in the back. the color is great.",5
So glad i purchased this tunic! just lovely. can see myself reaching for it constantly this summer. necklace friendly too!,5
"Great chinos, but they run a size large. i ordered my normal pants size and had to return them for one size down. i actually like them so much after finding the right size, i bought a second pair in store. i have the grey and mustard yellow. love them! just order a size down!",5
"Ordered the grey colored capris & they fit great. i am 5'5 110lbs and the size 25 fits me comfortably. i've recently been making a transition into more comfortable, looser style pants instead of skin tight jeans. these are great. still figure flattering, but comfortable and well made. the detail on the button section is lovely also.",5
"I am 5-9 1/2"" tall, 150 lbs, i bought the 8 in the honey color. they fit perfectly. there is some stretch and they are super soft! which for some reason is totally why i buy clothes. the length is good since they are capris. also, they did not have my size in store, so they had them shipped, for free, to my home. received them within 3 business days.

i would very much recommend them for a casual, fun look. the honey color will look great with navy, grey, and white for summer.",5
"Earlier this year i bought a pair of pilcro hyphen's as a birthday gift for a family member, and she absolutely loved them! after hearing from her how comfortable and amazing the pants are, i had to get some for myself! i usually only wear denim pants, everything else is skirts, dresses or shorts. so this was a big change in style for me.so far i love them, they are way more comfy than i had expected and made from great material!
i'm 5' 2'' and 120lbs. they 27s fit perfectly. i do not have slim",5
"Bought the pink color in the store and just loved the way that they fit me. i ended up ordering the light blue. perfect for a cool summer evening. can be worn with sandals, wedges, or converse sneakers!",5
"This is my third pair of these pants. they are my everyday staple, good for work or play",5
These pants are so great! they fit as expected and are a nice skinny crop but nothing too tight. the fabric is very soft making these pants incredibly comfortable. this was my first pair of the stet crops but will probably buy another pair in the future.,5
"This coat is a beauty. the embroidery is much prettier irl and the wool is not itchy at all. best of all is the tailoring, as i am very petite and i am so tired of all the shapeless, sack-like coats/jackets. it fits tts and has pockets. it is perfect, just wish retailer has more offerings like this.",5
"Thank you, retailer, for creating this sweetly vintage and feminine sweatercoat. the boiled wool is lovely and the embroidery makes me lightheaded just looking at it. this is definitely a nod to retailer's past, and i love it to bits! 
i usually wear a size s or xs, but bought this in the xs. the fit is flattering as can be. i was so happy to find a fitted and timeless piece in the sea of boxy and trendy sweaters.
(it's true that this sweater isn't lined, but to my mind, it would be a crime",5
"This shirt is more beautiful in person. it has a lovely hand feel (soft) and the blue is as shown but a bit more vibrant. i bought it for my 13 year old niece. she loved it! she may have to return for a small, but i do feel the size ran true to size. it depends on how you want to wear it.",5
"This top is so gorgeous! the color, the embroidery, the neckline, are all perfect. this can be worn casually with jeans or dressed up for a special occasion. i wore this to a thanksgiving part, but also to take final exams in (because it is comfy too!). this piece definitely runs small. i ordered a large despite being a medium in almost everything else at retailer and the fit is perfect.",5
"These are the same in sizing as the hyphen chinos, but these are far more versatile. i love the boyfriend look of the hyphens, but the stet chino can be dressed up or down. they are so comfortable and the fit is wonderful. i'm 5'8"" 138 lbs, and i took my usual size 28 in these. i have full thighs, and i didn't find these to be too tight in the legs at all, but i only tried on the black/charcoal.",5
"Absolutely adore this jacket. i'm typically a true medium at retailer and the medium fit perfect. the small actually fit really well to and had a little room for sweaters under it but i decided to stick with the medium just so i could bundle up if need be. so perfect and beautiful, the embroidery is gorgeous, i feel so feminine in this coat",5
I got the honey colored and love the color. they are very comfy and soft. i look forward to wearing them all summer,5
"I am a huge fan of cloth and stone tops as they are very versatile.
this particular one didn't disappoint. the combination of plaid and tie dye is so fun and fresh, yet the blue makes this piece an easy one to match with many bottoms.

now for the fit:
the cotton is very soft and lightweight.
i bought my normal size medium and it fits perfectly.

i look forward to wearing this piece often.",5
"I bought 2 pair of these in the store and ordered another color at the same time! these chinos are great for my figure. i like to think of myself as a ""diamond"" shape ;) large chest, moderate waist, large hips, and small legs. these pants fit so great!!! i bought my regular size and don't have to take in the legs! the fabric is nice with the additional stretch so we women who aren't 20 or 30-something any longer can still feel great and look good without being dumpy! i'm not a teeny woman either",5
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.

2. i love the hyphen chinos, and these fit almost the same, just a bit trimmer. they are not tight, and just skim my body perfectly.

3. i love all the colors. the red is darker than the two hyphen pinks.

4. the pants are comfy enough to be really casual and dressy enough to wear to work.",5
"I absolutely love these capris. after reading the reviews, i thought that they may fit a bit snug through the thigh, but they fit perfectly. i am roughly a size six (depending on the design, i can sometimes squeeze into a 4). i bought the size 27 in these and its perfect. also, i thought that the green would be more of a mint, but its definitely a more of a mossy color. i love that they are so versatile and literally go with everything! will be getting more colors in the future! great buy!",5
"This is classic retailer at it's best.  quality   style   a little something extra makes this piece something that will likely live in my fall / winter wardrobe for decades to come.  first the quality is superb, soft gray wool with a delicate floral embroidery motif on the front. military buttons down the front with a fit and flare waist on a 3/4 length coat.  versatile enough to wear as a sweater or light coat for early fall. fit is generous enough to easily fit a bulky sweater underneath and lay",5
"Cute, comfy, and would highly recommend them to others. i plan on getting one more color because i feel like i will wear them all the time!",5
"Love the fabric on this. so many retailer tops sit unworn in my closet because they are sheer and i have to wear a layer underneath. this will not be one of those. the fabric is beautifully embroidered and thick enough that it doesn't feel too delicate. the back is a super soft jersey....feel wonderful! will go nicely with jeans & flats for me! as a super bonus, i bought it with my birthday discount and now have in in time for a downton abby party. :) i'll be so pretty!",5
"The perfect summer pants. i will be ordering more colors and possibly a smaller size. i think the slim fit would look just as good in a less slouchy size. i bought a size 31 petite in the dark blue (not navy) and they fit perfect and the color is amazing. very high quality, feel very soft and comfy. for reference, i'm curvy, 5'2"", 146 lbs, usual size is a 31 (10-12) but i've recently been losing weight so my sizing may be off. the pants do stretch out like most pilcro chinos.",5
Very cute and great fit. i removed the belt (it's removable) for a different look.,5
"I fell in love with this top when i first saw it on the retailer website and was pleasantly surprised when it was every bit as beautiful in person as it was online (even more so). the bronze colored threads are to die for and the fit is perfect on my 5'4"" (129 lb) 34c frame. if your on the fence on this one, get it. it's worth the purchase!",5
"I love these bottoms. great colors. i also love the feel of the bottoms, very soft. high quality.",5
"Beautifully constructed and designed, this lovely sweater coat from rosie neira makes me anticipate fall weather more than i should. the fit is perfect for light layering and has a feminine silhouette. the wool feels like all my other boiled wool pieces--it's soft, slightly itchy, but tolerable. i wear a layer anyway so i hardly notice. just be aware for those that are extra sensitive. i purchased size mp and my stats are 5'3"" 135# 38/28/35",5
"I'm not much of a chino girl, but these fit like a favorite pair of jeans and with heels still look really polished. love them!",5
Soft. fitted without being tight. flattering neckline. nice embroidery.,5
"I'm so pleased with this cropped chino with all its lovely colors. i have bought 3 colors so far and i love the fit and comfort of these. i'm 5""1, 104 pounds and took the 24p since this runs a size large. my favorite is the lovely moss color which really a brighter mint green and i also love the honey color for spring and summer. these fit slightly slim yet still feel relaxed. love them and highly recommend these!",5
I took a chance and ordered extra one for my daughter-without ever running it by her first. i'd first seen the sweater in the store when another customer was tracking it down. it looked so nice and unique i couldn't forget about it even though i didn't try it on at the time. very happy i got it on sale-and so i got two-luckily we go to our different workplaces in different towns!,5
"Just got these mara hoffman classic bikini bottoms in flight azure print.today and love them: high quality, fully lined and reversible. the pattern placement is perfectly symmetrical and the colors are just like the online photos.
.
i think the size chart on the mara hoffman site is correct for where the bottoms sit on my body, above the widest part. i have a a-shape with smaller waist and hips, full behind and thighs (currently 33-25-37ish, 38"" at the widest which is at my thighs). in these t",5
This top is one of my retailer faves! it is so comfortable and love the quality and design. i receive many compliments on this top. i usually wear an xs or s in retailer tops and the xs was a little tight in the arms. the dressing room attendant suggested ordering a petite small so i wouldn't lose the shape. so glad i did. it fits perfect! i even ordered when it was on sale!! the gray color is perfect! its not too thick or thin.,5
"Love the blue color, different than many blue tops i own. i thought it was going to be a thicker knit and perhaps more stiff, but it is soft and a lighter knit and it makes the shape once on much more flattering.",5
I ove the interesting details on this pullover. it is super cozy on and i love the arched hem and extra long cuffs. the crew neck is wide and comfortable but not so wide that you need another shirt underneath. great easy pullover with jeans or leggings.,5
Perfect fit for my size. it elongate my petite frame.,5
Great top that can be worn so many ways. i bought the top in gray because it is way more interesting in person. it has just a touch of sparkle in it and lots of texture. i have seen this top on several people and it seems to flatter lots of different body types.,5
"This top caught my eye in store because of the fabric texture and light gray color. i wasn't too sure i'd like the cut on the bottom, but the neckline was so lovely i thought i'd try it out. i went with a small which is my usual (if not extra small) and loved it as soon as i put it on. the shape is very flattering, even with my post baby figure. i definitely think that it's better in person than in the photos online. and the price seems very good for a lovely sweater that's both classic and mode",5
"This is by far one of my favorite dresses i have tried on in a long time. i am a 2-4, the small was tts and so flattering. i think this would be better for someone taller with a lean frame, though its not super tight and the material has a great weight to it, it isn't lined and could definitely show figure flaws. for me it skims my body elegantly and was very comfortable through the bust, waist and hip (34c/26/36). it fits me like the model in the image. the one down side is that it is pullover",5
"I purchased this top (i thought of it as a sweater) to wear for a chilly holiday in mn. it's super flattering and i think it would be on anyone! my 28 year old daughter saw it on me and claimed at a christmas present so i just ordered another. we have very different body types but the neckline made us both look very elegant and it is super comfortable. i haven't seen how it cleans, yet. we both got the lighter colored one...love!",5
"Immediately loved this when i saw it online and even more in person. i'm only 5'1' so i tried the petite sizing first but ended up buying the regular in an xs for the slightly longer length. the regular fit me like the model in length and i probably could have taken the xxs except the sleeves were too narrow in that size. i like that the cuffs are long so if you have to turn it up (like i do) it doesn't look weird. also, i found the fit flattering at the hips, following my hourglass shape withou",5
I love this top. it looks exactly like the picture except the sleeves are not full length; they are closer to 3/4 length. the color is vibrant and the material is light and comfortable.,5
"I was thinking this would be a straight up terry cloth athleisure top, but the subtle metallic thread woven into the cloud gray fabric elevates the style. really loved the top because of the cut and interesting hemline, but i adore it for the bit of sparkle.",5
One of the sales women was wearing this today. she looked amazing. then i tried on. i looked really great. the gray pattern is much more distinctive in person. it is comfy - 97% cotton. the unique hem adds punch. able to dress up or down. i'm a true size 6. small fits perfectly. medium was very loose and oversized. well constructed. feels more like a $98 ($78 retail) pullover. highly recommend.,5
I was interested in this sweater because i actually thought it was a tunic. the sweater is much shorter than i thought. i wish i could return it. i bought a size large which is my normal size.,1
My sister gave me this top for christmas and it's perfect. i find myself grabbing for it constantly. i'm usually an xsp and the xxs fits me perfectly. i wear it with leggings and jeans.,5
Beautiful choice...beautiful fit for my daughter's slim body,5
Really well made. beautiful. sadly it is very short. not a tunic at all.,1
"I absolutely love this dress! the fit is great and the elastic waist helps to show off your shape. it's great for the warmer fall weather we have in the south, but i can put tights with it when it gets colder. the dress is thin, but not sheer so there's no need for a liner. i'm 5'8, weigh 144lbs and ordered this dress in a size 10. i think i might have been able to wear an 8, but the 10 fit so well that i kept it.",5
"This top is the best summer top ever. looks great, washes great, packs great. i get compliments whenever i wear it. fit is true to size. goes with everything.",5
"It fits perfectly, slim but not clingy, and it has a beautiful pattern/texture to it. its surprisingly warm for how thin it is and its a great layering piece.",5
"This is a beautiful top! it fits like a glove, very flattering.& got lots of compliments.
i am 5'4"" and 125 lbs, i bought size medium. love it! worth the money:)",5
"Just bought this in navy and love the easy versatility of it! the other colors in the print (including some black) can be worn as is, with a cardi, denim jacket, leggings/tights and boots, etc. i found the fit to be somewhat loose in my usual size 4, particularly in the chest (i'm 34a), and length was long enough to not need leggings in spring/summer (at 5'7""). the neckline is cut somewhat low, but retains modesty in my opinion because of how narrow of a v it is (don't feel need for cami). very",5
"Beautiful. did not look like much on the hanger, but this is a beauty. give it a try!
i am 5'10; normally a size 6 and the small fits perfectly. it should be loose fitting, with a dropped, not so obvious flounce. the colors are subtle and it will go nicely with many lightweight summer pants and shorts!",5
I love this dress! purchased it in pink and then in the blue color. it's perfect for any occasion and is very comfortable. i feel like it fits true to size and was not to revealing in the front however if i was to wear this to work it would need a cami underneath. it is not lined as well. love this dress! buy it in every color!,5
This is a great throw on and go dress. it would work great with a sweater and tights or by itself in the hottest of weather. it looks a lot less awkward on than the picture online indicates.,5
"I saw this dress in the new arrivals in red, and it caught my attention, but not enough to order it (the pictures online for other colors didn't look that great). well, i saw the black in the store and decided to try it on as it looked like hte cut would be cute. it fit like a glove and i actually love the pattern. i ordred the peite to compare, and also the red to see in person... we shall see which is the winnrer!",5
Beautiful lightweight cardigan. the sheerness is really pretty. ordered one for my sister too!,5
"I love this dress. i am wearing it for thanksgiving! i bought the black because the red was sold out, but would definitely buy more colors. true to size. i'm 5'6"" 135 and bought the 6. only issue is i have to wear a slip underneath because it's not lined and a tiny bit low cut for me.",5
"I'm glad that i went with the other reviewers and sized down on this one. i bought this in a medium (usually wear a 10/12) and it fit perfectly. the colors and pattern are beautiful and will definitely look great with dark jeans/pants/shorts. the lace detail is just gorgeous! the bottom flows more loosely, but just enough to cover any midsection flaws and pairs nicely with dark skinny jeans.",5
"Well made garment. i love the colors, fabric and flounce at the bottom. the top is a little large on top with large armholes, but at least it will be cool on a hot summer day.",5
"I bought these shorts in my usual size small (4-6) 38"" around hips/butt. they are a little loose in the butt and hips but i like them that way, especially given the drapey fabric they're made out of. the print is gorgeous, especially at the waistband. you need a cropped top or you need to tuck in your shirt to show it off. the red is a true bright red but beautiful. the waistband has a functional drawstring. i suspect they will need careful washing and line drying. i would not put these in a dry",5
"I purchased this dress for my 31st birthday and i am so glad that i did! i saw it in my local retailer store and immediately had to try it on! it is very flattering because i am 5'0, usually a size 8 or 10 in dresses and it fit perfect! the material is light, definitely suggest delicate cycle and hang-drying, but it is nice because you can layer this dress with a vest or coat! highly recommend this dress!",5
"I just picked this up today in the store and i have to say i really love it! on the site i thought it was just ""meh"" but in person the space dye is interesting and the seam detail make the sweater better than i expected. it definitely runs large, i sized down to an xs (usually a s, size 4/6) and it's still slouchy and comfortable without looking sloppy, the dolman sleeve gives you plenty of room in the chest and the neck isn't at all tight. it's soft and just an overall cute sweater!",5
Flowing top that looks great with skinny slacks... makes a great and comfortable work outfit.,5
"Lovely top, well made and feels wonderful on. attention petites - i highly suggest you go for petite sizing because the standard xs is ginormous and looked nothing like it does on the model pictured.",5
"When i opened the package i knew i was in love. the colors are vibrant-true to the photo. the fabric is delicious, soft and silky, the perfect weight for a warm summer day. these can be dressed up or down. i am 5'9"" 140lbs. i bought the medium and they fit with plenty of room.

i would highly reccomend these shorts-just gorgeous! come on summer!",5
"I love this coat! it does run a bit large. i am 5'2, 125 pounds and usually, wear a petite in most retailer clothes. i ordered a small, but wish that i would have ordered the xs. the length of the jacket is fine, but the arms are very long. i think that i might have the arm length hemmed, but it looks ok rolled up too.",5
This shirt is wonderful! i totally recommend it for everyone.,5
"Grabbed this off the sales rack-not expecting much-but it is a great sweater! like other reviewers mentioned-roomy but still form fitting. i wear it to work with black pants and boots and it looks great. cozy, warm, very cute. i usually wear a small but got an xs in this. a much better sweater than how it appears in the online pics.",5
"Beautiful dress. not lined, but the fabric is sturdy enough. i do prefer a slip under but that is my preference for most things. great for dressing up or down. so comfortable.",5
"Once this caught my eye, i couldn't let it go. i kept revisiting it...thinking it was too expensive, probably itchy,
too bulky, a problem if you wanted to eat something.
but the color looked yummy so i finally ordered it....
and i'm so pleased i did! 
the shape is actually easy to wear - it's not chopped. it drapes nicely over my hips and it isn't itchy.
i would not wash the dishes with this sweater on...but you could dress it up with velvet pants for a party or 
more casually with jeans.",5
"Love, love, love this dress! i needed a fun but not over the top dress for family pictures and this was perfect. great pop of color and looked amazing with over the knee boots. i see myself wearing this thru the holidays and will likely throw on with a jean jacket. i found it true to size - my normal size 4 fits me well. buy this dress - you won't regret it!",5
This fits like a dream! the almost three quarter length sleeves are perfection. worth every penny!,5
"I actually like the fit - but i guess it depends on your overall body type. i too ordered a small and medium. i actually could fit the small, but preferred the room in the medium. the movement on these are spectacular and the material is light and cool.",5
"Although seemingly simple, this hooded sweater top is actually versatile. wear with jeans or leggings, even a skirt. wear over a cami, tank or even sleeved top. i do like the delicate nature of this piece and it does appear to be made well enough to be durable. would recommend.",5
"I read some of the other reviews and was surprised about comments that the color was off... i thought they were pretty dead on. i absolutely love this jacket, but do agree that it's more of a sweater-coat than a heavy coat you'd wear in the winter. but, i live in california, so this will be just perfect for our winter. i was afraid it might be too ""classic"" and uptight looking... but it's so fun! the bell sleeves add some extra flair. the overall coat has some stretch to it as well... making it",5
"I love this dress.i have it in black and am about to buy it in the blue..i'm usually a 4 but i bought a size 2. it is light and flattering with the gathering above the waist....does tend to crease a bit, but it's not too bad. love the way it can be dressed up or down (think boots or vans or sandles). i will dress it up to go out, but also throw it on to pick the kids up from school.",5
I do not know where to begin....this sweater exceeds my expectation! i ordered this along with the mes demoiselles fringed sweater and i thought that was the game stopper....as beautiful as that one is...this one made my mouth fall open. it is unlike anything i have. it is an oversized substantial chic piece that is all over the runways. not to mention the color that i can not stop staring at and it will go with everything! order your regular size as it is suppose to be big!,5
"I love everything about this dress. cute, comfortable, easy to wear. it does wrinkle a little and it's not lined but otherwise, i love it.",5
"Every once in a while, i randomly pick something from the sales floor that really knocks it out of the park. print is subtle and pretty, crochet neck really lightens up the look of a long top with a lot of coverage. it's cut perfectly--beautifully drapes without being so flowy it's mistaken for maternity. worth full price! word of warning, i saw one top on the rack with a small amount of crochet that was unraveling, so may need to check before buying. i'm usually a size 6-8, purchased size small",5
"I bought this dress in the blue print and love it! the drape is lovely and its not too short. i feel like it can be dressed up or down. i plan to wear it to a wedding at the end of the month. for reference, my measurements are 36-27-38 (chest 36d and height 5'4) and i ordered the small. i'm usually a small-medium but went with a small based on other reviews. i have a short torso as well and i feel this dress fits perfectly, not too small or too large. as other reviewers stated, there is no linin",5
"I can't say enough about this top! absolutely adorable, the pics don't do it justice. it is made of a soft, medium weight jersey material. the lace makes the top more dressey and unique. the drop waiste elongatesy our torso and is loose pleated at the bottom for interest. i am 5'6'', 135 pounds, and long waisted. this fits me perfect (sz small.) the pleated bottom on me begins at low hips (below belly button) so it layes nice and is very flattering. no swing to the top,no bulky extra flare at al",5
"This is a stunning, flattering, well-designed and sized, magnificent, and yet wearable, comfortable summer blouse! i am a busty, 34f, size 8, and this lovely piece makes me look amazing. i most highly recommend to any woman. the 100% cotton body has a very soft feeling and a little bit of ""give"". i experienced no pulling at the chest or back, which can happen for me. the bottom 2"" of the crochet v is backed by the body of the top, so you may not need a cami. the combination of leaf print/crochet",5
"Love this dress and have bought the style in three color/pattern variations. fits comfortably, looks polished yet effortless. appreciate that the sleeves come closer to the elbow, gives it a vintage vibe.",5
"I love the simplicity of this. it's not fussy at all. i fell in love with the green color online. fortunately someone had returned a green to my closest store though it wasn't my size. the color is even better in person.i tried on the blue (also pretty) in a 8 and 10, as i'm all over the place in retailer sizing. i could've taken either but the 10 had too much material on top for me. i ordered the 8. i'm hoping it won't be too short for church.",5
"This ia a great casual top...the design flaws mentioned in previous reviews are what gives it a trendier look...the length is perfect but i needed to size down from a large to medium because the fit was a bit loose on the body and arm...would like to add that while it is good quality it's still somewhat overpriced for a t -shirt material top, lace accent..",5
"I was worried about ordering this top after the first review, but i was very pleasantly surprised. the sweater is a nice weight on the front panel, and a lighter weight knit on the back panel, which gives it a ""flowy"" quality. it looks slender and trim in front, with the unexpected surprise in back. the transition between the front and back panels is well done, which doesn't really show in the photos. i purchased the yellow sweater and had many compliments on it's uniqueness the first time i wor",5
"I love this skirt! it is unique and flattering clothes like this skirt, that brought me to retailer in the first place. as the first reviewer said, this is a well-made striking skirt. it is tts (i usually wear a size 2 - and the size 2 fit perfectly; i am 36-17-36, and 122 lbs, 5'4"".) the skirt is lined and is very comfortable to wear.",5
Tried this after missing out on the very similar terra max dress where petite sizes sold out. the medium is perfect and the style can be dressed up. wore it on a day out and two strangers complimented me on the 'great dress'!,5
Was pleasantly surprised at house nice this too was! the colors are beautiful.  the top is  flowy and drapes nicely.  true to size. i'm a 4/6 and ordered a small.,5
"I love this shirt. it is very soft and the lace on the sleeves adds an extra element. i liked this shirt so much, that i ordered a second one.",5
"This dress looked ok in the hanger, but oh my on was so much better. quality is great, i love the fabric and that it has pockets.
i'm 5'8 and normally a ddd usually a large too...so i worried about the size - the medium fits great everywhere",5
"This tank is very loose fitting, which i can understand would make some think it runs large. taking into account the fabric and the twisted straps, i personally think it would look ridiculous if it was more fitted. i love the draped styling, which i also think makes sense with the pattern. it's an easy top too...just throw on and go. and the loose fit is perfect for the disgustingly hot and humid summer months here in the midwest.",5
"I ordered this dress in both a petite xs and regular xs and the petite fit the best. for the first time in my life i did not have to shorten a maxi dress and i am 4ft 10""! 
the color is a beautiful dark blue( not sure why the color online says charcoal) and the opening at the chest area is a little low, but nothing that double sided tape can not fix.  another bonus, as other reviewers have stated,  is that you can wear a regular bra. lastly it does not wrinkle, so you can bring this on vacation",5
"I loved the design and light weight quality. reference i'm 5'4, 125..i ordered a small, it's a tad big but i can handle it. because of the neck line, you must wear a strapless bra.",5
"This top does run quite large. i am normally an xs or s in tops (i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34a), and i was debating between the xs and xsp. the xxs was out of stock, so i wasn't able to try it on for size. the xs is noticeably longer and fits more like it does on the model, but it was also a little too low cut for me on top. the straps are twisted and not adjustable, so i went with the xsp, which is what i'm wearing in the photo. it does come up a little shorter, but it fits me better in the bust. the f",5
Very nice and the sleeve have a great design and the length is finally long enough,5
"My imagination went wilt with all of the possible combinations for this vest. dressy and casual...with jeans or slacks; long or short pencil; leather too!
best gift to date.",5
"This is a great sweater. great color and style. i love that it's a little retro. can be worn with jeans and tights. highly recommend. it does run a little big, but not by a lot.",5
"I have been looking for a nice, white tunic and i should have known when i saw this was one size fits all. maybe because i am petite (5'2"") but there was so much material hanging everywhere that it made me look even shorter and fat. who wants that? so sending it back.",1
"Love everything about this top! comfortable yet classy, dress it up or down depending on occasion. beautiful design.",5
This blouse is very unique due to the pretty piped design on the back. looks great with jeans. the front is shorter and more tailored than the back. i love this blouse!,5
"The flower print really caught my eye. i like the unique twisted neckline. there is a lot of material here, but it hangs nicely without billowing out like some other unfortunate tops.",5
"This dress is amazing. based upon its rack appearance i never would have tried this dress on but the fabric was irresistibly soft so i gave it a try. i was amazed to see it fit so well. i'm very curvy (125lbs, 5'4"", 32dd ) so normally a dress without structure doesn't work on me but this one somehow does. the elastic waist hits right at the smallest part of my waist (i'm very short waisted if that helps) and flows from there beautifully. i think the v-cut at the chest area help reduce the appear",5
I'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews. the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh. it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i've every tried on at retailer. i'm 5'4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume.,1
"This shirt is so cute. it's so soft, love the lace element on the arm. definitely thinking of ordering the white. the back for me is a lot longer then the pic shows but i think it looks good.",5
I have worn this dress twice and it is amazing. the material feels heavy and drapey but i still feel nice and cool in it. i always have several people asking me where i bought it when i wear it. i am 5'1 130 lbs and 34 d. i bought a small petite and it fit perfectly. i love this dress and would highly recommend it to anyone. definitely one of the best things i've ever bought from retailer.,5
I wasn't sure about this top when i saw it on line but it is actually nicer than the picture. it is very flattering and the color is perfect for the summer!,5
"I got this dress in pxxs in the gray color, i am 5'4"", 100lbs, petite frame, and it fits like a dream. true to size. the fabric is super soft and thick, drapes well, not too tight, and u can wear a regular bra!!!. length is also perfect, no shortening required (which is rare for me - this could be an issue for tall girls but i wouldnt know about that). it looks great with dressy flip flops for any summer occasion, can be casual or dressy depending on accessories. great purchase, 100% recommend.",5
I was looking for long vest to go with skinny jeans. this is exactly what i was looking for. the color is better than the pic to me. the style is flattering.. the size is just right. can't wait to wear it. i strongly recommend it.,5
"Just agreeing with all the good reviews.  love the color, feel, fit and versatility.  you can look sexy or modest depending on your underpinnings and accessories.  drapes over and disguises my figure flaws.  this is a three season dress for me and i look forward to having this in my rotation in the years to come.  i bought regular hem instead of petite.",5
"My husband bought it for me and i was a bit skeptical at first. tried it on and absolutely loved it. besides the really soft fabric, it has pockets which makes it even more comfortable for me! i'm 5'8"", 123lbs. and flat chested. he got me a medium, which fits a bit tight, but my husband likes it so it's a keeper!",5
I bought this recently and it is already a go-to piece in my wardrobe. i love it to dress things up for work. it is extremely comfortable and easy to wear.,5
I'm not one for writing reviews but i thought i would for this absolutely beautiful skirt. i saw it in-store before it became available on-line and knew i had to have it. i don't like exposed zippers but in this case the gold zipper is a nice detail on the skirt. i'm curvy with a very small waist so the fit was fine. i would definitely recommend this product!,5
This is the best ever t-shirt i've ever worn. feels so soft! looks gorgeous! very comfortable and yet has that bit of sparkle that makes it perfect for a special evening with friends etc! just love the fit- it makes me look slimmer:),5
I was surprised i was the 1st to review this t- i got it on black friday & loved the fit and look immediately! i wear w skinny jeans and boots but also converse or ... many options and a good price!,5
"I purchased this early in summer and have worn it a lot. you can dress it up or down, and since it's comfortable you will want to wear it a lot. i can wear it for everything from walking the dog to going out to dinner.. i bought 2 jumpsuits this summer and this is by far my favorite. the fit is flattering, fitted but not tight and the self-tie belt gives your waist definition so the overall look is hourglass. i am tall and i normally take an xs or s. i went with the s to ensure that it was long",5
"This little number is really cute, i got it on sale, after i looked at it, went home, slept and decided i had to go ack for it:-0
i will wear it with trouser jeans and a blazer for work, or jsut jeans and boots for casual wear.",5
Such an amazing shirt to dress down for a long day at school,5
"I'm 5'10"" and have athletic legs. these jeans are so comfy, long enough, and look good on the booty. the photo is deceiving as they are much longer. i wish they carried more colors. it's hard to find a jean i really like and i really like these.",5
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion, totally worth the price. it's very, very well made and fits perfectly. i usually wear a size 4 but with skirts that are supposed to sit right at my waist, i size down to 2 so they fit properly. i did that with this one and i have to wiggle a bit to get it past my hips but once on it fits like a glove. i'm 5'11"" and the skirt comes to mid-calf on me which is exactly what i was looking for. love love love this skirt, i totally recommend it.",5
"The first reviewer was right about this dress--checked her review before buying it. it's a beautiful creation and perfectly designed, and it's also slimming. i was worried that the fit might be too tight in the skirt, but it is fine. highly recommended.",5
"I bought the blazer in the grey motif color. it is definitely a taupe color versus grey but it does look as pictured.i bought a small after trying it on in store. i think it runs a bit small as i mostly wear xs at retailer. the arms are very fitted in my opinion, so if you have bigger arms, it might feel too snug. you don't really see this detail in the picture but the lapel folds differently on each side, meaning one folds back higher than the other, so it isn't a symmetrical look. i actually lik",5
"It's really a casual tee, but with the cute pattern that gives a pop of color, it can have a little more dressed to go out look. i thought it might be a bit wide by the picture, but has a nice flattering flow. a bit expensive at full price but an amazing score on sale.",5
"Fits great, not too tight/baggy. pattern on shirt is pretty and should work for layering or wearing on its own.",5
"This jumpsuit is so pretty and fits perfectly. i am 5'2"", 102 lbs. and 32c and got the xsp and the proportions are perfect. i wondered if the pattern would be too overwhelming or busy on a petite frame but it's not at all and fits like a glove. i removed the little loops that hold the belt because they stuck out too far. easy to throw on when i'm out and about with my kids or dress it up with heels or a wedge for night! love!",5
I wish we had cooler weather in california so i could wear this more often. i bought this sweater/coat on sale plus an extra 20% off so i got a great deal on it. i love this sweater! it looks matronly in the picture but it looks very chic and sophisticated in person. the sleeves hit above the wrist as shown on the model. it does have pockets. it's the right weight for chilly weather.,5
"This top is beautiful! it drapes just like the picture with gorgeous details in the back. this is what i expect from retailer! i am 5'4"", 120# and 34b and took my size small so i would say tts. i tried it on with a strapless nude colored bra and it was not visible. give it a try you won't regret it!",5
"I always go w/ black, but deviated this time & so glad i did! quality fabric, not sheer at all. a great layering piece and new staple for the wardrobe. fits tts, sm (i'm 5'2"", 109lbs)",5
Great fit and very cute design. goes great with jeans.,5
"I didn't even notice this tee online, but in person in the store, i instantly loved it. then trying it on, loved it even more. it is flattering without being too tight. i got an xs, which is my usual size. i'm not a huge fan of the 3/4 sleeve length in winter, so i almost wish it had been either long or short sleeve, but no biggie, i still love!",5
"Love this dark gray heathered blazer ( no stripes, contrary to its name)! very easy to wear with the bit of spandex, and not hot or heavy like my tailored wool blazers. i am usually a petite medium but decided to order petite large to better accomodate layers or sweaters, sleeve length perfect even with sweater on. will get lots of wear with this dress-up or dress-down piece!",5
"I don't normally spend so much on t shirts but this one is worth it. really well made and quite unique. i reckon i'll get a lot of use out of it,",5
"I probably wouldn't have even tried this on in the store, but i took a chance when it was on sale. i put it on and it was immediate love. the fit is perfect. i am between a medium and a large and got it in a large. it is not boxy, but not too tight either. it feels well made.",5
"So glad i bought this!! its beautiful and being on sale made it even better. good quality and versatile, highly recommend.",5
"Love this top. purchased in a size medium, my typical retailer size and is very comfortable and lovely. wearing it under the pink peplum cardigan it was shown together with as well as wear it with jeans and other pants. i wish it came in different colors and other images as this a very well made top. purchased during the after christmas tag sale and love it even more. will be great in spring and summer, cooler days in summer.",5
"I tried on the grey motif yesterday, and it was the one thing i tried on that i loved, and the only thing i bought. i'm 5'4 34 dd 125 lbs, and the xs was a perfect fit for me. i sometimes find that retailer stuff is tight in the arms, so i generally wear a small, but i tried on the small, and the arms were a bit baggy. i plan on wearing tanks underneath, so the xs was the right call. if you want to wear something thicker & long sleeved underneath, go with your usual size.",5
This is the perfect throw on little blazer-like jacket that feels like a sweatshirt! i loved it so much (on sale) that i bought another one in a different color. i am 5'0'' and 115lbs and the xs fits like a glove. it is so great. well made. so comfortable. versatile. dress it up for work or down with a pair of jeans.,5
"This. jumpsuit. is. amazing.

i ordered the small, and it fits perfectly - loose and flowy, with room for boobs (i'm a 32d) and hips. perfect for humid summers when you'd rather your clothing hang a bit away from your body. the fabric is deceptively light for how it hangs (in a very flattering way) when i have it on. 

i would say that if you're shorter than 5'4"", the petite is the way to go. however, i am 5'4"" and the length hit me almost exactly where it is on the model. i lifted the leg a",5
"I'm 5'8"" about 134, somewhat of a pear, and these jeans in size 28 fit like they were made for me. plus, the fabric is really soft and comfortable and i love the color. ankle opening is more straight than skinny, which is a change from my usual skinny jeans, but i like it.",5
"This skirt is so beautiful!! it's a bit small, but only a tad. i can still wear it, and it encourages me to lose 5lbs haha! i get compliments everywhere i go.",5
"Great jeans in a lovely shade of grey. they are longer than shown in the picture, however, which i love. i haven't worn mine yet, and i wonder how stretched out they'll get, but overall the fit is quite flattering.",5
"I purchased this blazer in both striped versions for work. it's basically a blazer/sweatshirt hybrid!

while it does run true to size, i can wear a small or medium in retailer; i purchased medium in this. don't size down if your size is ambiguous!",5
"I purchased this on a whim and i'm so glad i did. this is a gorgeous piece. fabric is soft very feminine and stylish. quality is outstanding. it can be worn with a dress or jeans. lovely shades of pink and soft gray. i live in florida, so it's a bit heavy for hotter weather, but will be great on a cool spring day. love it!",5
"I love this top soooooo much! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back, since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness. i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight, and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top. it is comfortable, even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms. i love that the colors are not bold, i am sick of neon!!!!",5
"This is an absolutely gorgeous dress. i have the arcata patchwork dress which fits beautifully without looking too full, but this one is just too voluminous. also, the bottom of the front yoke hits at a weird spot on my bust. this would be a great maternity dress or it would be perfect for a thin woman who can carry off the large amount of fabric. so disappointed, the fabric is beautiful and the colors are too. this can be worn year round, with sandals or boots.",5
"As soon as i opened the package, i knew that this is going to be my all time retailer favorite. many reviewers mentioned how puffy the sleeves are but i see it as quite proportioned with the rest of the dress. tts i am 5'5"" and 128lb, ps fits perfect. i am an addict of retailer dress <3",5
"I popped into retailer the other day just to look around, and saw this dress - the fabric stood out first, then i saw the cut and style, and fell in love! they only had xs and s, and i'm usually a m because of my chest (34d) but it looked so voluminous, i thought i'd try it on. the s fit perfectly! the bodice fit a bit more closely, and the rest of the dress flowed beautifully beneath it. the sleeves are quite large, but it's kind of a fun look and feel. it's got a very ""peasant princess"" feel to",5
"It's the perfect sweatshirt! super comfortable, but also cute! i am 5'4'' and 125 pounds, and the size 0 fits perfectly.",5
"A beautiful, comfortable dress with it's own unique style. a must to add to your wardrobe",5
"Kind of silky, but to a point where they almost look like pj pants. i am not sure if i will keep, but overall nice feel. i tried on a xxs p as it was a return, xs sold out, so went with it, stretchy enough to fit me... (115 lbs)",5
"This is a great staple for laid back weekend wardrobe. the inside of the pullover is soft, like sweatshirt material, and its comfortable enough to sleep in. also cute enough to wear out with jeans. i would definitely recommend this sweatshirt. i'm typically a size 0 in retailer - i ordered this shirt in a size 1 and i love the fit.",5
"Lush eye catching print. saw it, tried it on and had to have it, full price or not. very comfortable. bought one size down and it fit perfectly.",5
"I love this dress! it's so comfy and flowy. i wore to an event and got many compliments on the color and design of the dress. i'm 5'5"" and weigh 150.",5
"I love this dress! i ordered a petite size and just love how it fits. i would highly recommend this dress, too cute!",5
"This is a gorgeous dress... great print, comfortable fabric (very wrinkly, though). runs very small. i'm usually a 00 or even sized out at retailer and will need to size up to a 2.",5
"This dress is slightly tight on me and i usually wear petite 00 or xxs (5'1 100 lbs) the quality of the fabric is thick and texture, colors are just like the photo, and it has a nice satin like underlining in a dark navy. the snug fit of the dress makes it so i don't need a bra, which is nice especially for a day dress !",5
"I'm so glad the other reviews were so good. i couldn't agree more. this top is very well made, lined. i'm 5'5"", 32 dd and got the 6. i'll have to take up the shoulders a bit since the v falls a little low on me. what can i say, i'm modest. :) i wish they made more colors. this top is awesome.",5
"Quality is great, fit is great, and the message keeps me in a good mood and motivated throughout the day :)

i got it in a size 2 (i am usually a s-m in retailer tops) and it fits great (for reference 5'4"" 140lbs, 37-29-39).

i usually don't wear grey but the bright colored font led me to make an exception.

very happy with the purchase!",5
Very comfy versatile skirt. the fabric is soft and stretchy that feels really nice on. i live in hawai'i so i like having skirts to wear that work well with the climate but not typical of the fashion out here. the pleating is very flattering and the skirt layer underneath makes it wearable to work.,5
"This dress is so much better in person! i got the petite size (i am 5'2"") and it seems to run a bit smaller than the regular size- i have a fairly large bust so i went up a size and it seems to fit perfectly. love the colors and vintage design! i can't wait to wear it for a wedding i will be attending!",5
I was tempted to get this online but just wasn't sure i wanted to buy even with the sale because i only wear dresses to the knee and didn't know how this would look with leggings or jeans. i tried it on in the store the next day and it was so cute! there are long skinny black tassels in the front that you can't really see in the online pics that i love. it looks great with my skinny jeans with tears or black leggings and boots. i even have some cute leggings just past the knee that this looks aw,5
"I received this as a gift and have seldom been so pleased with anything. as another reviewer noted, some retailer clothing looks darling and then falls apart. not something acceptable at this price point.

unlike her, this was not one of those times. i've worn this daily, for weeks and feel like the buttons, trim and weave could not be any better. not only that but it looks terrific with everything. the sweater has a flattering line that tapers at the waist even unbuttoned. it is soft, warm and cl",5
"This is a great skirt to add to your closet. i love it. it is comfortable, soft, and has detail to it. i enjoy wearing it for work or a night out.",5
"Dress just arrived and i was a bit nervous of the fit based on the other six reviewers stating it runs small. i actually found it to run exactly true to size. i'm 5'6"" 38-26-38 slender, and on average i wear a size 6, which is what i ordered - 6 regular and it fits as though it was custom made for me. this dress is made very well - looks tailored and hits me right above the knee similar to the model. i feel i scored big by purchasing it at the sale price.",5
"The picture of this dress does not do the colors justice. they are a very rich green and pink, which were a popular color combination in the 70's. (i was there!) it adds an authentic touch to this great peasant dress. the black and white embroidery on the bib gives it a modern flair. i am 5'6"", 130 pounds, and usually wear a size six in a dress. the small fit perfect. while the dress is billowy, the square on the back pulls it in, so it doesn't fit like a tent. perfect for boots now, sandals lat",5
"The mara hoffman cross-front one-piece is worth every. single. penny. the colors are vibrant--a perfect compliment for my fair complexion. the cut of the suit is immensely flattering, particularly the definition created at the natural waist. the quality of the suit is impeccable, and i have never felt so confident in such a little number! and guys, it's reversible (inside is a gorgeous royal blue).",5
Beautiful dress! the pics online do not do any justice! i got compliments all day!,5
"The second this dress arrived in my store i knew it was a must have. i am all things bohemian and this dress encompasses everything wonderful about a free fitting, feminine bohemian dress! first off the sleeves are not fitted. they have quite a bit of fabric to them (big armed ladies rejoice!), but have an elastic cuff so you can wear them high or low. the only fitted part to this dress is the lace panel (which still fits true to size), and the slip underneath (which appears to have a bit of str",5
I just got this dress and i love it! it is classic and beautiful. the zipper is tricky right at the band but otherwise no issue there. i cannot wait to wear it.,5
"Just received my dress today and i am pleased with the quality of the dress. i am small on top , small waist with hips and a heavy bottom . i normally. wear a size 8 dress , so i ordered this dress in a size 8 and it was a perfect fit . the material is soft and so comfortable . the zipper was not a issue as mentioned in the other comments . i can't wait to wear this ! my new favorite dress .",5
Usually red tops which are a true red are hard to find. this is more red in person that in the photo. great feel to material and the drape is wonderful. sometimes peplum tops can make me look bigger than i am (5'6 and 138 lbs) but this one has a nice slimming effect and the v-neck is complimentary to a smaller bust 36b. love it !!!!!!!,5
"I saw this online, and liked it but then tried it on in a store a few weeks later, and the pictures truly do not do this gem of a dress justice. the fit is flowy but tts as the cotton lining underneath fits closer to the body. it's an incredibly comfortable and easy piece to wear. the first day i wore this i received so many compliments! the colors are vibrant and it's really just a unique piece with beautiful detailing from the embroidery on the top of the dress to the beads on the ties on the",5
I normally wear 0 in retailer dresses. the bottom is roomy but top from band up runs small. i bought a 2 and love it. i plan to wear it to a wedding.,5
Great as a beach coverup. i paired it with a slip underneath and a belt and it looks amazing! can't wait to wear it on the beaches of the bahamas soon!,5
This was all wrong on me. the puffy sleeves made me look a foot wider. i'm thinking this will look good on tall slim ladies. it is extremely comfortable and the material is very pretty though. tts,5
"Good quality shirt. cute design and not sheer. not quite as loose and stretchy as most of retailer's shirt, but good fit.",5
"I tried this dress on in store. i loved it online, but in person....not so much. it looked and felt like a cheap halloween costume. the fabric was bad. really bad.. the mustard color was beautiful.... boo",1
I love this dress!!! this is perfect for ladies with curves. it does run a little large and i felt i could have worn both the small and the medium. i bought medium because it accentuated my curves without being too revealing. i bought the dark green which is a beautiful color and not see through at all...although i can guess the white might show a little but the white was not available in my store. this will be so perfect for the cold weather.,5
"I loved this purchase. the dress is beautiful. it?s classy, very feminine and rich-looking. the colors and fabric are exactly as shown on a picture. it is tailored and non-stretch, so size has to be right. i am between 6 and 8 and my size m dress fits well. had to spend time shopping for a belt as the dress definitely needs one. gorgeous dress!",5
"I love this top!! in fact if it came in more colors, i'd buy a few more. it's just so soft and comfortable, wear it now in cooler weather with layers or later in spring and even cooler summer nights. the neckline is perfect, love the subtle details. it fits perfect in my usual size medium and is a good length to wear either with jeans or long enough for leggings with a cami peaking out beneath. yes, i love it, just wish there were more colors.",5
"This is a gorgeous dress that while it runs quite small ( i normally take a s or xs ). i had to exchange it for a medium. i am 5 4"" and it falls below the knee which is how i like my dresses. it is a gorgeous pattern of color which could be worn for 3 seasons. i look forward to wearing it for many special occasions.",5
"These jeans are amazing! i just got them from retailer the other day and i have worn them almost every day since! i have washed them once. the tag says to turn inside out, wash in cold, and hang dry. i was a little skeptical that they'd still be soft without the dryer/dryer sheets, but they are wonderful and do not stretch out. i will get lots of use out of them and i just wish they made them in more colors. they're very comfortable: i totally love the high rise. they're a little long but i",5
"These are my new favorite jeans. the gray wash is nice, and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work. the rise is high enough that i don't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button. and the description is true: they don't stretch! i'm a loyal ag stevie shopper, and the fit on these is similar... just a little skinnier in the ankles, maybe. true to size. a little long, so i'll probably hem them a couple of inches.",5
"These are the second pair of paige jeans i have purchased, and i have not been disappointed! jeans are great for casual dress or a night out on the town. fit stays true even after first wash. wish i had a pair of these in every color.",5
Wore this dress last weekend in nyc. wore it from lunch until late night drinks after dinner. walked for hours in the dress. comfortable but dressy.,5
Material is too thin and quality is poor,1
The shirt brings back the '60s look of appliquã©d patches on shirts. it is a quality piece with a bit of humor. the length is shorter than usual for chambray shirts but also very comfortable . it could be left open as a light jacket over tees and tanks. fabric feels good on skin.,5
"I purchased this beauty in the sophisticated dark green on black friday and it has been in constant rotation. it looks chic and classy, feels comfortable and warm. i only wish it was about 2 inches longer, i'm 5'5 and it hits at low thigh, i prefer just above the knee for a winter dress. very practical for walking around city all day and then being ready for a dinner or drinks in style. love it.",5
"Dress is comfortable, feels great and the fit exceeds flattery. the length hits just above my knees and the small side triangle cutouts add a unique cute, fun but still classic detail that i didn't notice in the picture online. i love this dress and get so many compliments.",5
Love the easy fit of this dress. great for work or family events. love the ribbed sleeves and pockets are a plus!,5
I would really like this dress if the material were a little thicker. it's really thin so you can see my nipples straight through the dress. you can't wear a bra with it because it is backless so i don't understand how you are supposed to wear this outside of the house.,1
"I bought this as a swimsuit cover and it was exactly like the picture. so soft, very good quality, fit perfectly. definitely worth it for this price!!!",5
"I ordered this top in my normal size medium, and it was very large. i am 160 lbs, 36b, size 8 top and 12 bottom. it was so pretty, that i took a chance and reordered it in a small. the small on me fits just like the model in the picture. it's pretty lightweight, but is not see through. it is a very wide v-neck, but i am small on top, so it does not bother me. it's such a comfy yet sexy top!",5
"I love this sweater. the pale pink color is gorgeous. i ordered a large because i have broad shoulders, and it fits perfectly. it's a great sweater for any season. love the slits on the sides and the longer back. i would order more if it came in white or black. love it!",5
"Recently received this and was very disappointed with the quality. the fabric was very thin, easily stretched out of shape. price is ridiculous for this item!",1
"Wow. this is the perfect sweater. beautiful, soft color. lightweight enough to wear now and into the coming seasons. it drapes beautifully. the knit is tight, no see through or snags. very soft and comfy. the casual, easy, pulled together look is hard to do and this one does it with style. am starting to love this designer. highly recommend.",5
This top is perfect. i absolutely love this sweater. it is super cute to wear with shirts for the summer and it will look just as cute with jeans for the fall/winter. the color is very subtle and not too pink. it is super soft and i would 100% recommend this to someone!,5
"Just bought these today and they are super soft and beautiful. also, 100% cotton (yay! i hate poly)! thought i should mention though that they do shrink in the dryer. so unless you're skinny, you might want to buy a size up or hang them to dry and then put in the dryer on low to fluff.",5
"I added this to my cart on a whim, and what a nice surprise! the color is gorgeous--this dark plum color is a great alternative to grey, black, or brown. i'm planning to wear it first with a cream sweater, a mustard colored scarf, and a brown leather jacket. i am a pear-shape, and this skirt works very well to structure (and minimize!) my bottom half. it also isn't as short as i thought it might be--although i, like the previous reviewer, plan to wear this with tights and boots. the only negativ",5
"This top is so cute. i don't usually like crochet tops, but when i saw this i just had to order it, so glad i did! my only complaint is that one of the button hooks broke, but that can be fixed.",5
"Love this top - it is a beautiful shade of blue and the buttons at the bottom add a nice touch. it is light weight and not too long or wide. i have other t.la tops in small, but the xsm worked better for me with this top.",5
"Purchased this top at my local store and it is very flattering! not to boxy, hits at the hip and drapes nice. great for work or with jeans. i purchase the navy faux fur scarf to wear around the neck and wow!",5
"I saw this top online and ordered immediately!
i loved the color, lace, and unique details.
sadly it just arrived and it is a disaster!
the lace is stiff and doesn't lay softly, and is very rough against your skin.
the style ( and i like shorter style tops) is extremely boxy and the sleeves protrude outwards in a funny way.,.....
that although i am so in love with this color, i would be embarrassed to wear this top in public.
it could have been fantastic, if the lace was softer, and some a",1
"Very nice casual corduroy skirt for the fall. it sits nicely at the waist and the asymmetrical cut gives it some visual interest. it has a slightly a-line shape and the side seams round up a couple of inches. i took a point off for it not being lined, and the closure relies on the zipper alone instead of having a hook along with the zipper. i took my usual small and like how it fits. my only concern is that it is a little on the short side for me but since it's a fall skirt and will always be wo",5
"Every spring/summer i look forward to t.la's tanks & tees and stock up on them. sometimes it is difficult to determine the color online, but this top (i bought it in green) is without a doubt the same color in person as it is online. the color is a gorgeous sea green and the softest cotton tee (just keeps getting softer wash after wash) and the silver buttons on the side (what a unique twist to an everyday tee). now all i need is the blue one.",5
"I absolutely love these shorts! they are the perfect length, too. i have been looking for shorts this length and rise height for years. it's hard to find shorts that aren't super short yet aren't bermuda and are still flattering. i especially recommend these for those that miss wearing shorts because of insecurities with their thighs/mid-section.

rolls are not sewn on both ends, so you'll have to re-roll each wash.

wish you carried these basics at all times.",5
The color of this top is amazing--much more vibrant than in the photo and the fit is perfect. it is very flirty and pretty and the detailing around the top is gorgeous. it's pricey but i splurged and am glad i did. it looks adorable with a corduroy skirt and boots for the fall.,5
T.la got it right this time. love the fabric. the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green. exactly as pictured. the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons. exactly as it looks on line. i certainly recommend this top. love it.,5
My new favorite socks! has a grip and doesn't slip off like some of my other liner socks have because this one covers more of your feet. perfect for my low boots.,5
Love the color and length of these shorts! i have been searching for a pair of dark denim shorts that were not cut-offs and these pilcro shorts are winning! fit great like all pilcro denim and i'm sure i will be getting a lot of wear (i.e. every day) out of these shorts.,5
"This is a nice looking skirt. the corduroy has a little sheen to it. looks cute with a sweater, tights and boots. length is slightly longer on me than the model in the photo. there are small slits at the side seams and the hem is curved at the slits.",5
Cute denim shorts that roll up or down. perfect with everything.,5
"This is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer, but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear. this brand makes some of the softest, cutest tees, but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry. not worth the cost.",1
"I love the cut and ""swing"" of this tee. the royal blue is very saturated and pretty.",5
"I love everything about this jacket so much that i had to buy three colors (grey/rust/teal). not only is it figure flattering, it's warm, water repellent, easily layered and well made. the little pop of color contrast added to the stripe seam makes it unique. i would say sizing is tts to a bit large. the only thing that would improve the coat is better finishing of the hems.",5
"This brand always makes the softest tees, and so i buy several each season. when i saw this one online, i worried that it might be too long for my short waist, but i decided to order it anyway. success! i ordered my usual size m (for knit tops - 10/12 in fitted ones), and the length was perfect due to the buttons on the side.
fyi: short waist, broad shoulders/back, 36c - i carry my weight in the middle, since i virtually do not have a waistline. so a longer, boxy tee will emphasize the parts of",5
I loved this dress as pictured online and when i received it i fell in love with the look as well as the fit. it is such a perfect dress for the day or night. i am so happy i ordered it.,5
"I got this tunic in the bright red, and it is a great, fun color that leans just slightly to the orange side of red. (my computer screen makes it look more orange than it does in person. i'm happier with the actual color.) the fabric is soft, comfortable and hangs beautifully. wrinkles fall out when you hang it up. i also have the tegan tunic in 2 colors and find the fit to be the same. however, the hi-low hem on this dress is a little more exaggerated than on the tegan. the tegan travels very w",5
"I love this dress! the fabric feels amazing & is super flattering. i am 5'4 with broad shoulders & a 36d chest and went with the small petite. i originally purchased the regular extra small which looked great, i just think the sp was slightly neater though the shoulders & length. it hits me above the knee as shown in the photo of the light colored dress with the long vest",5
"I ordered the taupe version of this tee, which was a medium brown with black stripes. the fabric felt itchy and rough, and was pretty sheer for not being light colored. i didn't care for the fit, which was extremely boxy and wide; from the picture, i expected an a-line fit, but not a wide drop with webbed underarms. i ordered 2 sizes, and could have worn the smaller if i'd kept this tee. it runs on the larger side. what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro",1
"I bought this item in green and then ordered it in red. very comfortable fabric and flattering by itself or over leggings. these tunics will be staple in my closet. i normally wear a medium in retailer dresses, but i ordered a small to have it a bit more fitted instead of baggy. good decision!",5
Lovely foxy sweater. i dressed it down for work but would look fantastic with a pretty skirt too!,5
"Really happy with this tunic. at 5'2 i am able to wear this as a dress or a top (with a belt). it's comfy, light material, and can be dressed up or down.",5
"I am in love with this dress. it's super soft, flattering  and comfy i want to wear it everyday. it was recommended to me by a friend who is taller and slimmer than i am so i was skeptical of the fit. sometimes you see things that are only meant for models to wear. so not true here. i am 5'3"" 140 pounds with slightly broad shoulders and i bought an xs. i'm considering getting a second one.",5
"I also have this dress in 3/4 sleeve, tegan tunic. i love this dress. it can be dressed up or down.",5
"I ordered a xxs petite based on previous reviews but it was too short and snug in the shoulders. i then tried on the regular xs and it fit nice.y. loose but it is the style (shoulders fit). i usually need xs petite so kind of true to size to me. i am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs. color is nice, i liked the blue polka dot with flowery tie neck. the tie. neck is a. nice. on trend feature, can. be tired at different heights for different looks, i think i will keep the xs regular....",5
"I ordered the ivory in size xl. it is such a cute, comfortable top. all of the details are well-done. the quality of the material is great too. it's a flowy fit. after washing & air-drying, it does shrink a bit. great tee for summer!",5
"I have had this dress for a few months now and find it is super comfortable for the hot weather and can go dressy or casual with the right accessories. it does run large in xxs; the xxs petite fit a little better by was way too short for me. even better is that you can wash on the super gentle cycle and lay flat to dry. yes it says dry clean only, but its is made of cupro and you should be able to wash that material. i have washed mine several times and it has never shrunk or lost shape. the she",5
"This is such a fun version of a v-neck tshirt. the lines and seams are very flattering, the neckline is perfect. i'm 5'10"" a size 10/12 (depending) and i ordered the medium in the navy which fit perfectly. the length was slightly shorter on me than the model. overall a great shirt. highly recommended.",5
"Got this top in white and the rust color. other reviewers mentioned it being much too large, so i went with the xs instead of my usual small. it's slightly oversized, but i love that look, and it's still flattering on me. i also didn't find there to be too much fabric. i am very tall and am happy with the length of this. 34b, 126 lbs, 5'10""",5
"Purchased in the blue polka dot and love it. am 5' 6 1/2"", 155lbs, long arms. dress is meant to be full. i don't see the ""that is runs large"". the shoulders fit, the sleeves are not too long. it is a very cute dress. after receiving the dress, ordered it in the black motif and hope to like it just as much as the blue.",5
"This one is a must-buy. i have 3 of the longer sleeve version (the tegan dress) and one of these. i am about to buy more of the lola/ short sleeved version. these dresses are flattering and comfortable. they can be worn as a tunic with leggings or a dress. they are great for travel. if you roll them, they don't wrinkle. they can be dressed up or down. my sister and i have very different figures and this dress looks great on both of us. i can't recommend a dress more. the lola and the tegan are t",5
"I absolutely love everything about this top! i bought it in the taupe/navy stripes version and got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is eq",5
"I love the details of this top: the pleats and ruffles are so pretty and the fit is flattering, especially if you have a tummy. the arm holes aren't gaping like so many tops, so you don't even need a cami underneath to hide your bra. it is a bit on the larger side. i often wear a large, but i got a medium and i may have even been able to get away with a small.",5
"This dress is gorgeous. i purchased it recently to wear to my civil wedding ceremony and it is absolutely perfect. it is light, flowy, and comfortable, but the details make it special. the sheer sleeves give it ethereal vibe that i love. the quality seems to be extremely high as well. if you are looking for a white dress that is casual, but still unique and beautiful, please give this one a shot. i cannot wait to wear it on my special day!",5
"Adorable & comfortable. i'm 5'3"" and 115 lbs. i ordered an xs. it hits at my knees and is not see through. the color is pinkish in person which i like more than the photo.",5
"I absolutely love this top.....the color, style, fit..everything! i took another reviewers advice and sized down from my normal large to a medium. i have had so many compliments wearing this top. it is very feminine, flows nicely, hangs well. love the color. can't recommend this enough!",5
"I own another dolan dress which is virtually the same as this but has long sleeves. i wear the long-sleeved one whenever i give presentations or readings. the material is absolutely genius for travel. just unpack, shake it out and you're good to go.
i love the sleeves on this short-sleeved version. i'm fairly fit but at my age i'm not excited about showing off my arms! the drape is beautiful and i can wear high heels, bootees or flats with it. i bought the red. sometimes you can't tell if the c",5
"Thylo strikes again! this dress was magic the second i put it on - flowy, polka-dot magic! this baby can transform itself as you go from a casual day out to an dressy evening, with plenty of customizable options in between. to dress down, it looks great with a denim jacket, then take the jacket off and you are ready for some dressed up fun. you can pair it with tall boots or short, sandals, pumps, you name it. the ties at the neck look great undone, loosely tied, or done in a bow. leggings or ti",5
This is a great summer top! love the way it drapes and the quality of the material. bought the ivory and went back for the rust but my size is sold out. my only complaint is that it doesn't come in way more colors!,5
"I love the muted red pleated ruffle tank. i usually wear a large in retailer tops. this top fit a bit loose. there is a bit more space around the armholes. this only concerns me because i can't wear a bra or cami without it showing. just mentioned this in case others may wish to buy one size smaller. i am 68, around 5/5"" and weight 144 lbs. love the young, modern tops that i find at retailer. i just ordered the white version of this tank top in a medium to see how it will fit (btw, there is a",5
What a great light dress for spring and summer evenings. i love the length and the laid back style. this dress is true to size.,5
This dress fits and hangs so nicely. it is so versatile as well. dress it up or down!,5
"I loved this dress when it came out last spring in gray. this year, i got the red and sand color. it wears so easy and can be dressy or casual- depends on how you want to wear it. i would say each color fits differently, try them on. the dress is worth the price.",5
I bought this yesterday in store in the red color. normally i wouldn't spend this much money on an everyday dress- but there was no way i could walk out of the store without it! the fabric and fit are amazing. the dress has a chic-ness about it that makes you look completely put together but doesn't make you look like you are trying too hard. perfect balance of comfort and style. i'm seriously thinking i need it in black as well!,5
Love this. bought the cream in store and the burgundy online. perfect alone or to wear under an retailer sweater.,5
I saw this in the store in blue and loved it. wore it and received lots of compliments. just bought the second color online as there is free shipping today. great dress for work as the weather is warming up.,5
"Wonderful and comfortable dress, very sweet.",5
I love that this top is double layered so it prevents any sheerness. the cream colored trim on the white top is really pretty- great combo. has a shabby chic feel. the fit is nice through the shoulders and eases up through the body - not fitted which i like.,5
"I purchased this dress for a baby shower and it was just perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 pounds and ordered the petite xs which fit great. the dress is supposed to be a tad oversized and flowy so this size worked out great for me! it will also be a nice transition piece into spring with a pair of black fringe booties :) overall, i recommend this dress!!",5
"This is the perfect little throw-on dress. flattering, uber-comfortable, nice fabric. i found that it runs slightly large.",5
So i notice most ladies on retailer love to say how tiny they are. so some of us that are busty and have a hip--this is nice. i actually could've done a medium but the large was the only one and on sale. it's meant to be loose! it's kind to ladies that aren't all size 2 :),5
"This dress is so pretty in person. the colors are great - the blue and green and just beautiful in person. the fit is tts. i happen to have a blue belt and could style it just as the model has, but really it doesn't need it. it is super flattering even without a belt. i am just a hair shy of 5'5"", and i cannot wear flats or it would drag the floor. but adding a 2 1/2"" wedge is perfect to keep it off the floor (no hemming needed). i don't usually pay full price, but i am glad i did in this case.",5
Flowy boho tank. great details. good fabric. wear under a long cardigan or with a pair of denim cut offs and a necklace. oversized fit. i would size down one size.,5
"This is an awesome tank top, comfortable, great fit, casual but with ruffles a bit dressier than an ordinary tank top. i loved it so much i came back and bought it in the cream color. this runs a bit larger and i typically take an extra large but bought this in large and its perfect.",5
"Love this romper. fits perfectly, and looks like the picture. i'm 5 ft 7, 125 lbs, and usually am a size 4 or small. i ordered a small, and it fits beautifully. i've worn this a lot this summer in florida, and am getting a lot of compliments. don't be put of by the long sleeves for summer wear- the romper is loose enough and has a nice flow to it.",5
"Very cute on, fits well. versatile top, i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall.",5
Cool cut and texture a winner,5
It's really not in my typical wheelhouse. i took a chance based on reviews. the shorts are long and roomy enough. and i love it with the long-sleeves. i somehow feel less exposed in it than i thought i would. i do agree with the comment that the material feels pretty flimsy for the price point. that's a bummer.,5
"This romper is my new go to outfit for a summer night out. the material is light weight, not flimsy. you could dress up or down. the bottoms are the perfect length. i'm a bit short-waisted, 5'7"",125lbs and the small fit.",5
"I just recently received this dress in the mail. i went up a size to a 10, i am usually a 6 or 8. it fit perfectly. the top is very fitted and the bottom flows nicely. i really like this dress and am looking forward to wearing it to work or out.",5
"I bought this dress when i saw it go on sale, and i am glad i did! love how it fits the length everything about it. it is true to size and it looks very flattering, i will be wearing it for my anniversary date with my husband. highly recommend! i am 130 lbs, 34d, and the size 6 fit perfectly!",5
This dress was just perfect. the fit was just right and it is made well. love the ruffles... could definitely be dressed up or wore casual. great dress all around ... a keeper!!!,5
"After reading the other reviews, i took a chance and ordered the peach one and the blue (red?) one in large. i am usually at the top end of xl's, but i've noticed that holding horses items tend to run a bit bigger. i hit the jackpot with this one. yes, it's a little ""boxy"". all the better to hide what i want to hide. the length is perfect for me and the gathers at the shoulders give enough room across the chest so that it doesn't pull at the buttons. the peach one came today, and i was a bit sur",5
"Love this piece! i hope to see more cute, fun dresses like this from retailer. the greatest feature is it is super comfortable! it could be worn to a great number of events, dressed up or down for any occasion.",5
"Love, love this dress! the fit is perfect, the cut is feminine and flirty but not too showy and bare. there is the perfect amount of swing and it's a great length, i can't say enough about it. i think it's worth the price, which i have to admit, i was hesitant about. so comfortable and versatile! i see it being worn quite often!
keep dresses like this coming!
btw, the neck line is flattering on every body type!
for reference, i'm 5'3"" and weigh 110 lbs and i purchased a size 2, but i think a",5
Someone recommended to size up if u have large breast and i am glad i did! it fits like a dream! this is the cutest dot dress i have ever tried.,5
"I literally bought this dress 2 days ago and now it is listed as ""no longer available"" on the retailer site. i am a size 12 with about a 36b-c bust. the thing i love about this dress is that it looks really nice without a bra. i was really surprised at how well constructed it was.",5
"Perfect for dressing up or dressing down with a pair of jeans. this pullover can be worn during all four seasons of michigans weather, which is a bonus for me. it can also be paired with heels, booties or flats making it extremely versatile.",5
"I really liked this shirt the one time i got to wear it...but when i washed it, according to the directions on the tag, it shrunk! a lot! the sleeves are now too tight, and it is much shorter. thinking about returning it to the store, but in any case, i cannot wear it again.",1
This dress is flattering and seems to be made well. the polka dots add interest. i am usually a 2 and did go up to a 4 in this. .,5

"I wasn't sure how this was going to look on me, but it was so darned cute, i had to give it a try. and i love it! i'm 5'4"" around 130lbs and i bought both a small and a medium to try. the medium fit best. the length is perfect. hits just a little bit longer than the model but almost the same. the material is light but nothing see thru about it. it is slimming and looks so cute on! so glad i gave it a try.",5
This romper checks off all the boxes! it's beautiful and the fit is perfect!,5
"This is m frist pair of flares, and i love them--make my legs look miles long and they're also my most comfortable jeans. i'm 5'4 and around 108 lbs with narrow hips--the 25 fits perfectly. i've worn them with 3 inch heels and the jeans dust the floor (longer than on the model but i like that look; if i wanted to wear them with flats they'd need to be hemmed, but i prefer heels anyway) ii've avoided high-rise jeans out of fear they'd look matronly, but combined with the flare, the high waist is",5
"I was really lucky to pick up these shorts during the tag sale, and they are great! lightweight, roomy in the legs (way more my speed, i prefer shorts that don't cling) and really soft. they also weren't too short. i am usually between two sizes at retailer, depending on the brand, and ended up going with the smaller size. they're not really a size too big, but would've been a little too roomy/baggy in the waist, had i not purchased the smaller.",5
"I purchased this romper over a month ago and love it! i ordered a s and would say that it is true to size. it falls well and i love the blousy look on top. it is expensive at full price, but i purchased it with a promotional discount. luckily, before i washed this (as the tag says handwash only), i read the reviews in which some reviewers had said that they followed the directions and it still shrunk. i let it sit in my hamper until today after i read online about using dryel and rayon. dryel in",5

"I ordered these because of the side zipper, but they zip in front, even though the order listing and bag label called them ""wine, side zip pants."" they were also at least two sizes larger than marked and very flimsy material. what bothers me is that i was charged $5.95 to send them back, even though the product description (and the name before someone changed it on the website) were wrong.",1
"I want to address that with lightweight but not too skimpy for the summertime, and the stress works perfectly. i got the red in a small, and although one reviewer said that she did not like that the top and bottom are two different materials i actually think it's super cute. not sure if i would pay the full price, but the 20% off sale made it worth it.",5
I love these pilcro cropped chinos. i ordered them in the sand and will be ordering them in the grey. they are very soft and comfortable,5

"This is my favorite weekend jacket! it is so cute, soft and comfortable! the interior is an extra soft cotton that feels like my most favorite soft tee-shirt?? it is true to size. the best features are the versatility of the neck, pockets. and a little longer in the back - great over leggings/yoga pants. i ordered 2 sizes just in case the sizing was off - an xxs and xxs. i am a 2 petite and the xs is roomy enough for a sweater or sweatshirt under it. the xxs looked and felt great too and had a m",5
"I'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are. i ordered the petite small, and i'm always a small. these are huge. i felt like i had on a large. i like the thin material and color, and i'm sad that they are so large.",1

"This sweater is adorable. i got it in the grey pattern. it's got a great, forgiving fit, lots of stretch, with a hi-low waist, in a thick, soft knit and 3-quarter sleeves. the contrasting collar and cuffs add interest. it's great with jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. i can't wait for the weather to cool down so i can wear it. i might get it in more colors, too. it's a great basic.",5
"I was so excited for this top! it looks exactly as pictured. material is soft albeit slightly see through but if you wear a nude bra, it's fine. i love the ruffle details and it's very comfortable. i'm 5'7"", 140 with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd chest. i bought the small and it's perfect. the medium would have been a little looser fitting with more drape but i enjoy the fitted look. don't pass this up. great price point and sure to be a staple.",5
"This is a beautiful and super soft cashmere sweater. i found it to run large, so thankfully i ordered one size down, which was perfect. i'm normally xs, but the xxs was very flattering, still loose and casual, but fitted in the waist and arms. it is longer in length and hit mid to lower hip on my petite frame. the regular was fine, but a petite would probably be great. the sleeves are nice and long and have a pretty lace stitch detail. the cowl is nice, not too overwhelming. this is so soft and",5
"I saw this in the store, it is definitely something i had passed over on line. it is so flattering on! i bought in ivory then immediately ordered the grey online!",5
"This bikini is so gorgeous and fit me like a glove. i'm a true xs, bra size 34a. i ordered the small. this was more than worth full price!",5
"I seriously love this top, and at the sale price it's a steal! i ordered the ivory color and it's just as beautiful in person as in the product photos. i thankfully read the reviews and knew that the sleeves would be slit. i think the slit sleeves add more interest to an otherwise basic blouse. it can be dressed up or down and is great for work (at least in my very casual office). the fit is perfect; i ordered my normal size medium and it's definitely true-to-size.",5
Fits perfectly! super soft and well-made! love the 3/4 sleeves and back drop. i can expect i will wear a lot in this coming fall/winter season in ca. highly recommend!,5
"I was a little hesitant to order this dress because of the a-symmetric hem. being very petite i thought it would be too bold for my small frame. i loved the colors though-- i ordered the one in red--and the the way the dress twirls and flows so i took a chance--and so glad i did!
the dress is beautiful and unusual and so very flattering. the top portion is of a heavier fabric,so no see through at all. the slanted cut of the white and tan portion is very slimming and flows beautifully into the r",5
"This dress in the blue motif has a really flattering fit and look. the dress especially in this color, hides the belly area well and does not make you look wide if you are heavier in the bottom half. it is not too short and goes past my knee. i am 5'3'.'' the material is also really soft and the dress is easy to pull on.",5
I ordered these online. i usually wear a 4-6 depending on the brand. i ordered the 6 and love the way they fit as i didn't want them tight. they have a lot of stretch and the fabric is nice quality.,5
"Love the asymmetrical zipper, style, fabric and color. so soft, comfy and warm. i got a size small and it fits perfectly and isn't tight or loose. the pockets are sewn shut but easily opened by cutting the thread with scissors. highly recommend this cute and functional jacket!",5
"I fell in love with these cropped pants & first purchased a size 31 but realized that they do run true to size so i exchanged for a 30. i usually wear an 8-10 pant size.

i am so happy with these chinos!",5
"I love this dress .
perfect fit and very good quality.",5
"I love this dress. wearing it is the equivalent as wearing your coziest t-shirt. there is stretch up top if your chest needs it, the neckline is modest, the stripes and geometric pattern are flattering and vibrant, but not gaudy in the slightest. the length is perfect with the shortest part at my knee. silhouette is tight at the natural waist and flares out in the most flowy and flattering way. i got the large. i am 5'7"" and fluctuate between 170 -185 lbs.",5
These chinos fit great! they are extremely comfortable and true to size but note that they do loosen up quite a bit with wear. i bought all 3 colors!,5
"I love lightweight coat-jackets, of which this is a great example. they effortlessly pull an outfit together and give real personality to simple staples. the unstructured linen, while indeed lined, gives this coat a casual drape for spring/summer. i see it paired with bright red joggers and a white t, with chambray or white linen pants, even as a chic beach cover-up. i un-tacked the cuffs to give the sleeves a simpler look, but it's decidedly day and casual as opposed to evening or work wear. fu",5
"I love this dress. i got the coral, and it's clean and simple, but with visually interesting lines. the top is a slightly heavier, stretchy fabric (no zippers or closures), while the skirt is made of a lighter fabric that gives it a bit of flirty swing. the hem is also slightly a-symmetrical, which i didn't notice from the online pictures. it's a very comfortable dress that i could see being very versatile - dressed up for work, dressed down for daytime weekend wear, or even for date night. (i a",5
"I had been eyeing the maroon one and i snatched it as soon as it went on sale. when i pulled it out of the package, i could not believe how soft it was. literally, as a cloud. think of the softest, fluffiest baby blanket. also, the cut is extremely flattering. i am 5'7"", 135 lb and the medium fit me perfectly, flowing, but not boxy. love it!",5
"I love this dress - design, fabric, colors
currently wear it as maternity and it's super cute but it is my size and can't wait to wear it next spring/summer as a regular dress when i can show off a more slender waist. get compliments all the time. dress up w a pair of heels for a date night or dress down w flip flops :)
the fabric on the bottom wrinkles easily when gilded so not ideal for travel but that's a minor thing",5
"I love this, despite the split sleeves. the day it arrived i paired it with a black boucle midi skirt (from retailer) jewelry and mid high black slings and we to out to dinner with friends. several people complimented me so it must have looked as i'd hoped. i have worn it one other time with straight legged pants and a cashmere cardigan and felt comfortable and a bit more dressed up than usual slacks, jeans and shirts. it is soft, feminine and comfortable...the ubiquitous ""dress it up or dress it",5
When i returned this the salesperson asked what was wrong w it bc it keeps being returned. i got the black w the white collar/cuffs. i thought it was terribly itchy material (which could be remedied w a shirt underneath) but the white collar part was such a dull ugly white-dirty color. maybe the other colors are better?,1
"I usually wear a 27 in ag and other designer jeans. i ordered a 29 based on the other reviewers. they fit like the model and look great. i might have been able to go with 28 if these end up stretching out, so i'm hoping they don't. they are nice and thick for white jeans, yet soft and comfy.",5
Just received these pants today and i absolutely love them! the material is super soft and the fit is true to size! i ordered the tan color. i really like the wide leg and the frayed bottom!! i may order the gray too!,5
"So the other review complained that there are slits on the sleeves of this blouse. yes, that is true. however, i love that about this blouse! i tried this blouse on in the store so the slits were not a surprise to me, but i can understand how they may upset a customer who wasn't expecting them. i think the slits are elegant and are in no way obtrusive or revealing. you could totally still wear this blouse to work or a nice dinner. i love it because its unique enough to be worn alone and simple i",5
"Bought this in navy. needed something comfortable, but able to dress up denim. this was perfect! wore it already and immediately got 2 complements. the only drawback was that the elastic in cuffs was a little too tight and my forearms are not large. bought in medium. i'm 5'8"" and 145 lbs. just washed it for first time. noticed that it dried a little wrinkly in front. may have to steam to get wrinkles out, but still worth it.",5
"I love this dress! i bought the blue one and i love the designs. i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult, but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant! it flows nicely and is super comfortable.",5
"I went to my local retailer store in kansas city,mo at country club plaza and let me tell you when i saw this sweater i mediately fell in love with it. i bought mine in the red color in a size medium and it fit me perfectly. i would definitely recommend getting this sweater because it's so soft and very flattering on my body type. i also love the pattern and definitely worth the money!!",5
"Okay, i am not that tall and don't have legs for miles, but i loving wearing a wide-legged cropped pant with heels for a change from the everyday. these pants are great because they are 99% cotton. the cotton is a nice weight (not too light) and the barely there fringe bottom is a nice detail. i usually wear a 28 in pilcro and that's what i bought! i would describe the color as leaning more toward khaki than green, though it did look little green under the lights in the store.",5
"This dress is so flattering and comfortable. i bought it in xs and it fits perfectly. i'm 5'7"" and weigh 135 - i usually wear a small but the small would have been too roomy on top. i got so many compliments on the dress (in blue) that i ordered it in green as well! perfect combination of comfort, style and flattering fit.",5
"I got this dress in green and it looks better in person than it even does in the online picture. the fabric is soft and flattering. i am pear shaped so a lot of things don't look good around my waist, but this worked beautifully. the only thing is that i can't get the slight wrinkles out of the bottom. i washed it and lined dried it and some still show. the care says not to iron. a steamer would probably work well on this. the slight wrinkles are not an issue for me though. well worth it and a g",5
"I love these pants, they are soft versatile and stylish! great choice!",5
This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.,1
"Pilcro has become my go to brand for pants as they always seem to fit with consistent sizing.  i'm an 8-10 and size 30 never fails to fit perfectly.  i've got hips and a booty so it's great to have a brand that works with my curves.  these chinos are super soft and feel like pants i've had for years -- broken in but still look polished.  i bought the green (which is really teal) and feel in love with them. i've since bought the gray and sand/khaki color.  i'm 5'6"" and the length hits just below",5
"Soft, lightweight, comfortable. i wore this as soon as i got it and have received many compliments on the style and color. super soft, love the angled zipper and sleeve length is long enough to be comfortable. great cool weather jacket.",5
"Very soft, cozy, and exactly what is needed on tbose in-between days. the collar is a bit dramatic if you are petite, but there is an extra button that makes it more manageable. stylish, cute",5
"I purchased the red color in august after seeing it in the store. it is cozy and stylish-love the coordinating pattern in the cowl neck. i am 5'7"" and 135 lbs and the s fit great. noticed that it is now on special promotion and would advise you purchase now! it is completely worth full price but if you can save and buy say a coordinating pilcro pant, all the better, right??",5
"I bought this dress in green and i really like it. the bodice is a substantial knit - light enough for summer but thicker and sturdier than the typical jersey tee - and the skirt is a lightweight woven fabric with good drape. true to size and extremely comfortable. it's a great work dress. the striped colorblocking is not very flattering on my frame (broad shoulders, larger chest) but it's not bad. you'll probably want to try it on in person.",5
"It's hard for me to find dresses that look good on me since i have more of a straight build and tend to carry a little extra weight in my middle. however, this dress was super flattering, giving me some curves and hiding my tummy. i got the one with the red skirt (it's definitely an orange-red) since that looked a little more polished and less casual than the green one i tried on in the store. the full, fluttery skirt is feminine and fun, and the knit top is very soft and comfortable. every sing",5
I bought this in the reddish color. i was a little skeptical that the fit or style would really work on a petite person but it looks great on. the fabric is very soft but with enough body that the cowl keeps it's shape. i predict that people will get tired of seeing me in this as i'm going to wear it a lot.,5
These pants are a great fit. perfect for the in-between seasons. casual comfortable but look very nice and polished when worn. a practical steal at retailer's sale prices.,5
"This dress is great for work and play. i bought a l and a xl. both fit well, but the sleeves in the large were quite tight. so i kept the xl although it is a bit loose. this dress looks great on. i wish the material was a little higher quality, but i loved the design and plan to wear it with boots. the top is cotton and i liked the lace up feature at the neckline.",5
Love these wide-leg chinos. they are super comfy and the fabric is incredibly soft. the size fit true for me. i would buy these again.,5
"Love everything about this dress -- i ordered the 'red' which is more of a 'red orange' / with cream and beige - as pictured, colors are beautiful. the dress has a nice 'drape' / great feel, love it !",5
"I saw this online and said to myself, next time you are in the retailer store look for this dress. i am glad i did! i bought the neutral dress (off white,tan.black) because i knew it would go with everything and most occasions. i am 5'6"", 136 pounds, the small fit me perfect! in retailer dresses i am between a small/med. the top of the dress is lined and form fitting which is a plus. the off white coored section does go across the chest so one must wear a neutral colored lined bra even though the to",5
"Hi,

like the other reviewers, i expected the price to be much higher. it is so warm, yet so flattering and cute. this will sell out, so buy now if you want it.",5
"Saw the grey one on the table at my local retailer. first thing i did was touch it to feel if it's soft and it felt like butta. surprisingly, it's a very snuggly and warm sweater despite it not being very thick. i think the grey is conservative enough for the office and it goes with pretty much everything, yet the geometric shapes make it modern and interesting looking. i hate turtleneck (choke!) and big cowl neck (reminds me of the 80's), but this is a compromise of both which is a bonus. since i",5
"Love these! the raw hem is on-trend! length is great (i'm 5'6""). material is the classic pilcro washed chinos. perfect. as with all pilcro pants, they stretch a bit. :)",5
"Purchased this sweater in an xs, grey pattern (for reference, 5'4"", small frame) and was worried it would be too overwhelming. this is not the case! the pattern is the perfect scale and the sweater hit just right. it seems to be true to size. i especially love the bracelet length turned back sleeves. it's a little pricey, but i think it will be worth it because it is so different!",5
"I got this dress in a petite xs. i'm 5'4"" and 110lbs. it fit just right. i usually wear a regularl xs in most brands, but with retailer, i noticed i always have to go to the petittes. anyway, the dress is super cute. love the diagonal striping and the draping is not too poofy which is great. the material is very lightweight on the bottom - which is good for spring/summer.",5
This sweater is gorgeous. ordered in the grey motif. was as described and wonderfully soft. i tried it on with just a tank top underneath and did not find the material scratchy at all. i ordered the small size and felt it ran a tad on the large side however not enough to feel like i needed to return for an xs. looking forward to the colder months!,5
"This is my kind of clothing item. i love linen, stripes, pockets and a loose look in an over piece. it has the lining to give a good hang to the coat. linen may not be for all but i do like the look of the fabric. i feel this is true to size giving you the loose look and not a slim fit. the sleeve length is just perfect for this look and finishes the overall style. it does not have any neck closure which may bother some. i have never purchased from this maker so took a chance in quality but am p",5
"I absolutely love this jacket! it is the softest jacket i own. the collar takes this to the next level. i wasn't sure i would like the collar but after trying it on, i love it. i'm so confused as to why the pockets are partially sewn together. it's weird but according to the other reviews, i am hoping to open the pockets up completely. i really should have gotten a medium in this coat. i am usually between a small and medium and this is a little on the smaller side. i bought this one on sale so",5
"Beautiful dress! perfect for work, the museum, a summer picnic...so chic, yet extremely comfortable. i purchased the blue/orange combo and the colors definitely pop. for reference i am 5'2, 115, and i went with the xs petite. especially reoommend for anyone with her hourglass being more full on bottom. super flattering!",5
"I am a solid 14 and the size l fit nicely. it's easy to wear. the diagonal print is quite flattering. my husband liked it. i am 5'9"" and it was a bit short, but not too short. i've not washed it yet so can't say how that will go. the fabric is knit but does not look like it will pill.",5
"The shirt is a heavier weight than how it looks on the product page which was a nice surprise. it has a boxy shape and was shorter than expected. i'm 5'7"" and the front of the shirt above the hips. the design and color is great. very happy overall.",5
"I absolutely love these shorts. i ordered a medium. i was nervous they would be too small, (my legs aren't the skinniest), but because of the slit on the side, they were fine. i do have a pretty tiny waist, and they were slightly snug but not too much to send them back. i am almost 5'7' and weight 145. i have a solid black one piece suit and they look great with it. i love the material as well, they are extremely comfortable. a little pricey, but i will definitely make use of them. i love the pr",5
"This dress is perfect for me (i'm very bohemian/rocker vs prim, & flowy vs structured). it will be in regular rotation for years. it's slim through the shoulders and arms, and flowing everywhere else. love the pockets. the fabric is light, but i love in so cal, so it's great. i'm wearing it right now with gray skinnies, heeled clogs, and a scarf. i'll also wear it all summer as a dress. so perfect. i'm 5'4, 140lb, 34b, and the 8 fits perfectly.",5
"For the price, you can't beat this dress. i love the thicker stretchy fabric used for it - if you're a fan of some of the popular maeve pencil skirts (like the tearoom pencil skirt), you will love this! for me, it's the perfect piece for work with a black or white cardi or denim jacket over it. it's a perfect length (above the knee on 5""7""...similar to the model), armholes are the right size, and the overall cut of the dress is forgiving and flattering, even post-baby. super happy with the value",5
This is awesome multi-season dress.,5
"The first thing i noticed upon receiving this dress is how soft it is and the fact that it wasn't wrinkled coming out of the packaging bag- an excellent quality! my next surprise was to find that it is fully lined with a very nice soft knit and felt awesome on. i ordered a size small and it fit perfectly- it was fitted through my waist and hips (37 chest, 28.5 waist, 37 hips) and dropped straight from my hips just like i like. i was afraid it would be too sheath like for my figure but it is perf",5
It is easily paired with a nice tip for work and feels great to wear all day,5
"I just bought the grey, and now i'm coming back for the black and cream i lovethis staple item!! so soft fits great!",5
Very unique shirt-- you will get a compliment! the material has a great feel and weight. beautiful color. it runs true to size.,5
I wore this sweater while gathering ingredients for my thanksgiving feast and 3 different women at whole foods complimented my sweater. it is soft and warm. would love in other colors too...like a mint green.,5
I bought this to wear to my winter bridal shower. it was a cold day so i turned it into a jumper by pairing it with a silk blouse. it is flattering and comfortable. great for work and other semi-formal events.,5
This tank is super soft and very well fitted. it fits true to size. the lace is so pretty in front but what makes this unique is the lace on the back of the top. it is a unique design and good quality!,5
I think this dress is adorable . it fits great. wear it with heels or cowboy boots. you will not be disappointed,5
"I agree with the other reviewer, this skirt is has beautiful print combed cotton with a sheen. it is kind of stiff with a little give, a perfect a line. the waist is a little tight so i sized up, usually wear a 2 and the 4 was perfect for me. wore it to a show last night and was super comfortable and pretty all in one.",5
This is adorable but if it truly has to be dry-cleaned that is deal killer,1
"I love the style of this dress, comfortable but chic, and it feels great!",5
"I ordered a size small. i am 5'7"" size 6 and the dress was a mini on me! way shorter than on the taller model. the stomach and hips gaped out from my body yet the waist was cut way too high, so the dress was both too small and too big! very odd fit. the material is soft, thick, stretchy and has a textured pattern which i liked. this one is going back.",1
"This blazer is beautiful. it runs tts. it is lightly lined with an off-white poplin. in the body of the jacket, the off-white lining is an adorable swiss dot. though the lining makes the lace portions of the jacket not completely see through, a darker shirt would still show through. the detail is amazing - from the adorable buttons to the variations in the fabric texture. i am 5'5"", and the fit (as far as length) is very similar to what is shown on the model. the sleeves are a little on the long",5
Heavier fabric than it looks but cute and versatile. flattering as well!,5
"I love this duster! i got my usual size and it fits exactly as pictured. the color of the fabric is a perfect neutral and will look good with anything. the knit is open and fairly see-through, this avoids the bathrobe look that a long length sweater can have. bought at full price and i'm not sorry because i bet it will be gone before long!",5
"This dress is perfection! great, quality fabric. bright vibrant color. the design and texture allow it to be dressed up or dressed down. i sized up a size because my normal wasn't available and it fits perfectly!",5
"These are my favorite tights. i love how they are opaque. i love that they are thick but not so thick as to be only appropriate for winter. they are slimming without feeling too tight.

why don""t you sell these any more??? please bring them back!",5
"I initially worried about these because i am curvy on the bottom and short (5'3), but they balance me out perfectly. they are light and airy and perfect for summer. i have paired them with form fitting tops which work best considering the bottom volume., and my latigo clogs which give me some height. these are my new favorite go-to pants!",5
"I am not sure why this is listed on the website at hd in paris, because i purchased this shirt in carmel, ca and it is actually maeve, which is a brand i buy often and always fits me well. this piece did not disappoint. this is a fun and versatile black top, but has a little edge with its design and i know that i will get a lot of use out of it. i don't find the fabric to be ""rough"" at all, but it is textured which i just think adds to the interest of this piece. i am a 34d and did not find my c",5
"I've been looking for the right red dress for a while and this one is a winner! flattering fit, comfy quality fabric...makes me feel great even right after having a baby. fits tts and i can't wait to rock this beauty!",5
"These are fab as always with pure good printed leggings. bright, beautiful print, great quality fabric, and flattering. goes with lots of color tops too! took my usual size s (4/27 in bottoms) and found them perfect.",5
"I love these tights! i stock up every year. they are a great quality, not too thick to be hot, but not too thin that they are sheer when you put them on. they also don't squeeze you at the waistline. favorite tights.",5
"Love this dress. it is so comfortable. it fits great and can be dressed up or down. hides the tummy, too.",5
"I bought this tunic today because it paired well with patterned slim pants. at 5'2"" the tunic felt like it added height and even though i'm a 34f the top fit well across the bust. i tried on the large first, and it felt very comfortable but a bit big. the medium fit a little more snugly, but was more proportional in the arms, so i purchased it instead.
the neckline is not too low and does not require a camisole under and the buttons add a nice weight so that the top drapes towards my chest inst",5
"I saw this today and decided to try it on, it fit perfectly! i have a generous bosom 36e, and a large fit without gaping or the button issues a previous reviewer noted. the fabric is comfortable, no itching. too bad it's 90 degrees, i'm ready to wear this.",5
The raspberry color is really stunning! i have been looking for colored tights for a while and had difficulty finding really rich colors. i was thrilled when i saw these! i've worn them once so far. very comfortable and seem like they will last.,5
"Love the bright red color. such a comfortable fit, but still feminine and pretty. could be dressed up or down. will definitely be a summer favorite.",5
Tried this soft yummy jumpsuit on and loved the flow and softness of the fabric ...... will be able to wear into the fall with oversized sweater or wrap. just love,5
I loved this tunic. dress up or down layer it with a cropped leather jacket and booties. i bit on the long side so if you are short it might make you look stumpy but really cute with leggings or skinny jeans.,5
These are the perfect tights-fit and feel are top quality and they wash well!,5
"I own a couple of pairs of natori hipsters and recently purchased the yellow to go with the front close natori bra. i tried to wear thong panties but they just didn't work for me. thankfully, natori makes these lovely panties that still make me feel sexy and they are way more comfortable. they also receive rave reviews from my husband. : )",5
"I love this tunic! it has an unusual neckline with decorative stitching and beautiful buttons,.i like the slight sheen of the fabric as well. wearing it makes me feel elegant without sacrificing comfort. i'm going to wear it for work with black leggings and on weekends with jeans; i suspect it will also be great to travel in. the only potential downsides might be the deep side slit and the fact that it has to be dry cleaned.",5
"What?! i can't believe this got so many mixed reviews! i wasn't sure what to expect and now that i've received it, i think it's absolutely perfect. it's flattering, the length is great, it's tts, and the color is beautiful. i have no issues with the skirt whatsoever either.  i'm really pleased with this purchase and i can't wait to wear it.",5
"This wide leg pant gives the perception of a skirt that is feminine, comfortable, and moves beautifully when you walk. can be used all year round!",5
"This coat is beautifully tailored and made in the usa of 100% wool the color is vibrant. it looks great when you need a longer coat for the cold. it's almost an outfit on its own. lastly, the size was perfect. i ordered my normal 8 and it fit like a glove.",5
"I have worn these exclusively for the past couple of years. they fit great (tts), stay put, and wear very well. these are well worth the price.",5
Cute little sleep mask! the elastic band is wide so it doesn't ever feel like it's digging into your head. does a very good job keeping out light.,5
Great tights with good color and quality. i got a lot of compliments on my head to toe retailer ensemble!,5
These jeans are soooo soft. fit is great and the wash is a unique inky grayish color. perfect for fall. love.,5
"Love this! i am 5' 118 and the medium fits like a dress, not a tunic. i opted for the medium because i didn't want the fit to be tight. it is thin so you'll need a slip.",5
"This is the jacket i've been looking for! i love the collar/lapels - they can lay flat or be worn up a bit. the material is really soft so the jacket is comfy and soft. the sleeves are of a ribbed material that makes the jacket even softer and more comfy. i got the black but it's really more of a charcoal black vs. jet black. the color/dye is saturated and dense so there is no sheen to the material ensures that it will be colorfast. when zipped it's form fitting but not tight (tts - i'm 120 lbs,",5
I really like the skirt! it's very comfortable and i can wear it with  so many colors.,5
"I have had a problem finding jeans that fit properly (that i don't have to pull up every single time i walk up the stairs or stand up) but these are perfect. they are made with a bit of a stretchy material, yet keep their shape well. i am 5'7, 130 pounds, athletic body type and got a size 25. the only thing i am worried about is the dark color bleeding onto a light colored couch/quilt/purse/etc. as this has happened to me before with dark wash jeans.",5
"I love pilcro script jeans. the rise is super comfortable and the fabric stretch is perfectly flattering without being too tight. the wash is great. from the pictures, i didn't realize this pair had the fringed bottom rather than the hem, but they cuff easily if you want to hide it. plus, with boot season approaching, i think it will make boots more comfortable without the bulky hem. i wish they would make this cut with all of their products - would love to see a pair of cords or dress pants!",5
I loved this skirt. they didn't have my size anymore so i tried on a few others. i really needed a small p. otherwise i totally would have kept it!,5
"Ordered this in my typical size, xs, and it fits perfectly. the weather hasn?t cooled off enough for me to wear it on a daily basis, but after just trying it on i can say that it fits really nice. the sleeves are a knit material which make them very forgiving and the jacket easy to wear. plus, there is enough room for me to wear a tee-shirt or thin blouse underneath. ordered the slate color and it is a very beautiful neutral, brown that should go with almost anything.",5
"This says online only, hwoever the balc one was in my store (and some other colros too). anyway, i actually liked this top, it is more flattering than the model shows, i think i could wear this with pants or legginss in botos. on me, the regualr size is almost a dress (should i be younger), but i do like that (i did debate ordering petite, and decided not to). it is thin enough to not be too hot indoors, and sublte stripes on the black version.

This price is amazing and goes with everything! fits great! so glad i made this purchase.,5
"Pretty and comfortable fun cardi for those of us who love a nice little cropped number. glad to report that this cobalt beauty fits true to size in an xs all over -- shoulders hit at a nice place, arms, waist, length is great above your waist or just at it. the cotton is ultra comfortable. the zipper has that luxurious feature of a double zip where you can zip from the bottom or the top once closed, creating a nice opening. i love this for a casual but chic holiday look thanks to the velvet ador",5
"Great light-weight blouse for mild fall days. fabric is thin so not too warm, which is great for southern california fall. great color palate.",5
"Cute casual skirt, i love that it is longer in the back than the front so i can comfortably wear it to work.  i had to size up, which i usually do in bottoms that do not have stretch because i'm my athletic frame.",5

"I have the marrakech vest from the summer and really liked the quality and fit of that, so i ordered this one. fit is very similar. this one is made of a lightweight cotton, and has a similar cut. will be a great fall transitional jacket, and looks great with lots of things--maxi skirts, skinny jeans, long tops with the hems peaking out, etc. i found it tts: i got an xs and am 5'4"", 120 lbs. i don't plan to wear more than a thin top underneath, but don't think i could fit a sweater under the sle",5
"I bought these in the store yesterday and am thrilled with them.

sizing: they run large. i am glad i bought them in store because i was planning to buy the 28s and the 26s fit instead. for reference, i am 5'4"", athletic, postpartum, 135 pounds. 

fit: inseam is very long. waist is a flattering v-shape, versus straight across the midline. i find these a little lower rise than i'd ideally choose--they hit around 2 inches below my navel. the back pockets are small and high. i find the butt are",5
"This is a throw it on and you're cute.  so easy and comfy, requires barely any styling to look cute in this.  and it has pockets!",5
"This is a pretty blouse that is also very comfortable. i am always an xl in retailer tops, but i needed to go down to a large on this one. this blouse is cut generously everywhere, but going down one size was perfect for me. the fabric in the back falls from the shoulder blade area, so it has a very nice drape in the back. the sleeve cuffs and placket are some sort of cotton, so the cuff made a nice base to fold the sleeve around and up to the elbow. i wore a nude bra underneath, and i can't see m",5
"Was excited to receive this top in the mail, and wasn't disappointed when i tried it on. beautiful colors (true to image) and pattern -the blue back does extend into the front, but does not look unflattering in the least or leave for an awkward fit, imho. very happy with this top, it looks so cute from the back, too~",5
This shirt is a simple but versatile top. it goes anywhere with anything so it's a great travel piece. i'm curvy on top but short waisted and this shirt does a good job of disguising that figure flaw. i got loads of compliments from men who liked the femininity that stops short of 'sugary' as one guy put it. it's quite comfortable and doesn't bunch up when one sits down. i wore it with copper jewelry and that really made it 'pop.' a great piece for one's wardrobe.,5
I've been looking for a more polished edgy alternative to my jean jacket and this is perfect! it's super soft and comfortable. will look awesome over a dress or with jeans. love it!,5
"This top is even better than pictured. the colors are brighter, though still natural. this allows lots of possibilities with pairing bottoms to it. i ordered a large (my usual size) and would say it's pretty loose, but doesn't look ridiculous. it just hangs well and fits the way it should. the fabric is a little thin so you'll need a shade shirt or tank under it if you don't want your bra to show through.",5
"This top is simple but beautiful. i am either a large or xl but purchased this in the xl. it is a swing top, but has a beautiful flow to it which is not overbearing. i am around 5'6"" and slightly on the broad side and do not feel overpowered by this shirt at all.
i love a top that can be worn everyday with a pair of jeans or dressed up with a pair of slacks. the plus to this top is that it can born worn almost year round which i like.
a great staple for your closet.",5
"This skirt is fabulous!!! i ordered it in both grey and green. only flaw was the grey one was 2 inches shorter all the way around (made it too short!!!), so i kept the green. great for summer and maybe fall with flats and a jacket.",5
"This skirt is soft and comfortable, breathes and moves really nicely. great quality and fabric, just be careful in the first wear i snagged a spot with my rings. i ordered my usual medium, but probably could have sized down to a small. i plan to wear this all the time.",5
"This is a great jacket for fall layering. love the color and cut. it wasn't appearing to me in the photo that the sleeves were knit, but it actually works. i wear the sleeves pushed up as i have really long arms and they are a smidge short. now my go too for casual work days and weekend wear.",5
This jacket is surprisingly soft and comfy. i'd been debating getting a leather jacket in this style but when i saw this it seemed a great option. seems to be very versatile.,5
I've been searching for a brown top/dress/tunic forever and i finally found the perfect one!! i stumbled across this adorable tunic while browsing the clearance room at my local retailer and you can imagine my excitement when it was my size (small). i tried it on and almost asked to wear it out of the store. it's sooo soft and has a beautiful rib-like pattern/texture to it. you could wear it as a top with pants or a dress with tights/leggings.,5
"These make your rear look ah-maz-ing!!! i mean, seriously good. every time i wear these, my husband cannot keep his hands off. usually, i'm 27/28, in these i took a 29. perfection. i also got them in the black and blue washes. i may not be wearing any of my other jeans at this point. so good. awesome price point too.",5
I am amazed this is still on sale. it's so comfortable and fabulous!!,5
Love this denim and particular wash. button fly will last forever. looks so cute rolled a little on the cuff.,5
Love this dress! really comfortable and flattering. the arm holes are a little big but not too much for me to return the dress or not wear it. love it!,5
A great little dress that can be dressed up or down.,5
"I can't think of many things more comfortable than cloth & stone's fabric, so when i saw this jumpsuit i had to try it. it is a nice mid-weight perfect for fall weather or a mild winter like we are currently having in the northeast! looks very cute with a duster cardigan over it. fits true to size (meant to fit a little loosely). length is great everywhere on my 5'7"" frame. feels like wearing pajamas, with the benefit of looking put-together!",5
"I thought these were gorgeous and was going to buy them although the price was a bit high. in fact, two separate women came up to me as i was walking around the store and asked where i got the pants because the colors are so vivid. however, as we were looking at the items, we noticed that both the green and the blue both had several small holes in them due to stitching quality, as the previous reviewer noted. therefore, none of us purchased the pants.

the staff at the store were very helpful",1
"Dress fits perfectly and is extremely comfortable. great for day or evening. love it!,",5
I got this because it was on sale and it looked like a fun design.  i like it so much more than i expected to!  the material drapes beautifully so the lower parts skims my body while the upper part moves nicely but doesn&amp;amp;amp;amp;#39;t stick out too much.  i love the green color too!  i tie the ties on the back of the dress--at the level of my shoulder blades--rather than on top as in the photo.  i think it looks cuter that way.  so glad i took a chance on it!,5
Gave this sweater to my mom this christmas and she has hardly taken it off...so cozy and cute!,5
"I have seen this dress for a while and was holding off, but then i decided to try it on (the regualar) size in store to keep in mind for my next binge :-).

the cut is flattering, length is jsut above my knee so i would not get the petite on this one. i would, as others have mentioend, wear it with a belt. overall it fits like a nice comfy t-shirt with comfy skirt, but as a dress, very nice.",5
This dress is so cute and so comfortable. i will be wearing this to a lot of different kind of events. i am so happy with this purchase.,5
"This is the most comfortable dress ever! it's so soft. i typically wear a size small and this fits true to size. it is long enough to wear to work, which i love. it looks great w flats in the summer and it's going to look great w boots!",5
Like these pants and they were on sale--does not get better!,5
"I meant to order this online and forgot. i was very happy when i was able to get it in one of the stores yesterday. it's everything a summer dress should be: flowy, lightweight and a great print. i can't believe there's no reviews and that it still available in every size. for reference i got a small i am 5'4""  135. this dress i thought would make me look wide because it's all straight across but in fact it really has a great flow and is cut well. grab it while you can.",5
Cute and comfy. looks like i will be able to dress up a bit too. fabric and fit are great!,5
What a great find! this is so easy to dress up or down and a very comfortable fit and fabric. the skirt fabric is pretty form fitting so not something i can comfortably wear to work but it's a versatile piece otherwise. the buttons on the sleeve are a nice touch.,5
"At 5'3"" and 155 pounds with a short waist, it's hard to find attractive jeans. hit the jackpot with these. they're comfortable, very slimming with a perfect rise and length. i ordered size 32 so i did go up a size. love the button closure instead of a zipper. these are much better than my citizen boyfriends that cost twice as much. try these, you won't be disappointed!",5
"Don't think the photo does this skirt justice. it's a very flattering fit, the kind of skirt you'll wear all summer!",5
These are great for lounging around or even wearing to work as they can be dressed up or down.,5
"If any of you have read the book or watched the movie ""sisterhood of the traveling pants"" then you will understand this analogy. i am convinced that this dress hugs everyone in the right places. it looks kind of boring on a hanger, but has an incredible fit that complimented my waist so much. i instantly felt tinier in every trouble area of my body. although the design of this dress is casual, i feel that it can easily be dressed up for a nice brunch or meeting. i love basic clothing designs tha",5
"Very comfortable dress for fall and early winter. love the material and great to throw on to run errands in over the weekend, or could dress up with flats and sweater for work.",5
These pants are perfect for any closet! they can be casual weekend or paired with a light top and heels. very comfortable. love the detailing around the pockets.,5
"It's definitely not a $100  blouse, but i took advantage of the sale on sale and gotta say i love it! it's slightly sheer, but with a plain nude bra it's fine. beautiful details, very retro, light and breezy. wearing it to work and with jeans.",5
This cardigan is defined by comfort. it is of a lovely knitted like material and is very warm. the pockets are great for holding your phone and the billowy sleeves make you feel like you are wrapped in a blanket.,5
"When i saw this online, it looked like a regular cardigan with a hood, but with looser arms and a generally looser fit. just be aware it has bat wings or something (not sure what it is called). there isn't one picture included with an arm lifted, so without a really close look, the arms look loose, but normal. i returned it :(",5
"I love how comfortable this dress is! i ordered an xs and it fit perfectly (i'm 5' 4"" and it falls to just above my knee). it holds its shape and is very flattering. pair it with a cute denim jacket and ankle boots for fall, or a light scarf and ballet flats for spring!",5
"Seriously, most comfortable pants ever!!! fabric feels very luxe. are they dressy enough for the office? i don't care, they feel that great.",5
"Really cute everyday dress. love the fabric and material, it's super soft. a great dress to just throw on and go.",5
I may wear these every day! i am obsessed. i am 5'8 125ibs normally a size 25/26 in jeans. i ordered these in a 26 and they fit like a glove! they do not stretch much at all and keep a really nice vintage fit and feel. i am extremely happy with this purchase. these are a must have staple in anyone's wardrobe.,5
"This ""little"" dress is extremely cute and very comfortable. i didn't pay enough attention to the picture and totally missed the faux wrap skirt, but that only adds to the appeal, and is well done, not showing too much skin. this dress looks great with a white denim jacket or a red cardi. it will get lots of use and really is a 3 quarters of the year piece.",5
"This dress is so pretty, comfortable and easy to wear. i got so many compliments in it. it is a winner for sure!",5
Love this top!,5
"Soft, comfortable, flattering - great for spring, summer, fall, and wear a tight black long-sleeved tee underneath for winter! not form-fitting, even if you size down.",5
"Very nice but thin materal. very sheer. i paired with the palmarosa wide legs. loved the way it looked. i do think the sale price is a bit high for this shirt, though.",5
"I tried this on in the store and was sad that the small was a little unflattering around my mid section.  couldn't stop thinking about the dress though, so checked reviews online from home...many said to size up. i ordered a medium and it is perfect! fits so nicely now and the fabric is so cozy!! i thought the top would be too big in a larger size but it still looks good.",5
"I really love cloth & stone, and this top did not disappoint. i am usually a size small in tops but tend to be an xs in halters because the arm holes are usually big on me. i went with my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it has a nice drape to it and is super soft. i will add that when looking at the picture, i didn't notice that there is a muted pink to the plaid design. i originally thought it was just a navy blue and white plaid. however, there is a really light pink to it as well. i actually w",5
Wonderful dress! very comfortable and great fit! received numerous compliments whenever i wear it.,5
"This dress is so soft and comfortable. great winter staple. i purchased the blue motif, which really doesn't have any blue on it. the stripes are fun and make this the perfect dress to throw on and feel great while staying comfortable.",5
I ordered this dress in the green color. the dress did not look like the picture. i returned the dress since it looked like something to wear to a farm barnyard dance. i returned the dress.,1
I love this dress! i generally wear size 10 and the medium fits perfect. i'm a curvy lady and this dress fits great. i've received many compliments on it and might even get another pattern because i love it so much!,5
"I wanted to love this dress..and it did not disappoint! true to size, not too snug but doesn't make you look shapeless. the material is soft and has great movement. looks great with boots and booties. i know i will be wearing this one often!",5
"Casual comfort with style! fabric is a dream to wear and it flows nicely. not exactly form-fitting, but still flattering. i'm 5'9, 140, and wore the medium.",5
The fabric is super soft and litght. it hardly feels like you are wearing it. body skimming fit can disguise a less than perfect figure. can easily go from day to night. absolutely love.,5
"I didn't think i'd like this due to the high neck, but i was in the store and it was so soft that i tried it on in the black motif. this dress is so comfortable and flattering. it's definitely a versatile piece: dress down with a denim jacket or dress up with heels. and it has pockets!",5
"Tried this dress on at my local retailer and just fell in love with it. it is a sleek, almost '90's style design that is so comfortable and flattering at the same time. and it has pockets! i will be wearing it all summer with flats or sneakers.",5
"I bought the multi-color stripe and it is adorable! i am 5'9"", 135 lbs and purchased a size small. it is a perfect length and drapes well...not too tight at all. i received a ton of compliments the first time i wore it. highly recommend!",5
I took a chance buying online. i'm thrilled this dress clings at the top and releases where it should (below the bust) without looking like a tent. a very classy dress for work or play. just hope it holds up after a wash as the material is thin (but opaque). love this dress.,5
"I always wear dresses because fl is hot. this one is easy breezy and fun. it's trendy without trying too hard. nice lines, the fabric is nice and soft and washes well. the pattern is pretty, i got both colors. i always get compliments when i wear this dress.",5
"I loved this dress. it runs small (i'm normally a 2) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room, the zippers got stuck a lot. i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in. finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well. 

i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding. my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up... and then it broke. the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go. it was awful. i co",1
"The price is amazing for this easy and flattering dress. looks great as is or with a scarf, sweater, jacket, you name it! i just couldn't resist getting carried away with this one..",5
"I love this dress so much. it is more comfortable than any of my pajamas and the best part is it is very work appropriate, especially paired with chambray shirt buttoned and then tied at the waist.",5
"Outstanding dress. looks like a class that i will wear for many events to come. i couldn't decide which color way i liked in this dress----the red/white or the green, so i purchased both. i can see myself wearing the red into early fall and the green is a very springtime/summer dress. yes, the cut runs small but i don't think it is as small as some of the other reviews. i typically wear i size 6, and this one the 8 fit perfectly, so maybe one size up.",5
"Great dress - the hardest part was picking which color. the dress is a slim swing silhouette and very flattering. the fabric skims the body without highlighting my problem areas (lower abdomen and hips). the dress is modest enough for work (it ends a few inches above the knee in the middle, comes to my knee on the sides). i am always a xs or s in maeve - i went with the small on this dress. the sleeves aren't as long as the picture shows - they ended where they should. i went with the navy and w",5
"I fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on. it doesn't look nearly as good on the hanger, so definitely worth trying on. the fabric is high quality and super comfy; the fit is very flattering. i am curvy, 5'7"" and got the navy stripe print in size small. it's very forgiving, fitted without clinging to any ""problem"" areas. i also love how versatile it is--you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models, or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings. love it!",5
"I saw this online and wasnt sure and actually walked right past it in the store. but my usual stylist walked around the store with me and insisted it was a goodone. she usually knows what she is talking about... super soft nd comfortable, love the long sleeves (it has hidden buttons), cut is flattering on everyone. i ended up ordering petite size. turtleneck is not too tight, and the dress can pretty mjuch be dressed up or down. my friend also bought it (huhm twinsies)!! my favorite design was t",5
"Great, stylish, swinging dress. softly draped fabric, so comfy to wear....very slimming and figure flattering.",5
"I love this dress (i bought the navy with white stripes). it is comfortable, flattering, and versatile. best of all, i received a complement from my husband, who never comments on my clothing! the drapey knit fabric fits closely (but not tightly) in the shoulders and bust and then skims over the lower body. the fabric is soft and stretchy, not too thick, but still substantial enough that i did not need to wear support garments underneath (i am 5'4"", 123 lbs). i wore this to a christmas party and",5
"Love this dress - ""swingy"" is definitely the right descriptor. as someone with a large chest i was worried it would be boxy and make me look larger, but the cut is flattering even if it is on the loose size. it runs slightly large so if you're between sizes i would size down.",5
"I bought this online so didn't realize that the fabric at the bottom is very, very stiff. i was expecting something silky, or at least on the softer and more moveable side. the best description i can think of is an overly starched mens dress shirt. that being the case, it kind of juts out in weird places. the sweater part is very nice, but it is somewhat closer fitting than what it seems in the picture. the fabric bottom is too ample for the slimmer design of the sweater which just adds to the o",1
"This dress is completely versatile and great to wear as is or add a vest or chunky sweater for a layer. i bought it late last week and love the fit and comfort of the jersey knit fabric. also, you can't beat the price for an retailer dress!",5
"My conscience screamed at me not to buy this sweater and i wish i had listened! i noted the fact that it was acrylic and also the fact that it was oversized. but i also loved the design and can't resist anything with mustard yellow. i was instantly disappointed when i received it, almost didn't even try it on. how can they possibly charge $185 for terrible itchy 80's acrylic? it looks cheap, it feels cheap and it didn't even fit well. only redeeming quality: easily returnable!",1
"I love this dress! the design is simple, colors and patterns are eye-catching but not over the top. cutting is perfect for me and very flattering. the material is flowy not clingy. it is a piece of easy, no-hassle garment that i would love to wear everyday and make it my uniform. seriously, it doesn't get better than that. if they make more of this style with different colors and patterns, i will just buy them blindly.

a word of caution: the dress does have slightly bigger armholes so some pe",5
"I originally bought this dress in navy and i absolutely loved it! so i bought a second one in the neutral color. they both fit perfectly and are very flattering! i love how i can dress them up or down. i wear them out to run errands and look cute while being comfy. i also wear them to work! i am an np so business casual is a requirement for office days. when i'm used to wearing scrubs, i hate wearing true dress clothes. these dresses are a happy medium. i only wish my size was available in the t",5
"This dress is super comfy and really cute! i was worried that the horizontal stripes might not be flattering, but they didn't make me look larger at all. it's great for casual wear, but can easily be dressed up with a jacket and booties.",5
"This dress is absolutely flattering and will make you feel beautiful. fabric is thin but can easily be transitioned from fall to winter to spring. hugs all the right places. true to size. i am 5'2 and 120lbs, curvy and the small fit well. i am so happy with this purchase. great price point as well",5
"Just got this dress in the orange print and i can't begin to say how much i love it!! looks even better in person than online and it's super flattering. love the neckline, armholes are perfect and show off toned arms and shoulders ( this is the kind of dress that makes time spent at the gym worthwhile!). the fabric is light and stretchy and the pockets are an extra bonus.
i would say fit is tts but keep in mind that it's very loose at the bottom so i would go down in size if you want a less loo",5
"Love this dress! purchased it online, the xl sizes can be difficult to find in the store. dress is very cute on and you don't need to be reed thin like the model. it flatters the figure and yes, i wore spank with it. the length is good, the design (black and neutral) is flattering. i chose this to wear to my husband's christmas office party (his new job)! you know first impressions; i did not want to be over dressed. i wore my antho black boots which lace in back and go over the knee- (slouch a",5
"This dress is super comfortable and flattering.  i went with the stripes (and the p to shorten the length) -- it looks amazing with otk boots.  however, the material isn't very thick; it's more of a fall/spring dress than a winter.  i'm a xs-s p in retailer dresses - i went with the small.  xs would've fit but less flatteringly",5
The sleeves are fitted which i love. works with a belt or without.,5
"I read the rave reviews, but tried this on with low expectations. i am curvier on top so i thought the dress would make my chest look huge and show my tummy budges. the dress was the exact opposite - so flattering and a piece i could truly dress up or down. i am 5'6"", 135lbs and a small fit perfectly. i rarely purchase anything at full price but plan to circle back to my local retailer to pick this up today.",5
"Loved this dress when i tried it on in the store and thought it would be perfect for a casual wedding. unfortunately, the day of the wedding the zipper split and i had to wear something else. it fit well, but was poorly made. based off other reviews, this isn't the first time this has happened with this dress! not worth the risk at all.",1
"This dress is comfortable, hugs and skims at all the right places, and sports a perfect length for a shortie like me. wish the other patterns weren't sold out.",5
"Love everything about this dress...cut, color, material and price!",5
This dress has style and a delicate balance between design and the beauty of the material.,5
"The fabric feels and hangs nicely. it's very versatile, you can dress up or down. i purchased the navy stripe one and wear with brown boots. thinking i might need one of the other two as well, perfect for texas winters!!",5
"Super cute, flowy, and flattering. i would buy again in a heartbeat.",5
"I finally pressed 'go' on the orange dress during the weekend sale. the dress is terrific. i am a busty (36dd) size 8/10 and the m fits perfectly. based on the reviews, i had planned to take this to the tailor to take in the armholes, but it is not necessary at all - no bra showing in front or back. i am 5'6"" and the shortest part of the hem is about 2"" above my knee. there is no lining, so i might add a short pull-on slip depending on where i wear it, but otherwise this is an easy dress to be w",5
This dress is so beautiful on. purchased in black motif and it can definitely be dressed up or down. material is lightweight (perfect for summer) and the dress washed up beautifully in the washing machine. i always wear an xs in maeve and the dress fits true to size.,5
"I had to order this dress in three different sizes to get it right. i'm 5'6"" and 125, but have a petite frame with curves, so i ordered the small petite; the sleeves and length were too short. then i tried the small regular, and i swam in that one; way too much fabric. the i tried the xs and it fit perfectly. it does stretch around the bust line, so wearing a red bra would look tacky as you can see through the lighter fabric, but black or nude is fine, or even a slip or a tank would cure that is",5
"I bought this dress for an all white event. i had many compliments but it was the most fun dancing dress because the top layer spins out! it is loose and flowy but the arm holes are rather large and sizing down might have been better. i am 5'8"" and athletic and ordered a m and if i had time might have exchanged for a s. you must steam out creases before wearing.",5
"This is the softest most comfortable dress ever. i bought a large because it was the only one in stock at the store. i'm 5'9, 135 and it's a little loose but still flattering and comfortable due to my height. if you are tall you will not be disappointed w this dress!",5
Finally a dress that is not too short! i'm 5'11 and ordered two sizes. the small was too short and a little snug for my liking. but the medium was a perfect fit.,5
"I got so many compliments from friends, i bought another one in different print. packs and travels well. i'm 5'6"" and a heathy 160 lbs, carry my weight in the middle. this dress is very flattering and fabric feels like pj's. also east to wear with regular undies and racer back bra. living in a warm humid climate, it's my new go to dress. the fabric is so stretchy that i found the medium a better fit instead of my usual large.",5
"This will be a great go to piece with leggings and boots for winter and to transition into spring with wedges. i purchased the blue stripe and the multi stripe with the intention of returning one but i liked them enough to keep both. the quality of material is great and super soft and i love the little snap detail on the sleeves. i am 5' 7"", and most always wear a size medium and it fit perfect. the dress hit right above the knee but not too high so i can wear the dresses with or without tights.",5
"I got this in black with white dots. fits great, flattering and helps hide middle section.",5
"Tried and bought this in the store! loved it. my normal size 4 worked great. little word to the wise, be careful zipping it up, which is a little tricky. the first one i grabbed had a broken zipper. just takes a little work getting it up bc the fabric is thicker.",5
"Love this dress! i bought the blue motif. which barely has any blue at all. it is the softest cotton dress i own. i wore it with my red hunter boots today and it made for the best rainy day ensemble. love, love! and i got it on sale which just sweetens the deal :)",5
"If you want it, buy it now. this dress is everything and then some. love it. i bought two, the neutral (black) and the turquoise. the turquoise one is a very retro print, i am getting many compliments. they are so comfortable and flattering. i'm all about this price point retailer. more please!",5
Absolutely love this dress! so cute with booties and a jean jacket. will be a great staple for spring and fall,5
As usual this dress does not disappoint. looks great with boots and is the perfect day to date dress.,5
"Gorgeous, color, fabric, and cut. i ordered the blue in a 14. i always wear a 14p or large petite in retailer. i purchased a regular 14. it's a full size too small in the ribcage. cannot zip it up.. i'll be exchanging mine for next size up. even though i'm 4'11"", the length is fine. if you're tall, it might be pretty short for you.",5
"Very comfortable and stylish. can wear with tights, as a dress, or over jeans. cute any way! the material is not super thick, but not too thin.",5
"I bought the dress in navy stripe in december and it became a favorite, so i jumped at the opportunity to buy the ""blue"" (pink/purple/blue/black stripes) when it went on sale. this dress is very flattering and feminine, i love the fitted top, fitted sleeves with a cute button detail, and the asymmetrical hemline. i use the navy for work, whereas the colorful stripey one is fun on the weekends. it washes well and holds shape (i hang it to dry). i like it best with boots, but it would work with fl",5
"I have never purchased this brand before at retailer and there were no reviews on it when i purchased it.  i bought my usual size medium and it fit perfectly!  i am 5'2"", 120# with broad shoulders.  loved the fringe on the top and i think it will be very versatile . . .jeans/boots, skirts/heels.   definitely a keeper!  as a petite gal, this was not overly long.  if you have larger hips, this will not hang well.",5
"This dress is super cute and has the most striking color (i got the blue). i just love it. it's comfortable and flattering and hits me in all the right places. i am a petite girl and normally wear a 0 or 2 in retailer dresses, and, as the other reviewers mentioned, this runs small, so a 4 was what i needed, and even the 4 does not leave any wiggle room. that said, i like my dresses to fit sort of snugly so it works for me. i highly recommend it overall - the quality, cut, color, and comfort all ma",5
"Love this dress! i can't say enough about it. comfortable, stylish, packable! doesn't wrinkle at all. i love it. i bought the neutral and the turquoise. only planned on keeping one but i love it so much i'm keeping both. good dress for fall/winter to wear with flats or tights and boots. can easily be dressed up or worn casual. i am 5'1"" 115 lbs and bought the xs petite. perfect fit. a great price point especially with the 25% off dresses.",5
"Read other reviews, was worried about neckline being tight-- went with size of last dress i bought from retailer ---s---, perfect!! can't wait to wear this dress! got it in the black white polka dot-- plan to layer with capri legging!",5
I absolutely love this dress. it's great quality and fits perfectly.,5
"Once again, retailer delivers a beautiful, quality dress. i love it! it is comfortable and flattering. the material is light-weight enough that i will be able to wear into spring.",5
"I have been eyeing these jeans for a while but was hesitant because of the price and also because i'm short waisted so don't normally like high rise pants. i finally pulled the plug when i had a 15% off code (still expensive imo). i am so glad i finally bought them - they are well worth the price! i am 5'6"" with longer legs and i agree with the other reviewers that these run a little longer than one might anticipate. they hit about 2 inches above my ankle bone, which suits me just fine. they are",5
I bought the orange color and the pattern is absolutely beautiful. the fabric and style is very flattering and comfortable. well worth it. runs true to size (i am usually an xsmall 134 lbs 34 c and the xsmall fit perfect). perfect summer dress: soft fabric and light.,5
"Totally agree with the other reviewer!  just got this in the mail today and it is a beautiful dress but it does run one size too small.  i am always a size 8 in maeve but couldn't zip this one up!  and at 5""7' it is a tad short but i'm exchanging it for the 10 in the hope that in the next size it will be a bit longer--and that it will fit!  but it is a super flattering fit!!  and the blue color pops! a stunning dress and love that it's machine washable!",5
Love this dress in the orange print! i do agree with one reviewer who said the high neck is bothersome--it is! but i'm willing to overlook that because it is the style of this dress. and it is adorable! easy and comfortable to wear--and i just love the orange pattern print! took my usual size!,5
I love this dress. the quality of the material is very nice - good weight and softness. the dress hides my baby belly and feels really comfortable on. i got tons of compliments when i wore it!,5
"I am 5'1"", 32-26-36 and 115 lbs and got the xsp in the neutral motif at a great price. shipping was quick as well (2 business days). the dotted swirly lines are more beige than they appear on the model. great shape and easy jersey silhouette that will be flattering on all body shapes! will look great with a long statement necklace.",5
Lovely dress in bright teal color. the zipper was a bit sticky as the other reviewers had mentioned. unfortunately i sized up (6) based on past reviews and had to exchange for a smaller size(4). the fabric does have a bit of stretch so i'm really not sure why so many people had sizing issues. this is really a great buy with the current sale. tempted to pick up the red version too.,5
I absolutely love this dress. i have received so many compliments. the quality is incredible.,5
"This dress looks and feels cheap. the white material is stiff and does not iron nicely. the grey sweater is super thin and very cheap looking. overall, a pretty horrible dress. save your money,",1
"I got this in the floral print before it sold out, and i have never received so many compliments on a dress! it hangs so nicely and is so flattering. the neckline doesn't bother me at all (i know some reviewers mentioned that), but i am a very small busted woman so maybe it has something to do with that? i find it super comfortable, like wearing a nightgown. i am so in love with this dress i just ordered it again in black. it will be a summer staple. i found it runs true to size (i'm 5'3"", 115 p",5
"I'm usually a fan of maeve, but this dress is just bad. the fabric is thin and filmy, and it stretches to sheer over your chest. the turtleneck is neither tight nor loose, it just droops in a most unfortunate way.",1
"This is a great dress. i purchased the red and gold motif. i like that it is versatile and very comfortable. plus, it has pockets!!! love that! i am fuller in the bottom, so i was concerned with the pockets adding bulk. so far, so good.",5
"I bought this dress for my daughter for her birthday and she loved it! she tells me she has worn it many times and gets compliments each time on both the style and the color (ordered the orange). it's a lovely lightweight knit and is easy to dress up or down, plus it is so comfortable and flattering!",5
"I watched this dress for quite awhile and when it went on sale ordered it. i'm very happy with the purchase. it's swingy and fun, looks great with tall boots too. i said it runs true to size but i bet the size smaller would have been great too just because it is a bit of a looser fit.",5
There's a stretch and a swing to the dress that makes you feel light and free. really sexy as pictured with boots and scarf,5
"Soft and flowy. fit is great. quality is great. i love this dress and i purchased in the turquoise color as well. i haven't worn a dress in 10+ years so i had a lot of reservation that this would be my first. highly recommend.
i paired this with 4"" short black suede boots and black tights. many compliments (even from my husband and he doesn't usually pay much attention).",5
"This dress is so cute! i went to the store to try it on and although i knew the dress would fit i could not get the zipper up. my mom, the sales lady and i all tried to get the zipper up and it would not move past the ribbon. i wish i could have bought this dress but i can't without a working zipper. i tried a size up and every dress at the store that was my size and none of them worked. please fix the zipper problem so i can have this dress!",1
"The blue version of this dress originally caught my eye on-line, but wasn't available in the store, so i tried the green one, mainly for size since everyone said it runs a bit small. i did have to size up one or two sizes. i fell in love with the green dress and bought it. it is so comfortable, great quality fabric (not too thin or too heavy). looks great on. i have received several compliments.",5
"I love this dress so much, i've considered getting it in the other prints. it's fitted in all the right places and has pockets! i love that it's stretchy. i'm a 36d and it's hard to fit dresses over the chest. this dress is a dream!",5
Love this swing dress. i purchased it for work. it is light and comfy. i wear it with tights and boots. i even purchased it in another color.,5
Very pretty but too short for my age. looks well made and green dress is beautiful. it was just too short for me to be comfortable wearing.,5
"Ordered this in the orange (black, white and turquoise) print in both a small and medium. the style is cute and i like the high neckline that shows off the shoulders and swing skirt that falls beautifully and hides a multitude of figure problems. :) i also previously bought the emerson swing dress, which is the same style by maeve. the emerson style ran a bit larger and as the reviews there state, the armholes were a bit long - so i ended up with a small in that one. this lilt swing dress, howev",5
"I purchased a medium. i am 5'6"" 140 lbs and it fit perfectly. the navy is pretty dark, almost black. the fabric is very soft. the cut is more form fitting in the top and then comes out to an a line. it is not as bulky as some swing dresses. in the photo it almost looks like a handkerchief hem, but in real life it is less pronounced. i have no negatives. i would consider getting a second pattern if it goes on sale.",5
The most important thing is that my husband said he really liked the dress when i put it on.,5
"I purchased this dress in the navy and white stripe. i did purchase the petite since i'm 5'2"" and it worked out great. very nice style, comfy and flattering. looks great with a pair of boots. one of my go to dresses for sure.",5
"I bought this dress in the navy stripe version and love it. the material is so soft it's like wearing pajamas, and the actual swing skirt is flattering (which surprised me when i tried it on). i wore it to work with burgundy heels and got a lot of compliments from my co-workers. i'm 5'9"", 130 lbs and the xs worked best for me.",5
This dress is great! i purchased the navy colorway. it is really soft and the fabric flows nicely. i was lucky enough to snag this on sale so i couldn't beat the price. i like the buttons on the sleeves. it adds just a cute special touch. i'm 5'3 and this hits me right at the knee.,5
This dress was perfect for the fall/winter. i wish i would have bought more colors. the fabric is soft and clings just enough. i lived in it this winter.,5
"This dress is very comfy and soft. i am returning because i didn't like it being a turtle neck, just a personal dislike.",5
"I should have listened to the previous review on-line before ordering. unfortunately this will go back as the design fit and proportions are simply off. i love uniquely shaped wraps like this, but this one didn't make the cut for me.",1
"Putting my two cents in regarding how fantastic this dress is! i bought the medium petite in navy stripe. it fits great, it's not too clingy and it's flattering to my disproportionate figure (makes me look more hourglass).",5
"Great dress! needs a tank top underneath, but has a great shop.",5
"I love this dress, it's very comfortable, slim swing and very ingratiating. the fabric is light, i like the details of the buttons on the sleeves. overall, i'm pleased and happy for the purchase of this dress. i will definitely recommend it.",5
"This is such an amazing take on a white blouse. it's fun and still polished! the fabric is so soft and so easy to dress up or down!

the arm holes run a little small but the cut of everything else is amazing.",5
"This is a great dress, both in design and comfort. the material is very soft and warm. yet it is also very stylish, and can be dressed up with big necklaces, a belt, and boots. the stylist in the store mentioned wearing it with a vest. it is a great piece that has so many possibilities. i bought it in navy. thank you retailer!!",5
"I almost ordered this dress yesterday online but did not. i went into my local retailer today and they had it in stock. tried it and completely fell in love with it and even my retailer lady in the back was amazed!
i am 5""5"", 115lbs. and went with the xs petite.
excellent price point.

gorgeous in ""neutral""....

tts

highly recommend!",5
"The stress is a simple basic. i got it in the navy stripe and have worn it with the long gray scarf, similar to pictured. it is very soft and comfortable.",5
They make your butt look great! very whimsical design.,5
"Love this dress!  it has a nice stretchy weight to it and is texturally interesting. it's the first retailer piece that i ever bought my teenage daughter and she looks so sophisticated in it, like a young lady. it's both classy and youthful!  for reference, she's 5'5 100# and is wearing a 00.",5
"I'm not sure why this dress has such bad online reviews because i absolutely love it! it fit tts for me, but i have a large bust so will run big if you are smaller on top. i don't like paying full price usually, but the quality and beauty of this dress justified it! if you are into prints and colors, you will definitely be able to pull it off :)",5
"I tried on the regular size at my store (wish stores close to me carried petites), and it was jsut too overwhelming (aka big). i wanted to purcahse the petite, however, as i really like it (striked out as they are sold out in my size, bummer).

the cut is otherwise flattering, and the sweater is really comfortable. i like all the contrasting ""colors"" and patterns too.",5
"I bought this 'nightgown' to wear as a winter maternity dress. it really fit the bill!! the knit fabric stretched nicely as i grew but was still flattering before i got larger as well. there is no way i would actually sleep in this dress. it would be way too hot! it is cute with calf length boots and i look forward to rocking it without the belly next winter. i would normally wear a petite length and bought the medium and though it was longer, the length was not awkward and kept it from being to",5
"This is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer. the sleeves are so weird and ugly. they get really fat at the top, like a dolman sleeve, but it looks really strange because they don?t flow into the rest of the top, which is very structured. it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders. this is not apparent in the model picture at all. the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri",1
Many complements today at work! comfortable even on days you don't want to wear something form fitting,5
"To my surprise this sweater is heavy, chic and stylish. its well made and fits tts. i'm looking forward to wearing it. i would recommend this tunic to everyone. it looks better on me than the model.....event though it doesn't look bad. you need curves to enhance the look of this tunic sweater. i really like all the different textures in this sweater.",5
I am not sure who would look good in this dress. it is extremely oversized with tons of fabric that will not flatter anyone!,1
"It is hard to believe that this is called a chemise! it is a fabulous dress! this dress caught my eye in the store and i had to try it on. i went with the navy, which is beautiful and has a great pattern. i had to order a petite xs because the regular xs was loose in my shoulder area. i am petite and narrow and 5'1"". the petite xs was perfect for me. it is quite form fitting and does show curves, lumps and bumps so i wore my dress with spanx tights. it was such an easy dress to wear, looked styl",5
"I don't usually pay full-price for retailer clothes, but i had a 20%-off coupon and i decided to give this dress a try, as it irradiated a happy vibe and reminded me of books and dress-up clothes from my childhood. i don't regret it one bit! the colors and the print are absolutely beautiful and i love how they mix up and contrast in a subtle way. i really like the long sleeves with the elastic at the wrist. the cord at the waist hangs with a fun mix of tiny beads, faux mini crab claws, and faux mi",5
"This dress was returned to my store and i was immediately drawn to it. i love absolutely anything with a full shape, and this dress has it! its cut like a circle...so ladies this dress has a lot of fabric. i'm 5'8 and wouldn't be able to wear it as a dress, but it made for an adorable tunic with leggings. the arms are a tad more fitted (though i have larger arms) which helped make the dress feel super cool and feminine. if you love a cool quirky piece, this one is a winner!",5
"The blue looks a lot more grey in person and i've gotten several compliments wearing it with black leggings and grey booties. the texture/print is really unique. i'm 5' 11"" 135 pounds and a small fits perfect. highly recommend!!",5
This is such a fun dress to wear. i wanted something comfortable and flirty and this checked off both boxes. im typically a small size 6 but went w x-small on this one to hug the shoulders more.,5
"The sweater is comfortable and a good weight. the zipper is very difficult, but i do not have to unzip the sweater to pull it on.",5
"Bought this dress as a winter dress. it looks amazing, and even more so with some boots. love it. also, its more gray than blue, although i like that.",5
"I had no idea this was considered sleepwear until after i bought it. i saw it in the store and promptly tried it on, it is really flattering. i wear it as a sweater dress on a regular basis. it is really comfortable, and is something you could dress up with booties or be more casual with cute tennis shoes like keds. i get compliments on it all the time. i also like the slit a lot.",5
"I think the model photo doesn't do this dress justice. it's comfortable and perfect for a summery day. i wear it to work with a light grey cardigan, and of course it works well causally. i'm busty --d on a small frame -- but there's not gapping. the colors are pretty with blues and pinks without being childish.",5
"The embroidery is actually navy blue, not black like it shows in the photos, which was even better for me. these are so soft and feminine looking. love love love! please make more decorated and embroidered hyphens like you have in the past retailer :)",5
I purchased these jeans in my regular size.  they are a slouchy slim leg that looks adorable with flats or heels.. i could have sized down but wanted the slouchy look. they are very stretchy and soft. have worn a few times and they retained thier shape...,5
I have been eyeing these jeans the last few times i have been in retailer shopping but did not really need another expensive pair of jeans. today i finally gave in and tried them on. i fell in love and bought them. i sized down one size. they are so darn cute!! i ended up also buying the pilcro em jeans too. loving pilcro' new cuts and styles lately. the embroidery on these jeans is unique and they are really flattering. already planning to wear them out to lunch with friends tomorrow. highly reco,5
"Cloth and stone never lets me down! awesome quality, comfort, and versatility. i imagine myself living in this dress this summer! soft fabric, easy breezy fit, pockets, machine washable...what's not to love? go buy it!",5
"I wasn't expecting much out of this when i was in the store, but liked the colors and thought i'd try it out. grabbed a s and xs (i'm usually a s in everything but maeve is weird sometimes) - the s fit perfectly (tts), and the xs felt tight in the shoulder seam as well as in the armpit. it does have a detachable slip/liner that may be too fitted for some of you are prone to that issue. in the model shot i think the horizontal seam at the swing portion looks higher than it was on me...falling low",5
"Love this comfy, breezy dress. so easy & cool to wear around the hood or casual dinner out. i gave 4 stars for quality because of a small gap in seam near one of the pockets, which i'll fix next time the sewing basket is out. i think the double layers of gauze-like material makes the dress a little delicate if you have animals, so be a careful around claws & paws. the back side is straight which isn't as interesting as the front but for my use, the dress is darling.",5
"Love the colors for fall, feels good and perfect for work. size seems to run a little large but overall works really well and can go to work and out at night - perfect!",5
"The moment i saw this dress, i knew i had to have it. the plaid is beautiful with tones of red, blue and periwinkle. the photos on the website are very true. the unexpected pockets make it even cuter. i also got the sandals as pictured because i love the whole look. i an 5'5"" and usually wear a 4 or 6. i got the small and then wondered if it were too big. i ended up going back and trying on the extra small, but it turns out the small was correct. it should hang and drape and it not meant to be f",5
"I love this sweater. it's heavy, with a rich texture that feels like very cool grandma. the cut is straight, and the collar feels natural. a small wraps closed across my chest (usually a s/4/6) without being baggy. falls to my mid-calf at 5'6"".",5
This dress was exactly what i wanted. great material. cute pale blue slip lining the dress. i ordered a medium and it was perfect. i am about 5'6 and about 145. i received compliments all day on how cute it was,5
There were only 2 pairs left in my store and they had my size! they are super comfortable and easy to wear with anything on top because of the navy embroidery being such a classic color. i would definitely recommend. i may buy the floral embroidery ones too.,5
"Love just know the embroidery is navy blue wearing them today, size down",5
I ordered a size down as the reviews suggested and i love them!! they are so cute and snug enough in the calf that i can wear boots with them in winter.  great buy!,5
"This dress looks way better than pictured online. it is lyocel i think so it has a little bit of weight (not heavy and bulky like denim but not as thin as some chambray items i've purchased before) and lays great! i purchased a size small, i am 5'8'' 128lbs and thought it was true to size, i can't wait to wear this! warm weather, sandals and a tote for running errands!",5
"I am so pleased with my purchase. the two different levels of the dress is just simply fun and unique. the attached matching, adjustable baby blue slip is a nice add. neither the dress or slip fit too tight or too loose around my torso. i ordered a small which fits me perfect and in case it is helpful, i am 5'7"", 133, and a 36a. 
if you have been considering this dress, don't delay, especially at the wonderful sale price!",5
"This dress is beautiful on, is thin enough to be extremely comfortable. being curvy, it feels a little more narrow than i would prefer, but i kept it anyway because it is so beautiful as well as functional.",5
"I like these jeans. when i wore them, i received compliments. they do run large. i sized down one size, but probably could have sized down two sizes. they feel tight when you first put them on, but as you wear them, they loosen up and i find myself pulling them up to meet my waist. my other complaint is a small one. the embroidered flower on the knee rubs against your knee as you move. after awhile, my right knee felt like it had a carpet burn on it. that is why i gave this only 4 stars for desi",5
"I love these jeans! when i saw them in my retailer store, i instantly fell in love. they fit like a dream and they look so much better in person than online. they're definitely a boyfriend fit, so if you're between sizes, go down a size. i've already gotten tons of compliments!",5
"These jeans are beautiful. as the other reviewers have noted...they run very large...like 2 sizes, even then they are very stretchy. the embroidery is dark blue (looks black on screen)....lovely pair of jeans. if they had other colors i would by them!",5
"I'm 5'7 and 137 pounds and i tried on this dress in the store. i got the small as it has a little more material in the medium and the small fits like a glove. this dress is great quality and feels good, looks good and can be dressed up or down. like the model in the picture i like the flats with this dress. high quality fashion and total comfort on a hot summer day. go anywhere with this dress and you look like a million dollars. one more little hidden detail it has a detachable slip underneath",5
"I stalked this sold out product for weeks hoping my size would become available. when it did, i was very excited, in fact i ordered both a s and xs to be sure one sweater would fit me! unfortunately, neither did and i felt the actual sweater was not as pictured. the sweater has an overall baggy fit and the cutouts don't fall as neatly and as evenly on both shoulders as the picture shows, making the look a bit sloppy in my opinion. it is such a shame as this look is very of the moment and the mod",1
"I ordered this dress on a whim because of the lush colors and the sale price. to my amazement, it has become one of my go-to dresses. it is far more handsome and flattering in person. i ordered a m for my 5'9"" and 36c frame and the fit is perfect. contrary to how the back of the dress is shown on the model, the back is not straight, but flows whimsically thereby adding to its famine appeal. at this price, it's a no-brainier purchase.",5
"If they still have your size, grab it. fits a bit snug in chest, but material is light and airy. got so many compliments on it. great style",5
Love this dress! the material has a softness to it - just love it! can't wait to wear it this summer. fits true to size.,5
"I actually ended up buying two of these dresses. i took the first one to the dry cleaner and they chewed up the slip and put a hole in the dress. i was so sad that i went and bought a second one before they could sell out. the good news is that it was on sale! this is an awesome light and airy dress that is great for those hot summer days. i pretty much wear it every opportunity i get. for reference i purchased the small. it's loose but the shoulders, armholes and slip all fit perfectly. i weigh",5
"I wasn't going to even try to see it this dress would fit.  it just seemed like such an unflattering silhouette since my body is nothing like the model.  i'm so glad i gave it a try because this dress is cute and comfy and looks great on me when i belt it!  my outfit is a floppy straw hat, skinny leather belt and flat sandals.  there's a lot of fabric but it gathers well without poofing out.  i ordered the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#.",5
I fell in love with this dress immediately. gorgeous print and colors. light and breezy. classic and comfortable. the petite length is perfect for my height and hits a few inches above the knee. i have a small bust (34a) but a wider rib cage so the petite small was a perfect fit. couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.,5
Love this dress so much. it's super comfortable and i always get a ton of compliments every time i wear it. the fabric is the perfect weight not too heavy. i'll be wearing this all summer long.,5
"I love this dress. i don't have many pink things but saw someone in this on instagram and had to have it. it is as comfy as a nightgown. it has pockets! i tried it with brown sandals as well as with a dark jean jacket and taggart grey booties and looks cute both ways. also looks great with a blingy necklace. tts- got my normal med and it's roomy, but not too big.",5
"Gorgeous dress. it was designed to accentuate a woman's figure. lovely material, holds everything in place without being too revealing. the dress does not lose its shape. definitely a head turner",5
"This is one of the best purchases f
i have made at retailer recently. i got this in ivory in my usual xs. the pictures do not do it justice.  it has such a nice drape and i love the detail on the back.  looks great with black cropped trousers, as well as skinny jeans.",5
I bought this shirt along with a matching vest and duster........love it!,5
This top fits well as expected for the size. i love the ease of the top and wear it both casually and a bit more dressed up. great styling on the back.,5
"I bought this at the retailer store the other day and i wore it to work and i received so many complements. it has the perfect amount of swing and hides your middle without looking frumpy. i got the blue color and wore it with skinny jeans and ankle boots. the red is really more of a bight pink color, not a rich red as pictured. i wish it came in more colors and patterns...maybe green or purple? it does run big, i usually take a large, but a medium was perfect.",5
"Lovely top, very rich looking, i always get compliments. it's loose fitting but not baggy and the embroidery is well done.",5
"I am normally a 4, but they only had the white in size 2, so i tried it. i was pleased to see that it worked out just fine because it is meant to flow, therefore has plenty of fabric. it is very graceful and very pleasant to wear. i don't know how to explain it, but i had to take a second look when i saw it on the photograph because i was not sure it was the same blouse. much better in reality than on the picture.",5
"Love this top. it's everything all the previous viewers said....except that the white isn't white but a creamy white.it has a yellow under tone.. this restricts my over all plans,but i still like it.",5
"I really wanted to love the shorts.  when i read that the shorts were lined, i expected them to be lined so that my underwear didn't show.  even though the shorts are lined, you can see through the fabric completely.  this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design; pockets; and, comfortable waistline.  i'm returning the shorts as well.",1
"I have so many compliments on this blouse. i love the style and design. i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 5""8 tall. i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it won't look right in the back kinda hang out. otherwise really nice quality blouse. i would definitely buy another just to have a back up.",5
"I was a little hesitant about this dress at first because it looks a bit baggy on top on the model. but decided to order it online anyway based on reviews. well i must say, i'm so glad i did! i really love the shape of this dress. i'm heavy on top but it somehow minimizes that and it also accentuates my waist. the dress is very well made. if you order the right size for you, the slip dress will stay in place. i'm going to style it with high black platform heels, but i also like it with boots as",5
There isn't anything i don't love about this dress! get it before it's gone! i get compliments every time i wear this dress.,5
"For once, the dress looks better on me than on the model. mine is tight above the bow and black/grey. my bow isn't this big?not pulled so much and maybe it's not knotted in the photo. it's heavy canvas and doesn't show my flaws. i'm saving it for summer?can't imagine wearing it as a jumper as in the photo.

for me (5'3"", 32e, 125 lbs) the bust is slightly tight in a 6 but the shoulders are a bit wide in an 8, but both look good. mine is not petite and hits me above the knee (6).

the dress is co",5
I tried this in store and fell in love. i'm usually between a 0 and a 2 in tops and took this in a 0 because of how flow and lose this is. the fabric is light and not bulky so it can also be tucked in.,5
Super soft and comfortable with a flattering fit. love the tiny buttons and the 3/4 sleeves since many times the sleeves are too long for me. already my favorite fall top.,5
"I was a little hesitant to order this, thinking it would be too large and unflattering but thankfully i was wrong. this shirt is super cute and comfy. it is a bit of an oversized fit but the fabric drapes nicely and is quite flattering. my new go to outfit this fall will be this shirt with the sleeves rolled up, ankle jeans and my fave oxfords. i'm 5'3"", 115lbs and went with the size 4 regular",5
"Such pretty pattern and colors, pleased with dress",5
"This shirt is very soft and fits nicely. as with a lot of maeve tops, the arms are a little snug so if you have muscular arms you'll definitely want to size up. it won't make the shirt too ""blousey"" because it will still look really cute tucked in in the front with ankle jeans and a trendy belt. i wish i had gotten this in the blue before it sold out because it is lovely!",5
"I bought this in both the black motif and the ivory. i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size. the fabric is very comfortable and doesn't wrinkle easily. it does have a ""flowy"" look to it but i didn't find that it had too much fabric. i wouldn't tuck it in though. i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days. the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique. i recommend the shirt.",5
My expectations were blown away in the best way when i tried on this top.  i typically have issues with button-downs in the chest area (buttons never lay flat) and this top lays perfectly.  the material is super soft.  looks great buttoned all the way up or with a few buttons left open.  i can't wait to wear with a pair of black high-waisted jeans this fall!,5
"Beautiful blouse that can be dressed up or dressed down. online shows as purple, but the black mortif is be true black background with pretty floral colors. i rarely wear floral design, but this blouse make it work. the material is such a soft rayon material. love, love, love.",5
"The first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric didn't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue.  i'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage, which was a nice surprise, because i usually avoid anything with fullness.  will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect.  i'm short, 5'3"".  neckline is fem",5
Love this dress! it's exactly as pictured and the fabric design is so pretty. will look great with a cardigan for fall but also will look nice for summer with the cutout in the back. nice too that it has a detachable slip.,5
"I looked at this on the hanger and almost passed it up. i'm so glad i didn't because it ended up looking so much better on. i wear a s or xs in retailer tops and went with the xs. i'm 5'6"" and it still had plenty of room and enough length to cover my backside. i usually gravitate to reds but the red in this top, while pretty, had too much pink in it for me.",5
"These are soft and skim the body the way well fitted undergarments should. they do not pinch, bind, or ride up. they coordinate perfectly with the matching bra. i am very pleased with this purchase.",5
"This blouse drapes and floats lightly like a dream. the dark black patterned top is not see-through which means you can easily wear it without having to layer. the length covers past your hips and the pattern is flattering.

the doubled-up buttons makes the blouse unique and it's comfortable enough to wear to work or with jeans from late summer into fall.",5
This shirt is wonderful! i love the styling and the print. sure to be a favorite!,5
"This is a super comfy and adorable shirt. got the black motif - it could def. be passed off as a dark/inkish navy color, too, so it's very versatile. it runs typical/tts for maeve (if you're unfamiliar with the brand, order up one or two sizes if you have broad shoulders and/or large arms). this is super lightweight; feels ""slinky"" for lack of a better word. essentially, it's rayon-gauze- but it is double-layered, so it is not sheer at all (no need for a cami, although in the lighter version i c",5
I got the blue. it is very short. one side of the shirt i received was shorter that the other. the material feels cheap and pleats out a bit right over the bust - only flattering on small busted models.,1
"I got this shirt as a gift. it's cute and very comfortable. it is,however, a little thin so you may need to wear something underneath.",5
"I purchased this in blue. it has a soft fabric and seems well made. i have worn it several times and think it is quite comfortable. i bought one size up due to comments on the site, but my daughter thinks i should have stuck to the size chart.",5
"I got the navy blue pattern and i absolutely love it. it's soft and cozy and just dressy enough to pull an outfit together.  i initially sized up to a 10 based on other reviews but exchanged it for an 8, my normal size. it's flowy so the bigger size was way too much fabric. in the 8 it's just right for the style.",5
I absolutely loved this top. it fit great and was easy to dress up or down. i wore it once and washed it according to the tag. cold water and flat dry. it is now 4 sizes too small and unwearable. extremely disgusted.,1
"I bought this shirt in a size 10. i am a 32 4d and it fit perfect, but wanted it to fit flowy as it does on the model...so sizing up to a 12. very nice quality fabric...not sure how it will be after it's washed. looks just like the picture. i bought the ivory color.",5
I love maeve designs in general and find that their sizing and quality is consistent. this top is so soft and a bit billowy.. the darker pattern in the black motif combined with the lightweight nature of the material make it perfect for fall. i love the little details: staggered/ paired buttons down the front and interesting seaming that isn't as apparent in the photos. considering another color as well...,5
"I love this blouse. it is soft and has nice drape. even though it is very voluminous on the bottom, the true-to-size cut of the arms and shoulders as well as the seaming in back keep it crisply tailored and not overwhelming. thinking about buying more prints!",5
"Swingy and just the right weight for the office. the cream is ever so slightly sheer but looks really good with a darker bra, even for the office because you can't really see through it. i'm wearing this all the time this fall and winter with skirts, black pants, and skinny jeans",5
"Great spring time dress that looks good with a thin top, a cardigan or by itself. the fit is a bit loose but not oversized in my usual size, so if you want a slimmer silhouette or you are not busty, i would size down. love the fabric as it has some give despite its thickness. i would have paid full price but i'm lucky to have purchased on sale.",5
I love this top! the length is just right and i love the flow of it!,5
I love this shirt. i bought the ivory color. it's incredibly comfortable and an easy style.,5
"The sales girl added this to my room, it's so darling and it came home with me.",5
"I really like how this shirt flows and feels. the details are super cute (double buttons in front, pleats in back). great shirt to transition to fall.",5
I purchased this striped racer tank to wear during the day on july 4th! it was perfect! the back is really special and dresses it up!,5
"I wanted this so much that i purchased it at full price. i purchased the light denim in a petite small.
this dress would be flattering on any figure. i am an hourglass and it is so flattering on me. i am also busty and this dress fits quite nicely as well. the material is thicker and somewhat stiff in a positive way. it has substance and the detail zipper on the back is different. this brand has never let me down. the tie doesn't have to look like the one in the picture. i made a lose double kn",5
"This skirt arrived today and i love it. the fabric is substantial and can be worn in the fall and maybe even on a mild california winter day. i plan on wearing it with tights and/or boots. the fabric will go with a variety of colored tops and sweaters. it's not ""pull on styling"". it has a side zipper. fits true to size, but is longer on me than the model, but then i am pretty short. got this on sale!!",5
"This jumpsuit is a classic!!!!! i read the reviews where some were complaining about the buttons i did not have these issues (maybe because i have short fingernails). i like this jumpsuit because the style of it will be around for a long time. you can dress the jumpsuit up or down. i rarely pay full price but this jumpsuit is so great/fantastic, that i did not mind doing so. i strongly recommend this jumpsuit.",5
"Rompers are my fav so i'm biased writing this review. although they are a little tricky with the fit i definitely can say that this beauty makes my body look amazing! the cut of the fabric makes for a great shape. yes, the first couple of buttons  are tough to get on but i'm guessing that after a couple of wears it will get easier. i got my usual size 4 and it fit like it was made specifically for me. i'm very happy with this purchase.",5
These pants have great style and movement.,5
"As others mentioned, you have to unbutton all tiny buttons to put on and off... i do hope this gets easier with use... but - gorgeous and flattering as all get out! :-) i love the design in the back, and the little annoying buttons are sooo cute. the cut is super flattering, and classy. i can wear this to work, or out, just don't drink too much water ladies.... i am 115 lbs and 30dd chest, and the 0 petite was perfect. seriously, beautiful... so torn (keeping it for now!)",5
"This top makes you feel like you should be in the tropics sipping a frosty cocktail. fabric is soft, not too sheer. i'm usually an xs and that's what i kept in this top. armholes not too low as in some. for reference, 5'4"", 123 lbs",5
"This is a gorgeous top. it is a very soft fabric that drapes beautifully. i purchased the red print - i tried both on in the store. the red really pops. i've only
owed this top for a week and i've received many compliments on it.",5
"I am usually between a 8 and a 10 and was an 8 in this skirt, it is very nice because it has so many soft colors in it and will go with anything. i live in florida so for me this is a fall skirt! i like the look of a wrap and it is not a wrap it fits great.",5
"Just picked this up in my retailer store and i love it. i bought the orange print and the colors are vibrant and perfect for summer. i am 5'5"" and  140 lbs. i took a small which is my usual size at retailer. could be worn unbuttoned as a sleeveless cardi over a tank. i will wear a cami underneath as it is sheer, but that doesn't bother me. another shopper was trying this on in the fitting room and it looked great on both of us. i will wear this all summer long. looks great with denim. happy find!",5
"I absolutely love this dress! the fabric is very light and airy while not being revealing. the color, being nude as indicated, is a nice change from plain white or off white and the embroidery is just beautiful and makes this dress quite unique. i love the fact that it is a tunic dress which lends to less of a structured look and more of an easy casual style. i recently wore this dress to an out door bbq and was both cool and comfortable all day. i also received many compliments from friends and",5
"This top can be dressed up or down. i got it in the blue motif. it is so cute and that wearable, washable fabric. i am a medical student so it is important for me to be able to wash my clothing and not wear things too low-cut (i.e. professionalism). this top fits the bill while still being fabulous. of course it is loose-fitting on the bottom, as the image indicates. it is a swing top. i recommend with skinny pants.",5
"I just received this and wore it immediately - it is cute even under a cardigan because the pattern 'peeks' out, giving some depth to an otherwise plain white shirt. the material is soft and sort of on the thin side but not see-through. it is a fine knit, and has a satin-like thread to it which makes it soft and cool - perfect for a summer day! it is not as slim on me as the model but i am very petite (51 100 lb) and i think this would run closer to tts.",5
"Although this is an online only, i was lucky enough to stumble along a return in the store. this is the same quality and soft fabric that i expect from tyhlo. it doesn't show as much in the model photos, but this top has a subtle high-low effect, which adds a bit of elegance to the top.

i took my usual size xs in the tyhlo brand. however, note that i am small busted (~34b/c) and this was already starting to pull some across the chest. my biggest critique it that this pulling caused a small ga",5
"I love the bright floral print flanking the solid white middle in this top. with its swing style and large arm holes i think i could have sized down and been ok, but i usually wear a cami with my tanks so the arm holes are not an issue. also, it has a touch of spandex in it which make it extra comfy. overall, a darling top!",5
"If you haven't yet joined the jumpsuit bandwagon, now is the time! this jumpsuit is absolutely stunning! classy, elegant and a stand out piece. i purchased at full price. i have a hard time with jumpsuits as i am quite tall and they usually look like an adult onsie on me - this jumpsuit made me feel beautiful, put together and graceful. i cannot recommend it enough! fit is true to size, i am a 4 and purchased the 4. not too short in the crotch and i am almost 5'10. form fitting but still a bit f",5
I purchased the orange version (definitely orange - not red) before heading out on vacation and it was perfect for hot summer weather. the swingy shape keeps you cool and the print is much better in person. the fabric is very soft and hangs well. look forward to wearing to work also with a cardigan. i own a few akemi + akin tops and always get a s. this one seemed a bit large even in s but i liked the length so kept the s.,5
"This jumpsuit is so cute and it looked amazing on. i had to return it because of the poor design. it was extremely hard to put on and take off! there are so many buttons to do and undo which are not as easy as snaps! the fabric buttons definitely make a great look to the jumpsuit but there should be a zipper on the side for easy access, or use snaps instead of the loops for the fabric buttons. what a shame of a lovely and classy design on a good quality material, but not worth it if it's difficu",1
"This tank is super amazing. very versatile - wore to work with dress pants and flats, and wore out to dinner with jeans and heels. a bit out of my comfort zone since it is a ""swing"" tank, but love the color and cut! perfect for professional life and going out on the town. i did choose a petite in this due to the long armholes (even though i have a long torso for my body size).",5
"These pants are so comfortable, it's ridiculous. they are lightweight and perfect for spring/summer at the office or an evening out. i am 5'9"" and the pants fit as pictured. i paired with a sweater and kitten heels. they do run a little large so consider going down a size.",5
This kimono is beautiful! pictures definitely do not do it justice! i love the details of the beading and sequins throughout. the only downfall is that they can snag and get fall off quite easily. delicate but still my fav kimono ever.,5
"I was excited to get this shirt in the mail, i liked the pattern a lot, but was so disappointed when i tried it on. i am 5'4"", 130 lbs. and wear a c cup so i tried ordering a small as a starting point. there was enough fabric on the sides to make another shirt! despite the excess fabric, the shirt pulled open in the chest area, making it a complete fail. i'm sure the model in the photo must have the shirt clipped in the back to pull in the excess fabric, especially since she's small on top. ther",1
"I cannot keep my hands off this gorgeous kimono - i want to wear it every day! it goes with so much of my wardrobe. it's thin, and cool (both meanings of cool apply). i like to keep my arms covered (i think my upper arms are too fat) and this kimono does just that, while keeping me cool as a cucumber, i wear a sleeveless white or gray cami under it and it is soooo comfortable, i could sleep in it. it would also look great with lime green cami and white pants. so far, i wear it with blue jeans an",5
"This is a soft, comfortable and flattering alternative to a regular t-shirt - not dressy, but a little more put together looking. it also doesn't wrinkle, so it's my go-to travel shirt for warmer months.",5
"I bought this to wear in the warm climates, when you go indoors it is always freezing. i also travel a lot and wanted something light weight to wear on the plane and airport. wore it the first day all day with jeans and top. lots of compliments. i was worried that driving in the car, it would get torn or snagged. didn't! loved it so much, going to by another one similar and have on again!",5
Fit great. hang nice. extra loop to hold belt. perfect design.,5
"Absolutely adorable!!! i must object to previous reviewers who have stated that the top ""fits nothing like that of the model in the photo"". i have found that it fits exactly like that ""look"". i usually wear xl but bought this one in large as the price was too good to pass up! this top affords the slightly slouchy look on top (thanks to the dolman sleeves) but with a bit more fit or i should say....with a bit better fit through the midriff than that of the model. one reviewer stated this top make",5
The shirt is beautiful but slightly long. it is see thru and you do need to wear a cami underneath.,5
The colors on this top are very bright & cheery. i love wearing this top. i get a lot of complements on the combination of the pastel colors. it reminds me of a warm summer day. i wear a pink tank under neath and it really brings out the pink colors of the top.,5
"I love this jumpsuit! i'm usually a size small, however i was a lot more comfortable in an xs. the fit was comfortable and sexy! i received a lot of compliments and a couple of ""i need to borrow that from you""! i'm only 5' tall so it went down all the way to my ankles but i paired it with 4"" open toed heels and it worked! the neck line is pretty high but you can adjust it to your comfort. i highly recommend this jumpsuit ...even to the petite ladies!",5
"I was really excited to get this dress, i initially ordered a small (i am a size 4) but when i tried it on, it was really tight. the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit, and the dress just looked off. i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there, and the look of the dress on line was beautiful, but just didn't fit right. i did love the lace look, and would love seeing more dresses with this design.",1
"This jumpsuit looked so great on the model, and looked so hideous on me. i'm 5'4"" and in great shape, and this jumpsuit looked absolutely ridiculous....not to mention it rode right up my backside in the worst possible way. i'm so disappointed!",1
"This is a beautiful shirt. like many other reviewers stated, this shirt does not have a lining. but any white camisole works just fine. love it! i've already gotten tons of compliments.",5
I have a love and hate with fit and fashion. i love super beautiful clothes that are comfortable to wear. normally i am the one everyone keeps asking where did you buy that and i inwardly roll my eyes because my rule of thumb is dress with the most comfortable thing i can. now i'm also a full figured mama. these outfit made me look chic parisian and made my derriere look like it was very attractive. i have a long torso and a long neck and long legs and it hid my flaws. so if you want to look lik,5
"This dress did not show well on the hanger but thankfully it intrigued me. i love it, it's very flattering and easily dressed up for work with a heel or dressed down for the weekend. great buy!",5
"I think i've made a hobby out of trying on jumpsuits & rompers this season. i now own three (including this one in my usual size small: 32d-31-38). i passed right by this on-line but it drew my attention in the store. i didn't realize it was chocolate brown and ivory (i'm a sucker for brown). i tried it on on a whim and it looked great. i am tall--almost 5' 9"" and it looked great. i will say it shows off my bottom (for better or worse) more than other jumpsuits. it doesn't give me a wedgie but a",5
"First of all, this is so much prettier in person. if i were looking online, i would have scrolled right by this beauty. i am usually a medium or small in retailer tops and dresses. in jeans, i am a size 8 or 10 but i always have to get the waist taken in (little waist, big thigh problem). this piece was tricky for me but i ended up with a medium because the legs are so roomy. also, there are little ties on the sides to pull in the waist more if necessary. the scarf can also be tied behind the neck",5
"This top is even more beautiful and vibrant in person, but you definitely need a racerback cami underneath it as the laser cuts are big. the first time i wore it today, i got a number of compliments. a definite keeper.",5
Cute top. fits short but roomy. will get a lot of use in my wardrobe.,5
This shirt is super soft and comfortable! luckily it's a good length and not at all short!,5
"I am so happy i decided to try this on in store. it is absolutely stunning! unfortunately they only had a m and it was a little too flowy so have the s ordered and anxious to try it on. the top is really where i am concerned it is too large. i am 5'3"", 36dd and 130#, athletic build. since you really cannot wear a bra with it, which is okay btw, the armholes were a little too open and afraid things may show ;). the bottom fit okay, a little on the large side but this should fit loose and flowy. c",5
"I've been wanting to buy a romper that was easy to wear and take off and i like this one for many reasons. the elastic waist ""holds"" the romper in place when you take the top off, the top comes off easily bc it's a halter and the design is very chic and sophisticated. the only down side is the tie is really heavy if you tie it in the back. it's better to tie it in the front like the model in this picture. it is a bit long (comes down to my ankles) but looks good with heels.",5
"I've been on the lookout for a great quality basic black and white stripe shirt. it's easy to find the super cheap ones that last you maybe four wears. this one is great quality, extremely soft, and comfortable. i'm usually a small in tops, but got this in a medium so that it would fit like the model, slightly loose, i didn't want it body hugging. so, if you're looking for that fit, go up a size, it doesn't stretch out much.",5
Great quality and beautiful color! i wear size 6 and ordered s. got lots of compliments :),5
"Fyi-the model is wearing the top with a cami tank under. on it's own, it's lace and has holes throughout. i prefer it that way, so you can layer to make it more conservative, but also wear with a nude bra for an edgier look. material washed well and has a pretty raw lace edge seam on the bottom!",5
"I couldn't decide whether to get it in the black and white stripe or the blue, so i bought both. these t-shirts are incredible--soft, comfortable, fit well (i'm 5'2 usually a size 2 in retailer clothing, xs fit true to size for this shirt). the blue is vibrant and, as another reviewer noted, there's a tiny black stripe in between the blue and white. the black and white is actually more of a cream/offwhite but still pleasing and versatile. sleeves roll up easily, which is a preference of mine. they",5
"Loving the ombrã© color combination, the smooth lining, the fuzzy felty warmth and the slimming effect when viewed from the front. if you are busty or hourglass, stay tts or size up. if you are straight and/or small busted, size down. if you have a round bottom but slender on top, i'm not sure this dress will fit the way you want, do try it on in person.",5
"I'm another borderline petite at 5'4"", and i loved this. the pants are like palazzos on me, and i think with a heel it will look great. i plan on wearing my hair up and tying the tie in the back in a big bow. in fact, i don't see the button back spoken of in the description, so i think one would have to do so!",5
This is one of those stunning retailer pieces that keep us coming back for more. it reminds me of the lithe dresses from the earlier retailer days. it fits tts. well made with side zipper that zips both the inner sheath and outer tulle overlay ( as opposed to those obnoxious linings that you wrestle with). the inner sheath has a fabulous lattice work pattern while the overlay has beading and embroidered detail.  sure to sell out.,5
"This top really pays attention to detail. it is very refreshing to buy a top that is lined so i don;t need to struggle to find the right cami to go underneath. also there is a lovely snap fixture to hold your bra strap in place. very thoughtful :) the top seems to run true to size and fits well. neither the arm holes or the v-neck are too low. i agree with the first reviewer that the main need for sizing up or down is due to breast size. i'm a 36dd and the 10 fit perfectly. also, the colors in t",5
"I absolutely love this top! i often shop the sale items first, but when i saw this top in the store, i didn't hesitate to pay full price. the material reminds me of vintage clothing - it is a dry clean only item, but is so special that it's worth it. the colors and construction (beautifully lined, bias trim) are impressive. and, this top looks better on me than on the model:)",5
"I took a risk and bought this blouse and got a wonderful surprise. i bought my usual size small (34c, 31"" waist) and it was perfect. the details of this blouse are amazing. you cannot see the flecks of copper-gold leaves all over the fabric or the gold threads running down the seam in the front. it is really, really beautiful. the fabric overall is soft and flowy and the sleeves do not stand out off my shoulders in a weird way. there is a soft flow of ruffle down both sides of the shirt. the fro",5
"Tried this little gem on in the store but they were out of my size. the ladies were so helpful, ordered it, shipped to me directly and i received it amazingly fast - not an easy task when you live off grid in north idaho!
i wore it last night to a st patrick's day party in california and received a ton of compliments. paired it with black leggings and strap or black heels. 
i'm still smiling today, can't wait to wear it again. the fit is flattering and the quality superb.
thanks retailer",5
This top is gorgeous! the print is lovely and the material and cut are well constructed. can't wait to wear!,5
"This dress is beautiful. it may run a tad large. everything about the dress is very appealing from the nice fabric, beautiful design and colors of the print. it will go straight into fall. so very happy i tried it! i have a beautiful, elegant dress for the hot weather.",5
I bought this top because i loved the floral print. i had no idea i was getting a top notch quality top. i love the flow of the bottom and the zipper in the back is so classy. it has a lining and the coolest thing about it is the snaps that protect your bra from showing. love love love this top!!,5
I was very disappointed with my recent retailer order. i ordered the meleri eyelet tank and it had a stain on the front. i also order a dress that came with a tear in the fabric. sale items should not be damaged unless the customer is aware of the damage and accepts it in that condition. very disappointing.,1
"Stunning! very well made. the colors are so vibrant and stand out without being too flashy. the cut is a bit strange but it works. runs true to size. i took my normal size 0. i rarely buy anything at retailer full price, but i made an exception with this one. a must buy!",5
Adorable peplum top! colors are much more rich in person. saw it in the store and stalked it online until it went on sale. beautiful material and craftsmanship. i thought it ran on the large side though wish it was a touch longer but not enough to not purchase. highly recommend....great piece to dress up or down and easily add layers for fall.,5
The most beautiful top in my closet and i have a huge closet of beautiful clothes! hope retailer carries more peasant top by this brand...stunning,5
"Nice fit and color and i love the tall cuff but you will need to size up at least two sizes.  as the previous reviewer stated these jeans do run extremely small.  i usually wear a 27 ag in jeans, sometimes a 28 for the ag legging jeans but the 28 in these were still very tight all over, and uncomfortable.  i don't like my jeans skin tight so i had to go up to a size 29 but they fit and look great.  sizing definitely off on these.  i am 5'3"" 115# for reference.",5
I bought this dress in a medium petite. i'm 5'2 and 140#. it fit great and made my waist look really tiny. i cannot wait the dress with heels or else you would see the entire shoe. it works perfect with flat sandals. i've received tons of compliments! you can also wear a normal bra with the dress. love it!,5
"A must have 1 piece. every time i wear this i get compliments! it's very flattering, amazing quality, soft material, good support and vibrant colors! i wish this came in more colors and patterns. worth the money no questions asked!",5
"I adore this maxi! the fit, style, pattern (black motif), machine washability, everything! fits tts (got my usual size s for 5'7"", 125lbs). i would say that the length is appropriate - some are super long on me, and i'm not one to wear heels. i was also happy that the top fits nice and snug - my issue is usually that when i bend forward the top drapes open due to my small chest - no problem with this dress! i think it's perfect piece for spring/summer/fall and dressing up or down. my one slight",5
I ordered this after reading the stellar reviews and i was not disappointed! i ordered the black and purple floral motif and both are excellent. i have a rather big chest (36dd) and the shelf bra and halter support are just enough for me. look forward to wearing this on my upcoming vacation!,5
"This skirt is great! the fabric is so soft and light. i was hoping that the lower portion of the skirt wouldn't be too transparent, and it wasn't. the slip lining on the upper portion of the skirt is nice. the color is exactly as shown. i followed the advice of the only reviewer and sized up... i shouldn't have! the skirt was too big in the waist and too long. so i exchanged and the fit was right on. i think the skirt is meant to sit a little higher on the waist, so keep that in mind. the only t",5
"Love this black and white dress. the bottom art print is so nice, i am a sucker for flowers, i also love the cut of it, teh tiered hem is very flatering, not too much amterial. the upper part covers a normal bra, and the whole dress is super flowey, substantial amterial, and stretchy (for those days where you ingest more than itnended). flattering cut (waist being the aame apttern as the bottom, gives it a nice shape). i can't say anything bad about this. 

regular xs fit me but i would ahve t",5
This is such a simple dress to throw on that will give you instant wow factor. you can dress up or down but know that it is completely flattering - head to toe. i am in love with this dress!,5
"Great petite maxi! i'm 5'3 and it skims the top of my feet. soft, fits great and went right into my suitcase for my upcoming  trip. can dress up or down.",5
"I was on the fence about getting this maxi because it's a tad pricey but ended up scoring an retailer coupon that took a bit of the sting out of the price. i'm so glad i went ahead and ordered it! it's absolutely lovely! i'm 5'3"", 117# and got an xs petite; it fits like a glove and is the perfect length to wear with either flats or a higher heel. love, love, love!",5
I wouldn't be so unhappy if these pants cost about 75% less. they are so cheaply constructed. one wash and they're all but guaranteed to shrink. the material is so cheap and flimsy not at all what i expect from retailer. they are also 32 inch inseam not 35.5 as stated on the web site which is the whole reason i bought them.,1
Very comfortable and easy to dress up or down. i get tons of complaints on this dress- it's a definite win!,5
"I ordered this dress online and i love it! i'm only 5'2"" so it's always a challenge for me with maxis but this one fit the bill. not too much fabric to be overwhelming on a shorter frame and the length was perfect. the fabric is very comfortable and moves with you. also the quality is great! i ordered a small petite but i probably could have gone xs petite. this would dress would be flattering on most people. need same dress, more colors!",5
"This dress is beautiful and fit exactly as pictured. i'm 5'9"", 140 lbs and a size 4 fit perfectly.",5
"This dress is very forgiving on my post baby body. i'm glad i purchased the petite, it hits my ankle perfectly (i'm 5'5""). very versatile, i can see wearing this at work (with a blazer) or on a weekend.",5
"This is my new favorite dress! i can't tell you how flattering it is. i just had a baby a few months ago, and it's the only piece of clothing i actually feel like i look like my old, pre-baby self in! i'm on the shorter side (5'3""#, very busty #because i'm nursing# and about 118 lbs. i got a mp and it fits great. i could have gotten the small, but i feel that would have been too low cut. honestly, love the cut, the pattern, everything about it. would buy again!",5
"I love my new maxi dress! as soon as i put it on, i knew this dress would be my go to dress of the summer. i love the styling with the thicker shoulder straps and higher cleavage. you will definitely be able to wear a regular bra with this dress. the material is soft, light, and flows well. i particularly love the ruffle on the bottom of the dress - it adds that extra little feminine touch. i can't wait to wear it.",5
"I love this dress! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish, but are also very comfortable... this dress fit the bill. the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online, and the fabric is so soft, it almost feel like wearing pajamas. the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely, and so it's flattering. overall, a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe.",5
This is a great dress for summer and very flattering!  i am 5'4 and could have pulled off the regular length but chose to go with the petite so that i could wear flats.,5
This dress is beautiful. the neckline is not too low and the straps are wide enough so you can wear a normal bra! the waist is very flattering and the ruffle at the bottom is not too much. i am short so i ordered the petite and it is a perfect fit. now i just need some warmer weather!!,5
"One of the best maxi dresses i have ever found! i needed a dress that could accommodate a large bust (36g) and camouflage my postpartum belly. the dress did it all. i ordered the large (5'7 and 155 lbs) and it is so flattering. it has just the right amount of coverage up top to prevent looking too busty. and the band around the midsection makes me look much slimmer. like i said, best maxi dress ever. price is pretty high, but it was worth it!",5
"I love this dress. i live in maxi dresses versus shorts in the summer and this is the perfect cut, weight and quality. i did have to order it in petite or else i was stepping on the bottom (unless really high heels). i am 5'5"", so i would say that it runs long. offer this cut in more colors!!",5
"This dress is extremely comfortable and looks great on. i'm 5'3"" and 34dd and the m petite fit like a dream with even a bit of room at the bust. the length is perfect with sandals or even up to 2-inch heels. perfect for travel and summer entertaining!",5
"I was on the fence about purchasing this dress for a while and finally took the plunge. glad i did because this dress is stunning and very comfortable. i ordered an xsp and it was the perfect length. originally, i had also considered xxsp. while it fit well above the waist, it was slightly too short. for reference, i'm 5 ft 3.5 inches, 105 pounds.",5
"This dress is wonderful. wide enough straps for a bra to be concealed, lovely pattern that draws the eye down instead of across, and a waistband that hits at the narrowest part of your midsection, making it look super-tiny. the design is simple but very clever--it's feminine, flattering, and slimming. my only quibble is that it's quite long (and i'm almost 5'7"" in my stocking feet)...i will have to wear heels or have it hemmed. highly recommend.",5
These are so comfy! mom of two boys on the go! great for running around and then can be dressed up for a night out on the town! not mom jeans!,5
"Took the plunge and ordered this in the romantic floral pattern. i almost got the black because i thought it would be 'timeless' but the print is so fun - i'm glad i went with it! ordered a size m - for reference, i am 5'6, 135lbs, 34c, 28/39 and the fit is comfortable. i don't need a lot of support :) and i find the coverage adequate up top and on the bottom. i think it'll still fit perfectly even if i lose a few pounds before my beach trip. this is the first one-piece i've had since i was a gi",5
Another perfect maxi from retailer! the print is feminine and can be easily dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my normal size in maxis (medium) and the top fits nice and snug but not too tight. i am busty and the neckline is high enough that i don't feel like i am showing too much cleavage. it is a little long on me when i have flip flops on but with a little platform sandal it will be perfect.,5
"Love this skirt. i love that it is pleated and sheer on the bottom. i'm so happy i found it online! love anything maeve, you can count on the quality and simple elegance.",5
"Gorgeous dress with a slimming pattern and flattering waistband. i would say the bust cups are a little floppy on the medium petite and i have 36dds. like others, i wish the skirt was lined but it's not a deal breaker. tracy reese did a great job creating movement in the skirt and flounce without the bulk. i can wear a little heel but wearing flats makes the hem drag.",5
Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't be happier! she's a size 4/34c and the small fits perfectly and is so flattering and comfortable. highly recommend.,5
"As other reviewers have said, this is the perfect summer maxi dress! i'm tall, just under 6 feet, and while the dress could be just a bit longer it still works for my height. i do wish the skirt was lined, but other than that the dress is excellent. worth buying at full price if you're worried about it selling out!",5
"I can't get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit, to the colors and pattern, to the design, and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion, a great price for a versatile, high quality dress. the material is that super comfy, stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. also, the neckline is flattering and sexy without showing ""anything""! definitely can wear a normal bra",5
This dress is so easy to wear! the neck line is not too low! can wear a regular bra!! it flows beautifully! i love it!!,5
"This dress is so much prettier in person - the pattern is unique, adorable and not over-powering. i'm an xxs petite and i can wear the dress with flats. (5ft) i think this is versatile enough to wear to work, party or a casual wedding. the fit is perfect - hugs at the correct spots. the fabric feels really soft and silky and feels a bit heavy which allows it to drape nicely. overall - i love it.",5
"I'm on the smaller end of the bust spectrum even nursing i'm a 32c/d at my fullest. i adore this suit. there is zero support so if you need that move on don't buy this. i love it -hides the post partum baby puff, pattern detracts from flaws, deep plunge is modest yet still sexy and it's super stretchy and easily be pulled aside to feed a baby. underneath there's a fabric bra insert so if you bend over nothing can be seen which i like. haven't worn in water or waves yet but fabric feels awesome.",5
"This is the perfect dress to take traveling. dress it up with heels or down with sandals. warm up and wear it with a short black sweater. a nice easy elegant dress. size small fit nicely, medium probably would have been fine too.",5
"This is a really nice suit. it fits well and is slimming with the cross waist. it's also supportive in the bust even, and maybe especially, because it doesn't have moulded cups or underwire, which allows for flexible sizing. the back rises high enough that it supports around the chest as well as from the halter straps. the straps are wide too so they don't dig in and are comfortable. the look is subtle and feminine in the black and the quality is good. it is true to size, but might run a tad lar",5
Beautiful in every way. you can never go wrong with black and white. very lightweight since it's not a lined dress so it's perfect for our florida heat.,5
"The ""movement"" in these culottes when i walk makes me feel like i should have some, ""yeah, i can wear these attitude!"" not only is the quality exceptional but the fabric is ""thick"" enough to hide flaws. i am 5' 120 lbs and i ordered the 4petite. i am usually a 6petite. the size 4p fits perfectly. i ordered the apricot color. great neutral. i'm so happy i was able to get a pair -there's a reason most sizes are sold out! i have short legs, and my legs are medium in size. i worried about the thigh",5
"This maxi is perfect! the neckline is sexy but not too sexy (yay for normal bra!), and the waistline is flattering. the skirt isn't very full, but the ruffle effect at the bottom gives it nice movement. it could easily be dressed up or dressed down. i can't imagine that this wouldn't be flattering on anyone. it fit totally true to size for me.",5
"This is a fantastic maxi -- it is very flattering, you can wear a normal bra with it (for me, very necessary) and the added ruffle makes it perfect. its a casual fabric but because of the contrast in fabric can be dressed up easily. 

i am 5 foot 1, 123, and curvy on top and ordered a small petite. in many antrho maxis i go down to an xs, but in this one the small felt the best -- more comfortable around the waist. 

will get tons of wear out of this -- have already taken it on a trip and wo",5
"I really love everything about this cardigan. the detailing at the bottom part of the arms adds a lot, the color is highly versatile, it is a thicker fabric so it keeps you warm, and my favorite part is that it is long. i like longer cardigans that you can easily pair with skinny jeans. the only drawback is there is no way to close this cardigan, likely if i end up purchasing this i will also purchase some sort of broach to pin it with or pair it with one of the belts i have from retailer to",5
These are just as cute as pictured. they are generously sized made from soft denim. the denim has quite a bit of stretch. i ordered a size down from my normal size. i was surprised by all the extra threads in the pockets. they were still attached to the inside of the pockets. it just made them feel a little unfinished. these didn't impact the overall wear or appearance of the garment. the straps are adjustable with two buttons on the overalls and three strap-length adjustments on the straps. the,5
"Love this shirt...got it in the ""blue"" but i will say the print is a very dark navy, almost black. i'm 130 lbs, 34d and the size 6 fit me fine. so i would disagree with other reviews that says it runs large. this is perfect to hide muffin tops with the slight swing style that has a little flair!",5
"Let me just say the ski pattern is the cutest thing i've ever seen!! i literally bought it as soon as a saw it. i got a size 2. i'm usually a 0 or 00 in most blouses and shirts, but i wanted this to be a litter looser so i sized up. it's definitely not oversized even though i sized up. the fit is a little boxy and a little shorter in the front - really flattering in my opinion. the material is really nice and it can definitely be dressed up for work or dressed down with jeans and a chunky scarf!",5
Absolutely beautiful!! quality is worth it...i agree with other review and also sized down from large to medium for a more fitted look ....the color is gorgeous..lighter shade of brown...so thrilled material does not contain dreaded wool lol!,5
Beautiful stitching on the sweater. very soft and a nice length as well. like the soft brown color - will match many things in my wardrobe.,5
"This runs sooo big! i normally wear a large ( 145lb, 5'-4"", 36dd) but due to the limited sizing small or medium i chose small because it looked big on the model and this style of dress seem to run large. the size small that i ordered couldve fit two people easily together! i loved the pattern, color and the slip underneath actually fit well but i dont want to look like im wearing a tent, lol. also, the back is slightly longer than the front, something i couldnt see from the pictures online.",1
"I am partial to maeve tops, i love the prints! i loved the ski print as soon as i spotted it. i think its such a darling shirt for winter. the material is light weight which is perfect for layering, i'm planning on wearing it with my fur vest as well as a knit vest i got at retailer last summer. i got a 4 (i go between 2 and 4) because i prefer some room in button down shirts and it fits as planned. i wanted to wait for it to go on sale but i was worried about selling out so i picked up on black f",5
What a sweet shirt!! the ski pattern is adorable and they have a cute cat pattern that i've only seen so far in the store. the fit is small. i sized up from my normal 8 to a 10 but could have even gone to a 12 as there wasn't much difference between the 10 and the 12 except in length.,5
Bought with the 25% off retailer was running -- usually a little skeptical of maeve regarding size but the material of these shirts is excellent. bought the ski print and the red penguin print. perfect for low-key and where i work!,5
"High quality, soft, thick fabric that drapes well, keeps you warm, and figure flattering. i'm 5'4 and the length is perfect. the color is a great neutral that goes well with everything. love the design detail throughout. this cardigan does not have a button or tie closure so if you are between sizes, go with the smaller size for a tailored fit.",5
"I tried this on in the sotre (in balck) as i was planning on ordering the orangey one.

my usual is 0 or 2, sometimes petites. i thought the regular 0 was sjut fine and flattering. fabric is soft, adn every pattern they ahd in store was really nice (no orange-red though). was not overly snug anywhere, and i am a bit braod for my size.

i deceided not to purchase only because i have done seriosu damage in the last month *multiple purcahses) and this was one of 2 i had to pick... if it goes on sal",5
"This is the second sweater i've purchased recently that i overlooked online, but fell in love with once i tried it on. it is extremely flattering and the length is perfect. i will be wearing this a lot! i am 5'-7"", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly.",5
"I seldom buy prints and almost never buy a traditional button front blouse but this shirt is my favorite purchase of the season. i chose the skier print as it was whimsical and subtle. rather than wear it buttoned and tucked i use it as a jacket over solid tees. i bought it a size larger for this reason. i like the layered look and the fabric is flowy and drapes nicely. i have been so pleased with every piece of ""maeve"" clothing i have purchased. once again thinking slightly outside my comfort-z",5
"This top was a big disappointment. i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well, but one was cut much smaller than the other. i've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops. i don't understand why in size 14 & 16, this keeps happening. that's why i purchase two of each. usually one fits and the other doesn't. this time, unfortunately, neither worked. they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders",1
"Tried this on in the store in a small (i'm a size 6 in most retailer dresses) and it was enormous. i'm short (5'2"") so i knew i'd need a petite size. ordered a petite small and the length is better - still a lot of fabric, but i think a petite xs would be too small if you are curvier up top (i'm a full 34d and the petite small is just slightly tight in the bust). definitely size down in this or you'll be swimming in it!",5
I loved this top so much i ended up getting it in three colors. it's comfortable and so easy to wear. it does run large though in my opinion. i normally wear a 6 in tops and i bought this is a 2.,5
"I love this shirt! i got the one with the skiiers. for reference, i got a size 2 and i'm 5' 6"", 135 pounds. it's a bit tight around my shoulders, but not enough to make me want a size 4. if you have broader shoulders, a 4 would probably be good. the bottom flares out a little and is cut shorter than other button downs. it's too short to really tuck in comfortably. the print is absolutely perfect. the shirt is soft and very flattering. it's pricey but super cute!!",5
"I purchased this online and absolutely love this:::: it can be dressed up or down. i received many compliments, its also so soft and very comfortable!!! a must have!!",5
"I had been looking for something like this to add to my summer wardrobe. fortunately for me i saw these in the retailer catalog and thought, how perfect, exactly what i've been searching for. they are a bit pricey, and crotch hangs a bit lower on me because i'm only 5'3, but it's not enough to make me send them back, i will have them altered if need be, they are to cute. 

i'm a size 4 in pants and ordered the 29, i wanted some wiggle room, i didn't realize the denim has stretch, i will keep the",5
"Must have - i splurged on the white style and red style; couldn't choose between the two. shape of shirt worked for me. the white style isn't too thin that you have to wear something underneath. costly for the quality of fabric, but i had a gift card, and it is retailer after all.",5
"These are worth the money! gorgeous fit, soft denim, and make my body look long and sleek (especially my bottom). i wear mine w a white tee underneath and plan to add booties for the fall but for now, platform clogs. fabulous.",5
"I bought this for my sister. it is perfect for your favorite cat lover, the print is adorable up close but not overwhelming to secretly hide your crazy cat lady intentions. i love this myself, the material is soft and it's a perfect flowy blouse for day to night.",5
"I think this romper is super stylish, kind of dvf-ish and it's as-pictured except it's more colorful in person; the vines are pink and pale aqua, and the flowers are deeper yellows with white & beige parts and pink dots in them. i see what other reviewers mean that the fabric is thin, it is, but i wouldn't say sheer. it's a lightweight woven fabric. the problem is there's no stretch, so when you reach up, the whole romper hikes up. i think it's true-to-size. i got my usual xspetite and it fits g",5
"I am writing this because my experience with this blouse differs from that of the other reviewers. compared to all my other maeve blouses, this top fits true to size/slightly larger than usual. it's wider/boxier than it appears online, and the arms are totally normal (in fact quite roomy) on me. all the other reviewers thus far have complained of very tight arms/bust and had to size up. i am having the opposite dilemma... given the extra width due to the cut of the blouse, and the fact that the",5
"Great shirt!! i bought the red penguins and its adorable. i am returning it however b/c the size i bought was too big, with that said it was my error not the brand. i think it runs true to size.",5
"I purchased the blue stripes and the black cat prints on sale and i'm very pleased. they each fit me a little differently as the black cats fit tighter through the arms, the stripes remain a bit looser throughout. no complaints here! i like the variation. i ordered a size small as i'm normally a size small (36c, 135 lbs, 5'2"").",5
"My new favorite sweater for layering!! perfect color, length and fit. i am 5""4, 125 and purchased my usual small. if you're on the fence about this one i say try it on it's totally worth it!",5
"So, i'm really surprised that reviewers said the fit was too small and too tight in the arms. i'm 5'7"" and 183lbs and my husband (god bless his soul) bought me an 8 for my birthday. i tried it on just to see and was pretty impressed i could button it across my chest and get it over my arms as those are common problem areas for me. regardless i need to exchange the shirt for a larger size because even though i got it on its not how is supposed to look. the shirt is loose around the midsection whi",5
"Beautiful angel of the north sweater! tts, lovely color and a staple classic.",5
"When i saw this shirt it bought back wonderful memories of ice skating on wheatley's pond as a child where i primarily grew up in the northeast. just loved it!! i tried my normal size 4 on but it fell off my shoulders and the cuffs fell mid hand so, i tried the size 2 and it fit perfectly. i see where many say it runs small and for full busted ladies it may but i am only 34b and 116 lbs and the size 2 worked fine. it is slightly blousey in the mid section but not overly so, the fabric and stitch",5
"Great blouse for curvy women. i'm always an xl in retailer tops, and even then sometimes the xls can be too tight to keep. however, i was so happily surprised with this blouse. the arms are usually an issue for me, but the arms in the blouse are perfect and loose in the bicep area. this blouse fits beautifully and is really high quality. the blouse lays nicely everywhere. i plan to wear it with a pair of gray pants so the lace cut out at the bottom shows up more. the lace is heavy duty and doesn't",5
"Great sweater, beautiful detail, warm and cozy. i will wear this well into spring because it's a nice weight for cool spring evenings. the knit pattern is beautiful and will be great for casual wear and dressy occasions as well.",5
The straps are long but work ok for me. the material is very soft and the color (pink) is very nice. this is a tank you can wear under almost anything as the soft silky fabric will allow whatever you wear to glide right over it....no sticking!,5
Wanted to love this colorful romper. the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking. no way would i wear this.,1
I bought this shirt in the black cat print. the material is very soft and it has a nice drape. i wear a size 32dd and worried that the size zero may be too small across the bust but it fits perfectly. i am 5 feet tall with a petite frame. the front of the shirt falls a few inches below my waistline and the back of the shirt is longer and provides plenty of coverage so it can be worn with skinny jeans. i can also wear this to work with a pair of slacks and it looks nice. i would actually love to,5
"I am somewhat of a perennial sale-only retailer purchaser (often even when a promo code, i don't buy full price! lol!). when i saw this top i decided it was worth it. i got the penguin print - my 2-year-old squealed when she saw me pull it out of the box! thanks, retailer, for your woodland-inspired prints that enamor my little one.

maeve tends to run big, so i went with the 00. in my opinion, it fits true to size. i probably would have liked it just a little bigger, maybe the 0 would have been bes",5
I love these so very much! by far my favorite addition to my wardrobe this summer. i find they are the first thing i grab because i feel wonderful in them. they fit perfect even with a large bust which i was afraid i would not be able to pull off....but very tastefully do. i highly recommend these and i plan to wear them into the fall with boots and long sleeve t-shirt. worth every penny. if your size is available grab them...you will be happy you did.,5
"I had my eye on the skier blouse for awhile before i gave in to the purchase. love it for fit and graphics - those happy little skiers! i think many reviewers here don't realize this blouse has the cut of a swing style. it's not meant to be tailored for tucking in. if you want to tuck it you'll be wearing a high-waisted skirt or pant, cute also ;-)

Such a cute top! i got the black with tiny car faces on it. absolutely adore it.,5
"Beautiful bohemian maxi that feels like soft woven cotton/poly but it's unfortunately viscose. the print is as vibrant & detailed as expected from hemant & nandita. color contrast not as bright irl. body of dress flares out to an a-line after the arm holes and the hem is a shark bite to show off your footwear. there is no lining, but it doesn't seem see through. very relaxed fit that feels tts but if you prefer a slimmer cut and are of slender body habitus, size down. otherwise, if you are busty",5
"I purchased the gray motif with the bright flower design. i have owned many blouses in my lifetime, but i must say this is one of the best fitting and most attractive of most any i have ever owned. it falls just right on my body and is smooth and luxurious with a silky feel. the cuffs fall on my wrists just perfectly. the color is just right for my fair skin and light hair. this was my first order from you and if this is any indication of the quality and fit i will receive i'll do a lot more ord",5
Super comfortable..great layering piece or by itself...got lots of compliments at work.,5
"I love this shirt, very comfortable and has a nice drape. i originally bought the size i normally wear but found it to be a little tight across my chest, so i returned for the next size up.

very well made and not sheer so did not have to wear a tank underneath.",5
I'm so glad i tried this dress on to see how lovely it is. definitely a keeper!,5
"I am in love with this top. it is so feminine and cute. i wear it with skinny jeans and tall boots and feel so pretty!! i got the cream color. i wish there were more solid colors. i usually wear a medium, which is what i ordered, and i love how it fits. i like flowy tops so it is perfect. please make solid colors!!!",5
"What a wonderful find! yes, it runs big. .. and beautiful! love the quality, and design. very light and airy. this is great for me because i'm not short & i am busty & i love tunics. this item can be dressed up or played down with class. the lining is a perfect complement to the tunic as well and fits nice with the garment. i am usually to busy to write a review, but i felt obligated on this item. five stars!",5
Just got this shirt in the mail and i am absolutely in love! i paired it with jeans and brown boots and got so many compliments. the shirt is light and flowy. it very flattering for any body shape.,5
The dress runs big you should size down. i find the weight to be great for mild winter weather. the length was longer than i expected based on previous reviews.,5

Love this white jean jacket! love the stretchy fit.,5
"I ordered the purple in size xl. the fit on me matches the model so i think it's true to size. i wouldn't say there's much purple to this print. i can't really find any. the areas where the blue/red overlap just look navy. the photos show how it really looks. it's a great mix of light brown, peach, white, red and different shades of blue. there will be variations because of pattern placement. i love this style--it's very comfortable.",5
This top is simply amazing! it's a statement top everyone should own! the green is so rich and full of life! and the floral pattern is just beautiful!! i got so many compliments on it and i felt like a million bucks! confident and trendy! love love looovvveee this top!,5
Got the green one,5

"I stumbled upon this as a return to our store. at first, i was a little put off by the change in stitching to add support and shape. but once you put it on, it's perfect. it's very flattering and very comfortable. there are snaps in the crotch, but i wore it for a full day (8+ hours) and had no discomfort. if there were more colors, i'd buy them all lol.",5

"I am 5'7"" and 36a cup. i tried on the small and it fits perfectly. i can see how if i was bustier it could be a problem. it looks better in person, dressy enough for the office but comfortable fabric and nicely shaped. i love this with jeans and can't wait to wear it to work!",5
"Fun, flowy top! maybe be a little snug across the top for larger chested girls but this flares out into a light and airy dream to wear!",5
I love this shirt! it was a great price and very high quality. it has different material stitched in the inside,5
I wore this bodysuit once. it had a hole under the arm when i took it off,1
This sweater is a nice addition to a fall or spring wardrobe. it must be layered as it is sheer. i read a review about snagging but i have not had this issue as of yet.,5
This bodysuit will be a staple for me this winter. i wear it own its own and under just about everything. i just ordered another one!,5
"This dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. it has a forgiving a line shape to it for women like me who are pear shaped. the top of the dress is made of a heavy type of cotton material and the bottom tiers are made of a silky material that hangs beautifully! even the tie closure in the back of the dress adds a lovely touch to the dress. i would recommend wearing it with leggings ( as shown with the model) or black tights. the fit is true to size. i am 5'6"" and the length is a liittle low",5
I purchased my normal size small. i loved the colors in the purple which are more blue and vibrant red to me. this top is a nice soft fabric. it will pair nice with denim jeans.,5
"This shirt looked plain online, but when i see it in store, i thought it's so pretty! it is the over-sized style, when i tried it on, it's so flattering, even though it is over-sized but it doesn't make you look chunky at all! i got it while it was on sale with extra 25% off! i range from 2 to 6, xs, s for retailer sizes. i got a xs for this top.",5
"Love this dress so much, i bought the checkered, and then had to go back for the black! it is so worth the price. i wear it with sandals in the warm weather, and a blazer with boots in the cooler weather. it is beautiful and so flattering.",5
This top looks even better in person! the green is a little brighter than the photo. this beautiful blouse is silk with a sold underlining. it is very full and has great flow and movement. super trendy with the open shoulders and a nice long sleeve for fall. it's really beautiful and perfect for any festive occasion!!,5

So beautiful! i got the xs and it fits tts! it goes with everything! perfect weekend addition!,5
This top turned out to be better than expected! i'm a large girl and the length is enough to cover my hips and the shirt it not tight at all. the embroidery details are lovely too. i bought this for a trip to italy this summer because it is cotton and because i consider it to be a classic piece being that it is black and white. one nice feature is this top does not have to be worn off shoulder. it looks just great with the sleeves up.,5
"I love the pattern and flowy design.  i also like the peach liner but i will use that on other outfits i own and replace it with a slip that has a designed hem.  this top is too long for me to wear as a top. so i will wear as a dress with the a longer slip.  i'm hoping that the sequins will remain intact for the most part as the construction of everything is too delicate.  bought the size s and i am 6'3"" 140# 39-28-35.",5
"Good job retailer for getting the color representation spot on! the blue is so vibrant and the cashmere knit is so soft and comfortable. the dress is oversized but a little too much so. i recommend sizing down to get that ideal slouchy drape, otherwise you may overwhelm your frame with too much fabric.",5
"This is my third pair of ag primas - i love them! the higher rise is nice to keep smooth lines, they're made of such soft material that moves with you rather than restricts you, and the cut of the legs is skinny without being skin tight. absolutely my favorites jeans - retailer, sell more washes and i'll buy 'em!! :)",5
I bought this in black and the checkered pattern. love both. very floaty and feminine. fits true to size.,5
"When i saw this online, i knew i'd have to order it fast--it's just gorgeous. i got it in the mail today and couldn't be happier! i'm usually xs in angel of the north sweaters and this was no exception- it fit great. colors are as pictured.",5
"This top is so darling, the different textures are so elegant that you really don't even need to accessorize. it has a very flattering cut and a must for any figure.",5
"A mango beauty that resonates the color of blossoms in bloom. comfortable, effortless, and charming. i wear a size small in retailer dresses and this one fit true to size for me. tried the xs since reviews mentioned it ran large, but too tight across my average chest. looks great with denim jacket and red suede strappy sandals. also worn with a belt to accentuate waist.",5
"Amazingly soft, thin and super warm! this a classy staple with an amazing swing fit and worth every penny!",5
"There's no doubt that this tee is sheer. i found that a nude bra is sufficient in overcoming the issue. the fit is true to size, with just enough room for drape without being too oversized. the beachy theme will be perfect come warm weather!",5
"I like the top without the fake fur collar. when the collar is removed the neckline's shape is really nice. the collar seems cheap. i thought the sweater ran true to size. i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs. a small was a good fit although higher armholes would have made the whole thing fit better through the rib cage. it was loose there, but necessary looseness for layering anything underneath.",5
"Wonderful fabric, drapes nicely from waist= flattering, use for air travel as not too heavy in weght. beautiful charcoal grey goes with all colors. nice addition to tight, patterned pants & boots. dress up or casual",5
"This will be a 3 season dress for me.. its well made, comfy and flattering . the suede skirt is risky i know .. but i'll be sure to put the napkin in my lap!",5
"I ordered a size xl in the mango. the fit on me matches the model for the most part so i think it's true-to-size. it looks like it's intended to have a loose, flowier fit throughout the dress. the only confusing part to me is the model is listed as being 5' 9"" and i'm under 5' 6"" yet the length is the same. it fits me at knee-length too. i thought it would hit a little longer based on the model's info for the photos and getting the regular sizing. the one thing i wish was different is to have it",5
"I get a lot of compliments on this dress, it's bright and cheerful for sure! it runs maybe a bit large but is a great summer dress!",5
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful. the design and organza are so feminine, and i love the length. it flows beautifully and it isn't stiff or anything, but it does hold its shape well. i ordered it through the store, and the wrinkles came out easily after it hung for several days. i think it would be easy to snag the material, so i will be really careful when i'm wearing it. the zipper is a little hard to pull all the way to the top of the skirt, and i worry a little about the hook and eye closu",5
"Love this dress!! the vibrant color and lace details are just beautiful. can be dressed up or down. the only concern i have is that the straps are thin and delicate, but i'll just have to be careful when hanging it up.",5
"This yellow/mango color is so beautiful in person. i actually don't have the best skin tone for shades of yellow, but i couldn't resist trying this one on & it turned out to be perfect! the silhouette is very feminine, especially around the neckline & shoulders. there is a lot of fabric, but i actually appreciate that the dress is substantive. finally, the nicest thing is that the dress can easily be dressed up or dressed down depending on how you accessorize it. looking forward to summer!",5
I love this sweater coat;! it's so nice and fits well. would look great with jeans or a skirt. the collar is adorable! have already worn it and received compliments! i love retailer :)!!,5
"I found this to fit really well and i've got a chest, and the hourglass to go with it. the stretch really helps it to be comfortable too. i reckon it's pretty versatile too.",5
This sweater is much more beautiful in person. the quality is very good and the fur is nice too!! i am 5'8 inches and 155 lbs and the medium fit me perfect.,5
This sweater is very nicely made...i got a lot of compliments the first time i wore it. it's a light sweater and looks great with jeans! love it,5
"This sweater is lovely! i have worn it every other day since i got it. it is soft and warm and elevates everything that you wear it with. i have gotten compliments every time i've worn it. my daughter, who rarely likes the style of clothes i wear, said i looked like a winter princess in this! it is so flattering and comfortable---a winning combination!",5
"Comfortable but if you put in the dryer, even on low it will shrink a little so beware",5
"This is a unique color, and a lovely dress. i have the yellow, and i didn't find that it ran large. it definitely has a loose, flowing fit, and you can wear with or without a belt for different looks. the pleated fabric near the waist does fit differently than the other fabrics, but i don't think it looks odd. you have several pictures of people wearing them, and you can see that it looks amazing on everyone!",5
I just received this in the mail today and haven't taken it off since! i feel like i should be in a romantic movie with a cute black dress under it. can definitely see myself getting a lot of use out of it. can not wait to wear it for the holidays!,5
"Great dress that can be dressed up for work day or even dressed down for a nice weekend day.
i have it in black but thinking of buying in the yellow/orange color too.",5
"Beautiful and classy- i love this! i'm 5'8""/125lbs/34b and my usual xs works great (could probably also have worn a s). i was a little worried it'd be scratchy and/or too structured, but it's soft and flattering. photos are accurate. would definitely recommend!",5
"I'll admit that i often believe you pay for the design aesthetics at retailer, but not necessarily the quality. however, this dress happily has both! the fabrication and lacework on this dress are beautifully made and the price tag fits. i do think the sizing is off; i'm 5'5"", 137, 34b and the medium (my usual size) was huge, small was still gaping under the arms, and xs fit perfectly. i haven't worn an xs in anything since middle school, ha! the banding at the bust does make it tight, so i can we",5
"I recently purchased this dress in the yellow, which is not advertised online, but glad i saw at the store because the color is vibrant but not too loud and really compliments my olive skin. the dress ran a little on the larger side so i had to size down. also, you will have to either wear a strapless bra or go without because you cant hide bra straps as this is more of a halter look. i'm 5'9"" and the length was perfect for me, will be able to wear with heels or flats.",5
This is a go with everything throw on sweater coat that is very soft and flattering on. the fit is true to size for a swing coat. being a heather black helps with the no show of lint. i will wear this no doubt for years to come. thanks retailer.!!!,5
"I wanted this dress in yellow from the moment i first saw it on instagram. i waited for it to be available online and once it was i ordered it. i am usually a size medium but sized down to a small petitie (5'5"") -- and the fit is off. i am a 34b so its too roomy in the chest. because i love everything else about this dress i am going to re-order in an xs petite but that will be two sizes down for me. not sure if it will fit. length was good. looks great with a dark denim jacket . the dress is li",5
"This skirt is a must have!! it is very classy, and the pockets are perfect for holding lipstick for a little refresher throughout the night. it is high quality and definitely worth the price. i paired this skirt with a more casual black top and some pearls for a fancy banquet dinner, and got a lot of compliments. comfortable and classy.",5
This is such a pretty dress. it will look beautiful in the summer with a tan and lace up sandals for a very effortless look. fits very fitted in the top and loose throughout yet still slimming. i am petite 5'2 about 105 pounds and for reference i went with the xxsp. it looks expensive and well made and the yellow color is stunning and cheery. the yellow will look beautiful on darker skin tones as well as lighter skin tones who have a warm undertone. if you are on the fence order it and you won't,5
"I'm 5'4 with an hourglass shape. i love this dress. it drapes nicely, the material won't be hot for summer and the color is perfect for my olive complexion.",5
"Don't detach the collar unless you like getting frustrated. i made the mistake of taking it off just to see what it looks like without it (cute) but reattaching was the biggest pain! i have pretty nimble fingers but stretching the little loops around the little buttons tested my patience to the limit. so other than that--buy this sweater if you get a chance. it's stylish, flattering, soft, versatile, etc, etc...",5
"I have a gala to go to wear i am a board member. i had been eyeing this dress online and tried it in store! lurve! i got the black one which is a black lace over a sheer cotton nude, i also got the regular when i am petite as it hit longer for a black tie event. i have a large bust at 5'2"" size d, but small and short torso and the large just hugged the girls just right. i love the it can be worn fancy with block heels to a gala or wit ha jean jacket or espradilles for a casual summer night. this",5
This sweater coat is so cute!! i agree with the other reviews it does run a little big. i always wear s tops from retailer....was a little hesitant to order this in a s since i would be wearing it over things....so glad i did the small is perfect so i would say it runs a little large. i do think it is is a little over priced but i did get it at 20% off and it was a treat for myself!,5
"This dress is gorgeous on the hanger and even more gorgeous on. definitely runs big though, so sizing down is probably best.",5
"As stated in my review title, they're amazing! they're incredibly well made, have just the right amount of stretch, and are so flattering. i think the boot cut makes them look like pants rather than leggings. they can definitively be worn to work, or at least where i work, where the dress code is business casual. my only issue is the length, which being at 5'3 isn't surprising. they're about 3 inches too long. i'm a size 8-10 and got the large. i couldn't recommend these enough",5
"I don't understand the negative review
on this sweater. it is nothing short of stunning. the quality and design are absolutely beautiful! and i love the lined pockets! i can honestly say i don't think i'll ever part with it - this is a sweater you hang onto forever. i will say it runs a bit large. i ordered the xs/sm and if i didn't know better i would think its m/l. either way if you can you get your hands on one in store or a return online, do it! it is worth every penny, especially for the s",5
"Ignore the nutty negative review because this sweater is beautiful and really looks like a hand knit sweater. the quality is excellent, with two side pockets that are lined. it's really soft and so comfy and thick. just perfect for my southern ca evenings all year long. 
so comfy you can wear it as a robe!
looks just like the photo; i got the m/l and it fits like an extra large, which i like in a bulky cardi.
super gorgeous! what a steal at the sale price.",5
"Retailer has great designs but sometimes they use cheap fabrics and are not quality made. this top is quality made and super soft. its a little thicker than a normal cotton t-shirt but thinner than a sweatshirt. i normally wear medium (34dd, 135-140 lbs, 5'4"") and this was tts. i got the blue and its a little bit darker in person. one big plus imo is that you can put it in washer and dryer, no need to line dry! i am going to buy the natural colored stripes one too. also, i bought the normal size.",5
I love the great variety of fabrics and textures used in these joggers - you will also!,5
"Love these pants, i am 5'2 and these fit in length nicely!",5
"I have a couple of pair of hei hei pants from last summer that i love and was so happy to see these. i am curvy (5'8"" size 8) and got these in a 30 and they fit perfectly in the hips and no gap at the waist. i love them so much that i bought a second pair. the only thing that could make them better is if they had a bit of stretch.",5
"I went to the store to buy the transcend verdugo ankle in blue. however,i left with it in blue and black. the black is perfect. absolutely amazing fabric that shapes your behind, and no ones is more imperfect than mine. i cant say enough about these except paige rocks! i'm a fan!!",5
"What a let down. the sweater i received in no way resembles the product pictured. based on the original price point, i envisioned a beautiful hand-knitted sweater made of high grade yarn/ wool that i could use for travel. instead, i received something that is grossly oversized for xs/s, made out of weird crafting yarn and looks like an ugly holiday sweater. my kids could make something better than this on their toy loom. not the quality i expected from retailer. back it goes.",1
"This is a simplistic beauty. the colors are lovely and as pictured. i believe it is tts but if your small busted you could probably go down a size. i personally stayed with my small and i lke the flow of it. the flannel has a nice weight to it so you can wear this fall, winter and early spring if you live in a cooler climate.",5
"This top is great and perfect for fall/winter. i've gotten a lot of wear out of this so far...great with jeans and sneakers for a casual look, or dress it up with black jeans and boots. great layering piece as well. the fabric is soft and comfortable. the fit is nice and relaxed, but tailored on the sides to give you some shape. the colors are beautiful.great buy, i highly recommend!",5
I was not going to purchase this jacket thinking it was too pricely but i am glad that i did. true to size and made with great craftsmanship. it looks very delicate but made strong. very pretty .... true too picture. it works out perfect for after yoga!,5
"This is a beautiful and versatile skirt. i love the layered detail, length, and flattering cut. 

the fabric is a 80% cotton/20% linen blend. it's a thick weave with tiny nubs here and there. the skirt was made in turkey.

i usually wear a size 4 in retailer skirts, but i sized down to a 2 in this skirt. the size 2 fit at my natural waist and looked as pictured on the model, whereas the 4 looked bulkier on me,",5
"I thought this would be a cute business attire skirt. i hate to say it, but i felt like it flared out as if i were amelia bedelia or some whacky children's book character and not retailer. the fabric made it look bulky. i sadly had to return it.",1
"Love the design of the fabric. i actually bought these in both colors. i gave only 1 star due stitching on the fabric, it's very scratchy.",1
"Beautiful dress! it looks fresh, feminine and the quality of the fabric is very nice.",5
"I bought this in my usual size small (i'm a 4-6, 27"" waist, 32b), and it fits perfectly. it's a little loose and boxy but still structured and cute (it fits me like the model). i don't find it itchy at all, and the embroidery is just gorgeous. this is perfect for transitioning from summer to fall!",5
"Picked this up end of season sale, but i go to florida a lot so i will still be able to use it. it runs a bit large. i'm usually between a s and m at retailer and i'm a bit heavy right now but the small fit loose and comfortably. i would recommend sizing down if you are between sizes. not itchy but i would wear a cami underneath because it is white and could start to itch after a while i suppose. it's definitely not a soft flowy t. mix of t-shirt material and linen. the main part of the t is cotto",5
"Wanted to buy this dress, but the bust area was way too small. as i went up sizes, the torso began to be too long, and i would have to have it altered, i guess. what a shame.
but, if you are small chested, then this is your dress.",5
"This cropped trouser is very high quality and perfect for summer. i ordered my usual size petite 4 (i am 5'2"" 115 lb) and i felt a little tight but since other previous reviews said they do stretch after wearing it, i decided to keep it. i hope they stretch out a little bit more. overall, i am very happy with my purchase.",5
I love the oversized look of this jacket--my building is kept freezing cold so while at work i am constantly fiddling with cardigans and scarves and a space heater to try to keep from freezing while working and i thought this jacket would be a great jacket that basically functions as a blanket while still looking professional. (my boyfriend doesn't quite get the 3/4-length sleeves but that definitely keeps the look of this jacket polished--if they were longer i think it would be too much just li,5
"The cut is on the boxy side and i'm not sold on the tiered effect, but i love the silk fabric and the print so much that i just don't care. the silk is deliciously light and breathable, and the print is neutral enough that i can pair it with several different cardigans and necklaces to mix it up. and the quality of construction is excellent--all of the seams were expertly sewn and pressed, and the print was lined up like in the online picture. given the material and construction quality, it's de",5
Well made dress. cute pleats - though a few didn't lie perfectly flat. it was a little too long for me (i'm 5'1) especially in the torso/straps area. also the armholes were a little large. fits tts,5
"I love this top, on me, it looks so flattering, the tie detail is really nice, and i love the white subtle details at the bottom and collar. i actually haven't seen the sleeves unrolled on me, i roll them up. the tie part is a little wrinkled from shipment, but who cares. i ordered the regular 0 as the petite have been sold out a longtime ago, i actually got this shirt a while back and thought i had already written a review... i am wearing it with boyfriend jeans right now (for casual friday and",5
"I live year round in warm weather and found these pants to be a great addition to my wardrobe. flattering and comfortable, the cropped look is a nice alternative to shorts. i'm 5.7 curvy but athletic.143lbs i usually wear an 8 or 10 in retailer but took the 10. i prefer my pants a little less fitted.",5
"This shirt totally exceeded my expectations -- the detail and colors are wonderful, and the shirt itself is quite comfortable. the shirt is a bit boxy, but there is enough structure and detail so that it looks quite flattering on. plus, it looks great with jeans or with a skirt -- it is very easy to style!",5
"I was looking for a basic black one piece suit that sucked in the tummy, but with style and a little flair. this is it! the ruching is perfect, the material is great and the separation of the straps at the top give it more style. i am usually a size 6, but ordered an 8 because i have a 34d chest. i was right on. the 8 covers the top with a small amount of cleavage and the bottom still fits because the ruching is a little tighter in the waist. i plan to wear this to the local pools this summer an",5
"I have had this dress in the shopping basket on my retailer app and was dying to try it on in the store. luckily, newbury street in boston had it so i stopped by yesterday. the dress is everything i hoped and even better! the cut could not be more flattering. to get the nice, classic fit in the front, i stayed true to my usual size (4) but worried the buttons would be straining like another reviewer said. as soon as the bow in the front is tied, it keeps everything together and is very comf",5
"I love this dress. it is super cute and comfy. i am 5'7 and a size small, 4 and 36c and i got this dress in a 4 and it fits great. a 2 might be a little more fitted on my waist but the 4 is comfortable and looks great. the length is perfect, not too short at all.",5
"This top is cute, light and summery. ordered a small...is a little short/boxy but otherwise fits true to size. great summer/warm weather top!",5
"Just too much cuteness! the print is amazing, the bow is darling, and the crisp structure keeps it from being too precious. looks amazing on my hourglass shape! runs a bit small--had to size up a bit and felt more comfortable once i put a piece of fashion tape in a spot that gapped a little. definitely worth the splurge!",5
Great with a tank top underneath and jeans. i also wore with a delicate gold necklace. charming!,5
"Love the pattern and material (not thick) for spring and summer.  like the fit and style. i'm 5'2"", 115#. i've purchased regular (not petite) front and side zip (with internal button) charlie trousers earlier this year and last year.  got a size 4 (i vary between size 2 and 4) in the front zip trousers and they stretched out and got a little loose after fitting perfectly.  so i got the side zip in size 2.  those were tighter initially and stretched out but are still snug.  with this particular p",5
"I have this shirt in more than one color! i totally disagree with the first review i find this shirt to be super comfy and unique! i personally feel the material isn't scratchy at all! also, i love this designer they are one of my new favorites!",5
"I love this top. it was cool on a summers day. i did get one of the strings of the design snagged but it worked out just fine, not ruined at all.",5
"I waited in anticipation for the turquoise version to appear online. turquoise and red can be found on another product page with the same name. 

size: i'm between small and xs for most retailer brands. i wanted this top to be a bit more fitted, so i ordered an xs. i'm 5' 5"" tall, 135 lbs, 35-29-36, 34d, with long torso and narrow shoulders.

fit: xs is spot on for me. i don't really mind the shorter length. it didn't appear to be too boxy. i layered a white shapewear tank underneath to help w",5
"I have this top with the red stitching and it is one of my most favorite items from retailer ever. i wear it with a tank top underneath so i haven't noticed any itchiness like the other reviewer mentioned. 
i wear it with slightly cropped slim boyfriend jeans and i get so many compliments every time i wear it.
i wish i had it in the blue color too!",5
"I started stalking this dress when i saw it on a store's instagram feed, and i was so thrilled to get it in the mail. however, i ordered it before reviews started popping up, and i was concerned it would not fit in the bust. however, when it arrived, the fit is perfect. it's not exactly loose in the bust, but there also isn't any pilling. the high-waisted nature was also suited to my shape. i'm usually between a 4 and a 6, and the 6 was great in this dress, and a perfectly joyful length--appropr",5
"When i first saw this too online i thought it was beautiful. i was right. when jt came in the mail, i really loved how the embroidery was intricate and detailed. the colors also popped making it a great shirt for spring, summer, or early fall.",5
Love love love. fits great. super comfortable and looks both casual and dressy at the same time. i could wear this every single day.,5
"I really like this shirt, and have gotten plenty of compliments the first time i've worn it.",5
This coat is wonderful! i am usually an xs-s in retailer and i got the xs. it is supposed to be a bit large. goes with everything and great quality.,5
"I was hesitant to buy but this tee is easy, light, and fun to wear.  the fabric is light but not see through in the slightest.  the construction is perfect.  it is tts for an oversized tee.",5
Cute and great fitting pant. love the pattern and it fit tts for the brand. i normally wear a 10/12 and i took at 12. flattering.,5
"As others mentioned, the arm holes are a bit large- but i didn't find this too much of a problem. possibly that's because as a smaller chested woman i run into that issue regularly. i'm 5' 4"" 130 and the size 8 fit perfectly. the length is at the top of knee.",5
Love this shirt! looks perfect with a pair of jeans! makes the outfit with out any effort!!!!,5
"Like the previous reviewer, my size 10p gaped and strained the buttons at my chest (36dd wide rib cage 5'3"" 140#). also the skirt flared out too high on my waist. i'm going to try a regular 10 with hope the torso will fit better. other than the fit on my particular body and the one distracting chest pocket, this shirt dress is very well made, very cute",5
"I wanted to give this top some love. i ordered this top and the kota peasant top with plans to only keep one of them. this top is definitely the winner. the neckline, sleeves, pattern, fabric, and length are gorgeous and flattering. it is very feminine and elegant and i think it will also be versatile....it could be very dressy (depending on what you wear it with) but it will also look great with jeans and shorts and sandals. it is a bit sheer so a tank or cami might be needed underneath. i orde",5
"This is a true retailer dress, cute and quirky. kudos for the built-in liner (with scalloped hem, very pretty) and pockets. i like the colorful yet subtle embroidered ice cream sticks on the dress, and the white background makes the colors and details really pop (pun intended!). i echo the previous reviewers that the bust is very small. i usually wear size 4 regular in this brand (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips. i?m 5?2?, and the bottom hem falls right at the upper knees). but when i tried on size 6,",5
"This is a fun and classic dress. the dress is well made, as others said, it doesn't have much ""give"".  i am a 36c, 29"", 39""- and the size 8 fit perfectly. i didn't experience any gapping between the buttons. it is a nice fun summer time dress! it is also very flattering!",5
"Great shirt, the material is lightweight without being see through. i didn't find the cut to be all that flattering, but it was a cute enough style and comfortable enough that i wanted to keep it. definitely see it becoming a staple in my closet.",5
I love this top. it's very comfortable looks great and the quality is very good. i've had many compliments on it.,5
"I saw this dress in the store and was drawn to the pattern as an alternative to my normal lbd. it looked okay on the hanger, but when i tried it on...wow! so pretty and chic. it actually hangs a little lower in the front on me than on the model pictured which adds to the chicness and makes it a sophisticated take on a kimono. (my husband's words) i wore it out that evening to dinner and received several compliments. i did not have any issues with fit. i am a size 6 and purchased a size 6. it fit",5
"Too tight in strange ways. beautiful dress i was so excited to receive it, however it just did not fit.",1
"It's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i can't wait for cooler weather. i tried it on with skinny jeans and it's darling. love how it's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum. perfect for leggings. nice slim, but not tight fit.",5
"I am a big fan of maeve tops. i love the beading and structure of this top. despite the fullness of the design, the fit is flattering",5
"I am a curvy girl with boobs! this dress was perfect. it hugged in all the right places and had room for my bust! i did go up a size...however, i normally have to do that anyway for the top to fit.

this dress is funky, and i look forward to wearing it with tights and boots in the winter, very comfortable. it has pockets!!!",5
"This was a disappointment because beautiful fabrics with interesting design are a rarity--and especially at this length! unfortunately, this is a mess in terms of proportions. if a size 2 can barely get it off, then there is a design flaw. sadly, the fit was so strange that it did not seem that simply sizing up would correct the flaws.",1
"I love that this tee is so soft and is not boring! when i originally took it out of the bag, my teenage daughter did not like it. then i tried it on and she was wowed! the longer length in the back makes it very interesting. i am looking forward to wearing this with jeans.",5
"Saw this one online and when it came it did not disappoint. i ordered a xxs in black, and it was perfect. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs. it definitely has a lot of volume to it, but i still found it flattering because the shirt is very sheer, so you can ""see"" through it to your thinner figure underneath. it comes with a comfortable but fitted camisole to wear under it, which makes it flattering. another reviewer mentioned the beading turning. i have not seen that on mine, but now i will be looking for i",5
"I love this item! . they hang & flow beautifully like the weightlessness of a silk skirt.
the front peek-a-boo cut outs really make them a delight to wear & show off some skin!
somewhat transparent,i topped it off with a lightweight tunic length for modesty... but the placement of the painterly design really works in my favor so i could wear them with something shorter if i choose to. (like the model)
heads turned as i walked by!",5
The print and front ruffle are beautiful. the sleeves are awful and poorly represented in the picture of the model. it's almost like the sleeves have a life of their own - so mismatched with this style of blouse. such a beautiful print but so disappointing in shape.,1
I bought this in black and i can already tell this is going to be a staple this fall and winter. the unusual hem and extra long sleeves are really flattering.,5
"I am a lover of jackets and coats; this is my new fave! 
great color, versatile (i.e. work, weekend). fun accent piece to shield yourself from a brisk wind, while maintaining full fashion status. 
my first day wearing and i've rec'd many compliments. love the combo of trench coat and poncho. my one issue...i wish the sleeve strap actually buckled, it keeps slipping out of the faux buckle and i'm afraid i'm going to lose it. i usually wear a medium/size 10, but medium was sold out, so i ordered",5
"I love the weight of this shirt and the open scoop neck. really flattering ...i wear tanks under my shirts anyway but it is see through. the weight is nice even in heat, and i expect it to be so nice layering in the winter. the cut at the hem is great..... very flattering and does not seem to cling.

i bought a white one, now i have repurchased another white (xs) and a black one. while i was vacillating, theblack xs sold out so i got a small and will cross my fingers that its not too big.",5
"What a disappointment and for the price, it's outrageous!",1
"I absolutely love this top, i purchase this brand frequently because the designs are simple, yet unique and cool. i'm 5'7"" 170 lb.s curvy/athletic and i got this in a medium, it fits perfectly and looks really great on! i love the asymmetric cut and raw hem... wish it came in more colors!",5
"I tried the xs in store and waistband is very stretchy and the material is lightweight (feels delicate) and to the floor. fell in love with the watercolor print. this would be great as a quick cover up over a bikini. beware- if you plan on wearing this anywhere besides by the beach, make sure to rock your nude undies because the cream color is super see-thru, which is my least favorite part of this piece. i couldn't get to the petites sizes before they all sold out, so i'm crossing my fingers th",5
"First of all, this dress is not cotton. it is 100% silk. it also not a pullover dress (it has a side zipper) and does not have an elastic waist like the description says. lastly, it is not by moulinette souers. i've really never seen a description so far off on one of the items pictured. nevertheless, it is a gorgeous dress. the silk is beautiful and can easily be worn for fall with a sweater or jacket. the waist is a little poofy and the chest is a bit snug. however, i was able to go down a siz",5
This shirt fits great. it is a fun look. i wore it wear a pair of leggings and sneakers for a casual day look. it goes down to my knees in the back and the front is asymmetric. so cute. i think i will get a lot of use out of this going forward.,5
"This shirt fits true to size. i love the cut of the shirt which adds some edge to a basic tee. i know i will wear this all the time throughout the fall and winter months. perfect to wear as is or layer with cardigans, jackets and scarves in cooler weather.",5
"Very pretty and comfortable. it was not obvious at my store that this was to go with swim suits. it was located next to regular pants, but once i tried it on - i realized it was somewhat see through. i still got it as its very lovely. i'm going on a beach vacation, so i know i'll use it over bathing suits. honestly i may use it with nude underwear or long shirts anyway, since its so different and pretty. i bought a large as i'm a 10-12 and its still pretty loose.",5
There's a reason the model is holding her arms up in all the frontal views. it hides the very weird wide top part of the sleeve that absolutely destroys and distorts an otherwise beautiful blouse. the print is lovely but the fit is very odd. it's pulls at and is very tight through the bust too. i wear medium or large and ordered size large. if you're less well endowed this might be an okay choice for you. but i have to say this blouse made me look overweight and very wide. returned.,1
"This dress is gorgeous. it is somewhat fitted but i didn't find it to run small. i am top heavy 36d and usually wear a size 10, but i bought this in an 8 and it fits me great. i will say the zipper is a bit tricky. at first i thought the dress was too tight but it turned out the zipper was stuck. after fiddling with it, i realized the dress fit but the zipper was a bit tricky. i wore it to work and got so many compliments. also the picture makes the background look burgundy but it is mostly blac",5
"I absolutely love this top!! i bought the ivory color, and i am definitely considering buying the black as well! it feels true to size, but i did size up only because i like my tops to fit a little generous and flowy. i can't wait to wear this top all season long!",5
"Finally, a white top that does not show every nook and cranny. this is a great fabric. many times white shirts are see thru and i won't buy them. this top is lightweight but has enough substance to cover everything. the online picture does not do it justice.
it can be worn with anything and is made very well. this one's a keeper for your closet and will be worn over and over all summer long.",5
"What a dress! the print, the feel of the fabric, and the overall fit of this dress, it definitely has the wow factor! i plan on wearing this dress to the kentucky oaks this year. i typically wear a 6 and sometimes a 4 in retailer dresses. i'm 5'6'' 130 lbs 32dd and took a 6 in this. i could probably even try the 8. it fit a bit tight in the bodice for me but i'm not sure if it warranted a size up. it is pricey but i see this being a closet staple and one of my favorite maxi's yet.",5
I love the print on these pants. they are beautifully flowy and flattering. the only downside is that they are see through so i'm going to take them to tailor to have a lining put in up to the knee so i can wear them to places other than the beach. i bought them on sale today in the store and bought a size small.,5
"This top is perfect for the first day at clown college if you want to see some clowns cry. the sleeves are probably the worst part of this overpriced monstrosity. the elastic at the cuffs makes the already comically large sleeves billow and puff out even more. 

buy this if you enjoy walking to the post office to return things.",1
Love this dress. fits true to size!! can be dressed up or down. very flattering1 prettier in person,5
The jeans are flatering and stylish. they are slightly distressed but will go with anything. the fit is like other pilcro stet pants i've purchased and loved.,5
"Have not worn them yet, but they are so soft and pretty. seems like a good item to travel with.",5
"Very flattering tee. nice details & quality.
my first time purchasing this brand, but will look for similar items from them.",5
"I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately, the material used for this particular jean is a far, far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.

don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.",1
"I reallllly love this sweater! i could wear it every day if i could. the sweater is comfortable, lightweight (but not see through) and versatile.",5
"I can't rate this with enough stars or numbers! great fit, can't see up the sleeve, perfect length, just right amount of fabric for draping. i am 5'3"" and 130lbs. fits like a dream and when i got it home from the store....it goes with all things in the closet!!! my one reservation is it only comes in one color. let's get on it designers! we need a lipstick red for summer and coral and navy and black and white. i don't need any other top! this one has great cool fabric and you don't need to wear",5
I'm wearing this shirt right now. i'm usually a large in tops. i bought a medium and i'm kinda wishing i got a small instead. it's very swingy. its super cute but size down at least one size maybe two,5
"This is a perfect top for warm weather. and depending on the accessories you pair it with, it can be great to wear while running errands or for a casual date. the woven texture at the back is unique and gives it the retailer vibe we all know and love. definitely runs big but that's part of the charm of the top.",5
"I picked this top hoping that it would go with the dipped horizon skirt and the color was a perfect match! i love the irregularities in the dye, and the woven back. the cut is boxy, but the fabric is soft and drapes well so very flattering. looks great with white jeans",5
"I generally wear a small or medium in tops, and decided to get the medium/large. it's over-sized, but it lays very nicely and doesn't look ""frumpy"". the back of the shirt is exactly as it looks in the picture. the front of the shirt is more of a solid blue than is shown, but still lovely.",5
"I just got this in xs/s at my store and i love it. i have a petite frame (5'3"", +/- 105 lbs) so it's much longer on me than on the models. and the one i got is much more saturated with dye on the front than what's shown in retailer's pics, so that may vary a bit. however, the back of mine looks exactly like what's shown above. i love the drape and the way it falls on me; super casual-chic in my opinion. i'd say the color is deep teal. wish it wasn't hand wash, but sometimes that's worth it.",5
"This is the ideal easy-breezy sweater to throw over leggings when you just feel like being comfy, cozy, but still stylish. i love it.",5
"Comfy, casual, and stylish! i received many compliments on this shirt. it drapes across your body very nicely and does not cling. it has a great asymmetrical cut that is very flattering. the material is comfortable and the color is warm and summer-like.",5
I love this top. it comes with its own camisole. the embroidery is lovely and the fit is perfect.,5
"Love love love this shirt!  great quality .. washes / dries wonderfully!  it is loose and flowy .. it's supposed to be that way - but it lays nicely!  it's longer than pictured which i love - i'm sure i'm shorter than the model but it's truly a perfect shirt! goes great with my jean skirt.. jeans, shorts and dressier skirts.  if you get a chance to order .. don't hesitate!  :)",5
"Grabbed this top because i loved the color and to my surprise i loved the style too! it is longer on me than the model (and i'm 5'10"") and it looks great with a long pendant necklace and white skinny jeans. i also wear a white tank underneath just in case, otherwise i think i'd be showing some skin. i like that the front and back are two different materials.",5
"This tank is perfect for summer since it pairs so nicely with shorts! jeans work well, too, and during cooler seasons, i can wear a cardigan over it to stay warm.

the fit of this top is not true to size, for it runs large, but is flattering on the body nonetheless. the stripes and miniature circular openings, i noticed, add beautiful detail for formal or informal events.

as a whole, this shirt is perfect! the one aspect of this top that may need to be carefully attended to is the material",5
"I bought the m/l (5'4"",130lb) and love the way it hangs and the length, and the fact that it can be worn over a lightweight top. the color and feel of the fabric are very nice.",5
"Love this. the stripes are cute and simple, but even better is the texture of the fabric (do a close up on the photo if you can). it's a swing tank, so there is a lot of fabric, but styled the right way and this is dreamy :) i passed on it only because i like my tops much longer than usual and this one wasn't quite long enough for me. i tried true to size and had it been longer i would have went with it - but smaller ladies might want to down size a size or two :)",5
"Oh how i love this bra!! its so comfortable and very flattering. i find that many bralettes totally flatten me out but this one does not. and the floral lace here is just beautiful. the daisy-type flowers look so cute and feminine! i've got it in so many colors now. for sizing, i'm 34b and the s/m fits great.",5
"I received this top over the weekend and i absolutely love it! it does not smell, nor does it itch, as the other reviewer stated... at least not for me. i was worried about the green color, but it's quite lovely. this is a keeper for me! i am 5'1"", but ordered the regular xs, and i am happy with the length.",5
"What a great shirt. however, none of the ones i saw in store are colored like the picture. the front of them are all a deep blue color, no tie-dyed effect or whatever you're seeing on the online pics. the shirt runs large. i am an 8/10 38c and the smaller size was plenty big. i can't imagine how the larger size would have looked! i think this top will go with many things, including as a cover up over dresses.",5
"I got this shirt in a medium, my normal retailer size and while the short fit, the front is cropped! i am a fan of the tops that are shorter in the front and longer in the back, however this was just too short in the front. my belly button was exposed, and that wasn't the look displayed on the model. unfortunately this top is going back to the store.",1
"I took a leap and ordered this top in both colors. my style is bohemian and flowy so i knew this fit the bill. i purposely bought these blouses because i read the reviews and being a 16/36h, i knew i needed then to run on the larger side. i love both colorways equally, but that said, the blue and yellow pattern runs a whole size smaller than the brown patterned blouse. the fit and fabric even feel different! the blue and yellow is thicker and less flowy and fits exactly to my body instead of bei",5
"I have loved ag stevie ankle denim for awhile now and have never been disappointed with the fit or quality. this pair is no exception to that. i am 5'5"" and about 113, slender with athletic thighs and the 26 fit great. buying them on-line, i wasn't able to check how distressed the denim was. the pair i received in the mail was indeed slightly different in the distressed locations from the on-line image. mine had no distressing on the upper thigh and one medium and one small spot on each leg. onl",5
I love this top. the color and the embroidery are beautiful and unique. i love the soft cotton arms and back. wish there were more colors.,5
Very attractive and well fitting. absolutely recommend it.,5
"I didn't expect the fit to be as cute, i am not sure i like how the model is wearing this top, but untucked, or more tucked both look more falttering on. the color is more vibrant in person, still light turquoise, but richer. i don't think i nbeed petite in this as it is blousy, but not oversized or boxy.",5
"I got this in an xs as the s sold out before i could purchase. i can still zip it at 27.5/28"" but would be more comfortable at say 26"". i'm almost 5'5"" and with 3"" heels it skims the floor perfectly. i'm so obsessed with the weight and texture! it is full and fabulous! i'll just need to slim down a tad so i can be comfortable at my sister-in-laws wedding next month. 
i wore a very fitted tank and it works perfectly! photographs well and feels very red carpet worthy.",5
This shirt has absolutely no shape. look carefully at the model and you we discover she is cleverly positioned to hide the sheer boxy-ness of this shirt. the print is beautiful but it looks like a maternity shirt. i even ordered the xs at 5'7 and 130 lbs but found it too baggy. returned.,1
"This is a great cardigan to wear buttoned or open. the fit is perfect; it is fitted and looks great with jeans, skirts or over a sleeveless dress. love the little detail of lace to show skin. fabric has lycra so it hugs your bodice just enough!! love it.",5
This is a cross between a sweater and a sweatshirt. not a heavy weight but very warm. the color is vibrant. many compliments.,5
Bought this top for date night -- something a little special. it's that and also very comfortable. i have broad shoulders and this style accommodates. easy to dress up or down -- perfect!,5
"I love this dress so much...what an excellent purchase! i wear this with white leggins and love the look. this dress has a sheath underneath the flower pattern that is form fitting, which i think is way sexy from the back. the front part of the dress is very flowy and moves nicely. i love the high neck on this piece and the beautiful colors. a wonderful pick up from retailer.",5
This is a great pair of trousers for work but can also be dressed down. they are very flattering and runs true to size. they're also a bit highwaisted which i love. my only complaint is that they are unlined. i'm not sure why a nice pair of wool trousers would be unlined. however i'm still giving them 5 stars because the fit and quality outweigh the one con.,5
I love this top! i originally bought the brown/purple pattern and wore it all the time so when i saw the blue and yellow on sale i had to get it. the fabric is really soft and breezy - perfect for the spring to summer weather. the sleeves are a little long on me but doesn't bother me. it runs a little large but works with my style. i would have sized down but it wouldn't have fit in the bust (i'm a 36d). i definitely recommend this top!,5
This shirt is more stunning in person. the color is a brighter turquoise than shown & the details are beautiful. fits true to size & is very flattering/slimming. love it!,5
The print is very pretty but the fabric is stiff and it runs way too big.  looks great on the model but awful on me.,1
This swimsuit is so beautiful and fits wonderfully and is very flattering. comfortable fit as well. love it!,5
"I have quite a few of these tiny henleys because they are unique and comfortable. the color and details of this one are beautiful. if you are a fan of these too, you won't be disappointed with this one.",5
"This too is easy to wear, skins the body nicely & the color is very pretty. some of the retailer tops have issues for me because i find the necklines too low. not this one. the placket lays flat & doesn't expose excessive cleavage. the details on the blouse are pretty & subtle. the top washed well in the delicate cute. just hang it to dry and it looks great!",5
"Bought this for my daughter in law's birthday. it's just a beautiful, feminine design, well made, nice fabric.. she can wear this for work or for lunch or an evening out. very versatile.",5
This is a pretty blouse but everything else you wear with it needs to be sharp because it can be dowdy otherwise.,5
Love this blouse and stunning color. the ruffles make it special and different!,5
"These are such a great fall staple. the silver color is the perfect grey-olive, and the texture is perfect. doesn't feel like there is extra material like most cords, and they hold their shape throughout the day. the fit is just perfect, i can finally order pants online that i know will fit just perfectly.",5
"These corodorys are considered mid waist but i interpret them as the perfect height for the low waist or regular rise. other than that, they are beautiful so comfortable not stretchey yet not constricting. i'm 5'6"" 107lb got a size 25 and i need a belt in the waist but the butt and legs are perfect and the waist isn't too big just not constricting. i always get urban outfitter corodorys but this year their quality is bad and these made of up it 100% plus the length is perfect",5
"I ordered the dusty pink color and love it. works well with many colors and tops. i am 5' 6"" and 121 lbs. with an athletic lean body. i do have a butt however and a small waist. i vary between a 26 and 27. ordered both because i could see this was a very slim pant. i could barely get the 26 up over my hips. the 27 fits like a glove, with just the right amount of stretch. i can't see these pants bagging after wear, which is something we all hate. love these pants and i know i will wear them often",5
"This is probably the softest, most flattering hoodie that i have ever worn. i can dress it up or down and it has drapes really beautifully. great for spring & summer, love it as a coverall at the beach. my partner rarely compliments my clothes and actually told me how much he liked the way it looked on me. highly recommend.",5
"These are flattering and the colors are really nice. they're a bit tighter than other pilcro pants i've tried, but the material is stretchy.",5
"I love this dress! high quality dress in a classic style. the cotton eyelet detailing is my favorite part and really elevates this from just another black dress. it is a swing silhouette (as described in the product description) so there is a little more volume than a regular dress, but that's what makes it fun and breezy! great dress, can't wait to wear it when it gets a little warmer.",5
"Love these.  i bought the grey which is a grey/taupe/light olive chameleon.  totally depends upon what i wear with them.  the rolled up cuff is adorable and the material is perfect.  the fit is true to size - tight but not restrictive.  comfy all day long.   and best of all, they don't stretch out over the day.   i'm 5'10, a size 6 normally and a size 28 fit me perfectly.",5
"I saw this dress in the store and loved everything about it. they had an extra large, i usually wear a large, and i thought it would perfect with some leggings. i tried to get the dress over my chest but no chance. my sister who wears a medium tried to put it in too and she couldn't fit it past her chest either. we flipped it inside out and couldn't find a zipper. maybe the dress in the store was mislabeled but the bust ran very small. it's too bad, it looked adorable and i was so excited to try",1
"I just received the pink in the mail. i am 5' 5"" and around 140. i ordered the size 29, they fit perfectly. they are a very straight leg with a snug fit. you can adjust the cuff to whatever length you need or unroll them completely. the fabric is of beautiful quality. i basically never wear corduroy because it can add pounds. not so with this pair of pants. i am thinking about another color!!",5
"Just picked this up at the store 40% off sale price, well worth it! the petite hits perfect on my 5'3"" frame, right about where it hits the model in the pic. very well made good quality piece i can see myself wearing quite often.",5
"I bought these cords in navy. the color is beautiful and the fit is great. it is a very slimming fit. i am usually between a 27 and 28, i ordered the 28 and they fit perfectly!",5
This dress is a zillion times cuter in real life. it's very retro-swingy and girlish- it reminds me of something mia farrow would've worn in her rosemary's baby era. i have the black version and i've paired mine with tall black gladiator sandals for a more sultry nighttime look and also flip flops for beachy summer days. i think it's a total steal at the sale price.,5
"I really love this rose-pink color. the pants fit like a glove. the cuff is not sewn up, so you can lower the cuff to where you like it.",5
These pants are a really pretty color and feel nice on. the fit was great and did not really shrink with washing. i received a lot of compliments the first time i wore them.,5
I love this tank. i didn't find it to be see through at all. it runs true to size. it's super comfy and the lace up detail makes it more fun than a plain old tank top. it's a great basic and i love the lilac color.,5
Out of stock so quickly in my size. please restock!,5
"Just got the silver ones in the mail yesterday -- really great fall pants! they are quite a bit more grey than how they look on my computer, so i was a bit surprised, but not unpleasantly.
 i'm one of those people who always has trouble with pants because my thighs are bigger and my waist smaller than usual. i'm 5'6"", 120 with a 26 inch waist and 38 inch hips. i ordered the 28 so my legs could fit inside the pants, but there is quite a bit of gaping at the waist meaning that i cannot go without",5
"I bought two pair in one week...crazy right? i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i bought the pink color, soft faded pink, which drew me to them right away...kinda soft and romantic pink. then two days later went back (one hour drive) and bought the silver which is really a worn in green color. i feel these are true to size, i wouldn't size down because these are""t super stretchy....feels like it also won't bag out during the day. i really love these cords....and the rolled up cuff is adorable.",5
"These flares are so soft and comfy they just may become my favorite go to jeans.
i loved the higher rise because they don't feel like they're will fall off like many low cut jeans do.
the material might be the softest jean fabric i have ever owned.
love the braided styling around the pockets.
the bell bottom may be a bit too wide for my liking but the other aspects make that one thing ok.",5
Even on sale sale...this tank is not worth the money. the design in the back is adorable & would expect it to be so much better quality but the fabric is flimsy(think old man white tanks that come in a pack) completely see through and lack of shape..i wanted to love this but definitely photographed significantly better than actuality!,1
Thank goodness they had a special discount because i love this sweater. it is not normal for me to splurge but there was something about this sweater and it didn't disappoint. too cute. a great top to wear to a concert or a relaxed party. i love it.,5
"I love this dress. it is loose fitting so be prepared for that. i ordered an xs. i believe the dress was intended to fit this way though and i do not think it looks too big on me. i typically wear a 0 or 00 in dresses. this would be a great dress to wear if you were planning on eating a big meal, ha. i can't wait to wear this dress in the summer and believe i will wear it often. it has more of a boho look to it. i do think it could be worn with heels though. i will probably wear it with flat gol",5
"I got the green one. as the other reviewers commented, yes, the fabric is thin. however, i wear it with a nude bra and a nude cami and i've had nothing but compliments!",5
I loved this shirt online but when it came to my house i loved it even more. super comfy and really flattering! i love it!!! runs true to size!,5
"I love this dress, and on sale it's a total steal. it's true to size, and beyond comfortable! i live in az so i can easily wear this year round. i got the black color and love it. i'm 5'4"" and it hits a little above my knees. love the loose, feminine swing. i feel like skipping wearing this dress :)",5
"I ordered an xxs and it fit perfectly. i love the simple, yet girly look of this top. the bottom material is delicate and adds a feminine touch. it looks even better in person than in the pictures. the material is very soft and comfortable. looks great with jeans and flats or boots!",5
I loved this top. i paired it with he ag stevie short and jasper and jeera beaded sandals. look was super cute and casual. i love the fact you can adjust the fit in the back with the lace up detailing. flowly tank without the maternity look. i went with the lavender color and it looks great with my olive skin. i had no problem with sheerness when wearing a nude bra. for reference i am 5'6'' 132 lbs and went with the small.,5
"I've been on the hunt for flattering cords for a long time, and these fit the bill! bought the silver on friday and am going to order the pink. the silver is really more taupe, as pictured, so if you're looking for true grey, this is not the pair for you. but the fit is fantastic. i'm 5'3"" athletic build about 130 lbs and the 27 fits perfectly. finally cords that don't make my muscular thighs look giant!",5
I tried on this top in store & was a bit wishy washy on it at first. however i am so glad i bought it and have worn it 3x in a week (shh!). it is incredibly lightweight & breathable which is great for hot texas summers. i also love that it has interesting back detail. the other reviewers mentioned it was see through but i don't agree - i wear a nude bra with it and have no issues. it can be worn casually with shorts or dressed up with white denim & fancier accessories. either way it looks best w,5
"These cords are so soft and snug on- like a hug for your lower half! i appreciate their lack of stretch: they don't seem to ""bag out"" like other cords can. i like that the fabric is soft but the shape is more stiff. the grey is slightly lighter/more silvery in real life than the picture depicts. for ref, i'm 5'2"" and 103lbs and i bought the 24p.",5
"Very comfortable, but ran small. great quality and great look.",5
Top feels like pajamas but looks very classy. the sweater material is so soft. i wear it with a blazer over the top and i get so many compliments on it. wish they had it in more colors! must have!,5
These are awesome! i have the pink which is a very light faded sort of color. they are beautiful and very nice quality. they are slimmer and stretchier then i imagined but very flattering.,5
I just received these jeans. love them. i usually wear a 29- i ordered a 30 and they fit great. they are too long- will need to be hemmed. but the fit is great. the material is soft. lovely. great buy.,5
This top is comfortable and yet with some stylish detail. the fabric is soft and the lilac color looks great. it hangs loose but with a nice drape. at the sale price it is not to be missed.,5
"Yes, it is big. but it is also amazing. so soft, the colors are great, and the hood, well, the hood makes it. great colors for fall. it's a poncho. it's not supposed to be fitted. i'll be wearing this all fall through winter. love it.",5
"Holy cow! i just got a new bathing suit so i cannot splurge again, but this is flattering!!!! i like the more tame colors which doesn't scream ""look at me"" (let's be honest, there are certain times of the month where we'd rather crawl in a ball and hide). the design along the sides is absolutely flattering and slimming on anyone. i also like the skin-tone/coral detailing around the top of the breast that extends all the way around the back. retailer is really winning with their swimwear thi",5
"I like how styling and comfortable it is, i bought it in both colors. definitely a nice piece for fall/winter in this houston weather.",5
"Wore this poncho and received 5 compliments before the school day even began! love the pockets and hood. bought three at the sale price - one for me, a friend, and my niece - different ages and sizes but everyone of us love this poncho.",5
This dress is beautiful. fabric is thin but the details are perfect.,5
The photos do not do this gorgeous dress justice. the iridescent material makes it perfect for a fancy date night and i received complements from complete strangers. would also be great as a wedding guest or bridesmaid dress!,5
"I have loved this dress from the first time i saw it. but the price scared me away until a sale came to be that meant i could justify buying it. honestly it's worth it's original price, i'm just too much of a scrooge to pay it! the details are adorable. the length makes it very versatile. it seems well made and pretty weighty. fits nicely due to the elastic in the back; i got an 8.. i weigh 170, 5'8"" with a small chest. most of the dresses i buy are just as much art as they are fashion and this",5
"I thought this dress was beautiful, but i felt it was a little young for me. i am 55 and was looking for something to wear to my niece's wedding. if i had been the mother of the bride, i would have kept it, but....",5
The appliquã© on this dress is well done. i would recommend it to anyone. the design is super flattering and feminine.,5
This is great just to have and throw on.it is a everyday piece.,5
I love this poncho because it's the perfect weight and it is softer than i thought it would be. i will get a lot of use out of it. getting it on sale made it even better.,5
"I ordered the lavender version in xl. it fit me as shown on the model so i think it runs true to size. it is a little shorter than shown. it hits my waist & i'm 5 ft. 5 1/2 in. for reference. it fits close through the arms & body but with a comfortable, stretchy material. a tank underneath is needed. i love the draping. it's very flattering. the color is more of a gray than purple. i took the chance on it when it was on sale and it's now a favorite. great neckline for wearing necklaces too.",5
"This is going to be my go-to winter sweater for work! this piece is super comfy, yet a bit more dressy than just a regular sweatshirt. it will be an especially great layer for the ups and downs of the office thermostat.",5
I loved the idea behind this shirt but it just hangs around the waist with tons of extra fabric. i suspect the model in the photo has the shirt pinned. totally unflattering making the chest look small and your midsection appear huge. maybe if you size down it would be better- xs was not available for me to try. also the lavender color is really washed out...,1
"This pants are very comfortable, and add a little flare to my typical ""mom pajama"" look. i found them true to size; size small fit my 5'7, 135lbs frame. comfortable to sleep and lounge in!",5
"The design is loose and forgiving, and it is very comfortable. the fabric is soft and light weight, and i love how the sleeves are full cut so even those without stick arms can fit in them! it drapes beautifully and is quite lovely on. you can easily dress it up with jewelry or wear it over jeans for a great go-to top on the weekend. i also bought the purple version - it says it's mauve in the description, but it's really more of a pale lavender color. still very pretty, but i wish it was mauve!",5
Bought this top in black and i love it! fits true to size with arms a little snug but because of the stretch in the fabric it is fine. the top is very flattering and looked like the model. the front is shorter but very flattering! love it.,5
I absolutely am obsessed with this poncho! it is the perfect piece for fall and so easy to layer.,5
"I love this shirt so much i came back and bought it in black (i originally got the lavender color). it is super easy to wear and has a delicate quality to it (though i washed it on a regular cycle and it's holding up well!). as you can see from the photos, because of the wrap style, the middle of the front is shorter than the rest of the shirt. i've worn this top with regular rise jeans and haven't had a problem, though if you lift your arms, your belly may show. i purchased my usual size small",5
"It's is an absolutely gorgeous dress, one of a kind . you must have it in your wardrobe . my seamstress needed to adjust it just a tiny bit but it's truly fits to size and is emphasizing the figure.",5
"I loved this skirt when i tried it on. the material is soft with a bit of stretch. i'd say this runs a little large. for reference, i'm usually a size 2/4 in retailer and the 2 was still a little large towards the end of the day as it stretched out. 

however, my disappointment was with the buttons.i wore it for a day when all of a sudden the top button popped off. fine, that button is the most used. i sewed it back on myself and even reinforced the top three buttons that i use to take on and of",1
This dress is awesome - i actually first saw it on lucy lui on elementary and thought it had to be from retailer. sure enough it was and it was on sale. i got the blue and would have gotten both if they had my size. i am usually a m and found this fit true to size. i always love a wrap dress and this with the buttons keeps it from spilling open - love it!,5
I love this poncho. i would wear it to the beach or even for fun outing like wine tasting!,5
"Classic retailer stunning dress! the embroidery is beautiful, with the beads and details. the blush color can be difficult with my pale complexion, but i didn't have trouble with this. i got a ton of compliments. it looks a bit flat on top on the model. i'm not very curvy, and it accentuates my curves nicely. it doesn't hang down quite so much as it looks in the picture, but has a more classic fit and flare shape, very flattering.",5
"I love this poncho!! it's perfect for chilling saturday mornings at the soccer field. it's a nice warm layer, but doesn't get to hot. pair it with a long sleeve shirt, jeans and some boots and you're set.",5
I have been looking for a skirt like this and love this one. it does sit a little high on your waist but i like that and think it's more flattering (at least on me it is). i marked that it runs try to size but may run a tiny bit on the larger size. i usually wear a 4 but a 2 fit great and it's been a long time since i've worn a 2!,5
Adorable skirt. thought the a-line and length were great. 5'4 and 135lbs. went up a size and it fit perfect. can dress it up or down. really happy with this wardrobe staple.  not too stiff denim of so moves well and feels comfortable.,5
Love it to layer. it is not heavy the perfect weight & soft material. my daughters all want to steal it!,5
"I got the purple and its a lovely muted purple, almost lavender. nice quality, flattering. i recently had a baby so this is a nice shirt to hide my wobbly bits. i'd recommend to anyone (with or without wobbly bits).",5
I wish they would have shown this belted as it is beyond striking if you slip you belt thru the top of the slit.under the fabric and bring thru the front belting only the front leaving the back full...stunning and chic! because of the colors this will be incredible in the fall...i plan to wear with all my on trend overalls and booties...madly in love with it. i am certain if all these 1 star reviwes played with it in the fashion they too would have given 5 stars. the knit is beautiful and again,5
"Great fabric and design, beautiful pattern with flattering angled bottom hem and fringe. so soft and comfortable.  the hood is cuter left down. perfect transitional piece for fall.  i got the neutral color and it is so easy to wear.  i'm 5'3"" and got the s/xs size and feel that it is still wearable.  i second the opinion one reviewer mentioned about wearing a belt through the slit over the front part. definitely works well and makes for an effortlessly stylish look.",5
I love all my retailer clothes! it's my favorite store! i even love the displays!,5
Love this skirt length and the detail buttons. also great give to the jean fabric. looks great on and runs true to size.,5
"I was a little bit afraid to purchase this because of the price, but i am so glad i did because this is a gorgeous swimsuit. the quality is amazing, and the colors are exactly as pictured. i have a small-ish frame with a big bust, and this style keeps my figure very flattering without making my chest look too big or heavy.",5
"I normally wear a 4, and that technically fit if i didn't plan to sit. i went a size up and it was still gorgeous but now i could breathe.  it is incredibly sexy yet sophisticated, my husband is always asking why i need another dress and when he saw me in he fitting room his eyes lit up and he said you definitely need to get this dress. needless to say i'll wear it on our next date..",5
"I was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person. the fabric is a rough gauzy texture. the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something, they do not hang or move well on the body. also, they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off. sadly, these are going back.",1
"I am five foot tall, about 103lb and got the petite zero - it fits perfectly and i love the flower pattern! great for weddings, parties or work.",5
"Great little summer jacket that takes the place of a jean jacket . i am not usually fond of olive green but this is a bit deeper than a drab olive without being too green. it is sooo soft and comfortable that i find i am pairing it with all sorts of outfits. fits tts if you are going for the look on the model- not too fitted.
i highly recommend this timeless piece.",5
"I am 5'3' and 120 lbs for reference, and pear shaped and this dress in a 4 petite fit like a glove. granted, not a dress i would want to gain weight in, but fit perfectly. usually i am a 2 in retailer dresses but read other reviews and definitely made the right choice. it hits at a very flattering length even for someone as short as i am.",5
I love this shirt! it is so different from most things i get but such a fun change. the colors are bright and fun! you totally do not have to be western to enjoy this shirt and it's fun for a good country dancing/party/concert too. my roommate has already asked to borrow it (as in she's wearing it at a concert as i type this!). it is incredibly comfortable! i got the xs and was kind of surprised it still felt a little big. but i kept the size to wear it half tucked or even kind of oversized. i w,5
"I bought this top to have so that i can pair it with a lot of my other wardrobe pieces. the top is amazing! it is soft, great fabric, a cute cut, and can be styled in so many ways! definitely worth the buy!",5
"I ordered this dress, and loved, loved it. beautiful, great fabric. the length was even perfect for me and i'm 5'4"". i am usually a size 8, but ordered up to a 10 because i am a little woman with the exception of my chest. i have ordered dresses before from retailer where i had to order certain dresses a size larger and they worked. unfortunately this time, it wasn't to be. tried the dress on and it fit nicely until the side zipper got to my chest area. i would have ordered another size lar",5
"This dress is made well; the construction/sewing details give the dress a beautiful shape. it has a nice zipper at the back, and fabric feels light. pockets are a good size. skirt flows, but doesn't feel heavy. fit is comfortable. i typically wear somewhere between a size 4/6. i ordered a 4 and it fits just right. i'm 5""6 and it falls below my knee--length is nice. armholes are a bit lower than i thought, but not too low. it's a classic/modern look. it was sold out when i first wanted to buy it,",5
"I have a booty, and these pants love it. they fit my curves (size 10 with flat abs, but as i said a booty) all while looking professional. at m y husband's insistence i'm buying they grey too.",5
"Maeve really keeps me guessing on sizing...usually too big, but this one is too small in my normal 4, so i went with the 6 for comfortable movement while still maintaining the intentional fitted look. fabric is of beautiful quality, colors are true to the picture - just a gorgeous timeless dress that i imagine wearing to many special events, or with a denim jacket over it for work :)",5
"This jacket is so great! i've gone through a few seasons now trying to find that one perfect little olive green jacket. this one wins! the color is nice and saturated. the fabric is soft and drapey so it's still flattering to my shape. it's slightly relaxed and i think it creates an ""easy"" look. i've already worn this with a dress, and it will finish off many other looks in my closet! yea! i'm 5'6"", 138 lbs and took a medium.",5
"Gorgeous top, and generous to fuller figures. i meant to order an xl but somehow ended up with the l. was positive i'd have to return it, but it was perfect. went back and bought the white. it's one of those wonderful pieces that feels classy and fun at the same time. very flattering fit.",5
"Love the print so much!! it is a bit boxy, but for the length i needed to size up to a s from my usual xs with my long torso at 5'7"", 111lbs. i'm thinking that sizing up will also save me from any potential dryer accidents. but it doesn't really matter what size you get-just get it for the cute print scene!!",5
"I ordered this top in size xl. there is a lot of excess material below the empire waist so it flows out too much. this accentuated my pear-shape and was unflattering. the sizing on the top portion & sleeves was true-to-size. 

the material is so rough, scratchy & uncomfortable. they should have used a softer fabric. the pattern alignment is terrible on the one i received. at $100, i hoped the plaid would have flowed in a continuous, matching line. i didn't notice the mismatched sleeves of the",1
"I have a hard time finding slacks that are a step up from jeans and that is why these are such a great find. they feel great, fit well, the price was good even before i got them on sale, i love the color and they seem like they will be easy to take care of. wish they came in more colors..",5
"I absolutely love this dress! i purchased it in my usual size 2 petite and it looks as though it was made for me. the combination of the placement of the pattern and the cut of the dress was quite figure flattering. the only tiny issues i had were that the dress fell to the middle of my kneecaps and may need a hem; in addition, the dress takes a bit of maneuvering to get into due to the side zipper and the close fit. despite these issues, i feel that it is definitely worth buying and i will be k",5
"I really like this shirt. i fell for it after seeing it paired with grey jeans, but when i searched the entire website i couldn't find it. then a couple of days later it appeared. i was super excited and i'm glad i ordered it. i was not disappointed. the shirt is soft and long enough to cover my waist area without riding up if i bent at the waist. the colors are very vibrant and its quite stylish. i ordered a medium and it fit perfectly.",5
"This dress is really beautiful. i was looking for something to wear to a summer 6 o'clock wedding, and this dress will work perfectly. the fabric is smooth and has a tiny bit of sheen to it which makes it look a little nicer and more formal. however, you can easily dress it down. my only issue was the length. i'm 5'4 and this dress was way too long. definitely need to take off about 5 or 6 inches! i also had to size up. i could have tried the petite, but it fit so well everywhere except length,",5
"I've been moving toward a simple tee and jean wardrobe, and this is the perfect addition! it's so fun and different and so comfortable. i've been loving retailer's new tee's! it runs a little large but in a cute way.",5
"I found that this dress ran very small. i am true 8, ordered a 10 and it was snug",1
"I'm 6 ft tall and usually wear a size 10/12, but had to size up to a 14 because this dress runs a bit small around the waist. it's a beautiful dress. it hit me right below the knee, so might be long on shorter gals. i received many compliments on this dress. the colors are beautiful. the main color of the dress is a dark navy. it looked black online. definitely buy this dress! it's a great work dress and you won't be sorry that you did.",5
"Love this dress! can be dressed down or up for dresser occasions. i did order a petite which i usually don't do but due to the length being so long but the petite is just right hitting a couple inches below the knee. i'm 5'4""",5
Love this shirt and the print. i would wear it all the time if socially acceptable. i've only worn it once but have already gotten so many compliments. there are hints of neon in the coloring that can't really be seen in the pictures. i saw it in store and fell in love and then decided to splurge when i saw it online and couldn't think of life without it.,5
"This came in the mail today. i wasn't sure of my size, so i ordered a s & m. i tried on the small first and it fit perfect. i never tried on the medium. fyi, i'm 5'5"", 125 lbs., & 34a in the chest. this jacket is a keeper.
it is so soft & comfortable on; i love olive as it goes with everything; it can be super casual or dressier depending upon what you're wearing. i also like that it is collarless as that better allows for a wrapped scarf. i will use this jacket a lot.",5
"I bought both of these tees and they are perfect under my new fringe denim cloth & stone shirt and dress ....had to have both! the gray tee is so cute has every color of all my pilcro chinos...what a bonus. looks too cute paired with the denim shirts and is a great fall transition. i dressed up the cowboy tee with a chunky green stone necklace. i bought the small and for reference am 5'3"" and 32h bra size and have no pulling so they are tts and only slightly shaped which works perfect for us bus",5
"I just received these sweaters............couldn't decide which color i liked best....blue and green are my favs.
and so i ordered them both!
they are a wow !
i am totally in love with both of them.
they are sooooooooooooooo beautiful!
beyond my wildest expectations!
i wear a size 8 and ordered the size 2 and it fits perfectly......a 2 is a size medium per call to retailer before i ordered.....and 1 is small, ad 0 is extra small.
this is a bulky, cuddly winter sweater with a touch of glam w",5
The print is even better in person! true to size. flattering fit.,5
"This is the dress that i have been waiting for all season. perfect color. the material is also ""firm"" without being heavy or thick (if you know what i mean). it lays flat and smooths out any bumps without being overly stiff. the v-neck is also not too deep and the sleeves are not too short. overall, a complete win. now go and make it in gray and navy blue please.",5
I love western motif so i had to try this t shirt. quality is great..material is high quality. also the length is long..perfect with jeans and jacket or sweater!,5
"I absolutely love this dress! very well made, fits like a glove, and very flattering! the fabric is stretchy which makes the fit perfect and comfortable. i will be wearing this to a graduation and i'm sure i'll find many other occasions to wear this dress.",5
"I just couldn't resist the western scene and it doesn't disappoint. i ordered size large and although it's a bit long for me, it flows nicely over my hips. i had to try it on with several different bottoms and find it looks great with shorts and skinny or boyfriend jeans. just darling under a jean jacket and cardigan too. the fabric isn't thin or heavy. wasn't it goldilicks who said: it's just right! i love the uniqueness of the print that is just edgy and different enough to translate to great,",5
"This little jacket is so soft and perfectly lightweight. the color goes with everything! more money than i wanted to spend, but i am so glad i took a chance and ordered online. it is exactly what i was looking for!",5
"I love pairing this skirt with edgy tops, it plays so well with the detailing! i'm usually a size 8 but sized up to a 10 so that it didn't pull, other than that,  absolutely love it! beautiful all over",5
"I have had good luck with cloth and stone and this did not disappoint. i knew i would like it because i have this same top in a long sleeve and sleeveless. it is cute, not too sheer and easy to iron.",5
"I love this top! the fabric is so soft and it's perfect with white pants. yes it does run wide and is short, but if you get the correct size it looks just like it does on the model!",5
"This blouse is stunning. i have been wanting it for some time. i finally broke down and purchased it. i am 5' 8"" and about 160lbs. i generally wear size l /size 10. i bought this in a large. i need a medium for sure. i could get away with the large, but it's very flowy. i think the med will be more flattering. i am planning to exchange for a smaller size. i would recommend this blouse for sure. if you want it, buy it. it's often times sold out.",5
Love this shirt. great shape and lightweight material for hot houston weather. washes up nice but does need some ironing.,5
"The lines on the dress are lovely. the material is a nice thick jersey, which can be body-hugging, but mostly on top. it falls beautifully and looks good with heels and flats and boots. i am xs or s depending on the dress, and i got the xs in this one.",5
"Just purchased this for a midsummer formal wedding. i am 5'6'' 125 lbs, ended up going with the size 2 for extra room, the 0 felt very snug thru the chest.",5
"What a great little find. it is so soft, and the color blends with everything. a great way to get a few more weeks out of your summer sleeveless dresses, and ease into fall. great with t shirts and pants as well.the collar is flattering over any neckline. it also looks great as a shirt. it really can be worn all year round. i usually wear a size six on top, as ""my girls"" are large. the medium was a perfect fit. and there was no billowing in the back. worth the price, as it will become a go to ja",5
"Not sure i'm keeping this. i love it but it's short in the waist (i'm 5'7"") and very tight in the top. i'm on the small side of a size 8 normally. a 6 sometimes, but the 8 in this is very tight. i do have broad shoulders but am thin at 126 pounds. so not sure if it's just me or if the dress is truly smallish. it is lovely and i want to keep it. will try it on again tomorrow and decide. if you are on the large end of any size, do size up.",5
"This dress is of great quality and design. the lines and the way the dress shapes your body are perfect throughout the entire dress. i am short and it is a little long on me; it is between my calf and my ankle, but the way it flatters in the bust and waist more than makes up for it. with the right shoes, it is a real winner! i think this dress would be flattering on every body type. highly recommend!",5
"I find that every year (or two at the most) i have to find a new favorite black dress or two (fading, etc.), and, this is definitely one of those dresses for this year (almost one to buy another, so i have one that looks good in a year or two)! the dress is all around flattering and comfortable... looks wonderful with high heels and flats, looks good at work and while out having fun! probably won't be able to count how many times i wear it this year!",5
"I love this shirt! the colors are more muted in the photos, so i was a little surprised to see how bright some of the colors were. still super cute! also has a looser fit--i'm a small across brands (5'7"", 130, straight/slender build), so if you prefer a more true or tighter fit, size down. either way, get this!!!!",5
"This jacket fits great! i got a medium, and am 5'6"" , 140 lbs. very nice light weight jacket.",5
"So i fell in love with the print without even noticing that it had horses on it until after it arrived! i was sooo excited! but really the length and fit are the best part about this shirt. with my long torso things are generally too short on me. i'm a sucker for spending money on clothes but still i wish retailer could make cute tees for under 40 bucks:/ i say that, yet i'm not sending it back:)",5
"I just got this top today. the print is just as beautiful in person as it is on the web. it is so incredibly soft and comfortable. i tried it on and it fits just like the photo. i am 5'8 so i can get away with the blousy effect, but, i think that is part of why it is so charming. i think you could dress it up or down really well. i am really pleased.",5
"This dress is so flattering, not the usual type of dress i go for, but decided on a whim to try and am glad so glad i did. the material has enough heft to give you a beautiful silhouette without being too clingy. you can dress up or down, if you don;t like showing too much cleavage you may want to put a tank underneath to give you a little coverage.",5
"This is a great lightweight jacket. i really like the olive color as it goes with so many things. it can be worn with dresses or skirts which is what i mainly wear. i'm an anti-pant person. the only downside is the price. it's a nice stylish jacket, but not sure it warrants the high price tag. it also doesn't look to great buttoned up; has to be worn open. i do recommend it though.",5
"Bought this in store yesterday, light fit and extremely comfortable! i'm 5'4 135 and have a long torso, so i ended up going with a large in this one because i like my shirts to hang loose. print is more vivid in person but nonetheless a great but!",5
Ok you had me at the western scene. soft and comfortable. true to size. you can dress it up or down. just a great t shirt. recommend it! get it!!,5
"Love this top. the material is light, soft and comfortable. one thing to note. it runs very large? this feature is perfect for me as i was worried it would be too tight around the middle?this style would not look good if it didn't fit loose?..so i was pleasantly surprised to see that it fit me with plenty of room?.something i need for my full figure. if you are trim around the middle i recommend going down a size or two.",5
"Light weight jacket, perfect layering piece . short enough to be the right accessory over a dress or skirt without getting a sloppy look. versatile, - also great over a long tee with skinny jeans. well made, fold cuffs back for the classic look.",5
"I saw this and the ""giddy up"" tees at the store, and it was so difficult to decide because they have their own uniqueness. unlike the giddy up tee, this tee has no embroidery, but saying it has just patterns is underestimating it. the pattern is a work of art, it has cowboys, ranch scenery, cacti, and the earthly colors are gorgeous for all seasons (especially for those who still have a leftover summer tan). the hem of the tee is a bit round which i thought is unique and versatile for tucking in",5
"This is just as cute in person. i wear it with black jean shorts, boyfriend jeans, washed out jeans like the model, or khakis. the colors are great and so is the fit. love it.",5
"Loved it as soon as i opened the box--it's a light-to-medium weight sweatshirt with the wonderfully vibrant flower front. i wasn't sure about the flowers online, but like 'em! the cuffs and hem are nicely made and the v-neck back is an unexpected addition. this will be great with a scarf or alone this fall. can't wait for the weather to cool down!",5
This jacket is adorable.. it is very flattering and different. can easily be dressed up for work or dressed down as shown. note: it is unlined and very light weight. these are huge selling points for me as it makes the jacket seasonless. love it!!!,5
"I have featured a picture below. i'm 5 feet 120 lbs. i ordered an xs petite. i'm pretty busty so i don't like a loose fitting top, so ordering a size down did the trick. it's super soft, one of a kind and the edging of the neckline is delicate looking and soft and therefore adds a feminine element. i'm enjoying wearing the top.",5
Cozy. soft. comfortable. a perfect transitional top that bubbles over with personality..it's a unique fabric design that makes you feel like you're on vacation ..love it.,5
Perfect! awesome! i have a few of these now and love them. they do stretch a little so i wouldn't size up. i'm about 138 pounds and 5'8'' and normally m. i wear the 27 in these.,5
This pullover is a great purchase. the color is simply stunning and is very comfortable.,5
"I bought this jacket in green and it is beautiful. the green is a true
forest green. sizing is accurate. my only wish is that they offered more colors and the snaps were double faced so you could snap the collar back.",5
"I love lace dresses and this one is no exception. great construction and color. i paired the dress with a plum colored blazer and i really was pleased at how well it all went together. i'm about 5'8"" and 170 i'm normally an 8 or 10 at retailer, my 8 fits great and is not tight at all, so i'm thinking it may run a tad bit big.",5
I love this sweater. the green is soft. the fabric is light enough for year round in my area. i thought it might be too young but it works nicely for me. i bought it in two other colors when the package arrived today.,5
"I love this top. it was everything i hoped it would be. it is lined so it is not see through in the chest/back; sleeves are sheer. soft. gorgeous color. love the layers. runs large so definitely size down. i am usually a m and ordered the s. i'm 5'8"" curvy 32dd",5
I thought the sweater was pricey until i saw it on me. this sweater is really flattering! i chose the grey colored one. i'm smaller on top and this sweater is perfect with the v neck cut out the fabric is also really soft.,5
"This sweater is very lightweight with the loose knit, but is much warmer than i was expecting. the periwinkle color is gorgeous. the chiffon hem provides a cute detail and it is true to size for a loose fit",5
Yay for the return of shirts that show your form but don't reveal the flaws! i bought this in cream which only seems to be in stores right now. the stripes on the cream version are vibrant and beautiful. the weight of the top is very nice and really hugs your shape. i did think it ran a tad small. i bought the large but also could have worn the medium.,5
"It's hard to find a sweater that is warm and cozy, but doesn't look bulky. this sweater does it all. it is delicate looking and soft and flattering. it is also surprisingly warm. i wear it with jeans for everyday, but it looks good enough to wear out to dinner or such. i bought the periwinkle which was the most flattering on me (blond and fair). i am hoping to get the green too when they go on sale. i said it runs a little small because i took a small instead of my usual extra small in sweaters.",5
"I loved this jacket! it's exactly what i was looking for. i set out to find a lightweight sweater or jacket that would keep me warm and also versatile enough to wear with different outfits. this definitely fit the bill! in addition, it's really soft and not at all itchy, which was a concern i had since it was wool and i ordered it online. i have received a bunch of compliments! i definitely recommend it!",5
"This top comes in 4 lovely colors, too bad only one of htem looks decent on my skin tone (purple), though i might have gotten away with the silvery grey.
fit: nice falttering line, flares at the bottom and is loose aroun d the waist, so if you ahve a problem area, nice coverage.
feel: super soft - nuff said ;-)
versatility: i am not sure it will look great with everything on my body type, but definitly a nice pair of jeans (flare or skinny with boots),a and may try the pencil skirt look like the",5
Love the fit. nice and warm and good quality material.,5
This green sweater is solo pretty . i wanted it from the moment i saw it. pretty layers on the bottom make it so unique!,5
"Dare i say, this is my favorite pair of pilcro legging cords yet. the pattern is beautiful, with green, black, and grey. the fit is as usual stellar and comfortable. the best yet!",5
"This sweater is very pretty. the pictures online do not show the intricate knitting and the lovely details or how delicate the yarn is. i bought the light orange color and i think it will transition nicely into spring. the shape is very figure flattering as well. overall, i am very happy with my purchase.",5
"I was on the lookout for a denim jacket when i found this beauty on line. i fell in love immediately and didn't think twice about paying full price. i wear it with moss green chinos and it looks really good. the little dots in the jacket are actually a pale green, which gives it extra character. very well made. i was a bit skeptical about the hook and eye fastenings, but they are very secure. 

i ordered my usual xl and found it roomy enough in the bust and arms. i would definitely call it tru",5
I was on a mission at retailer to find a versatile and comfortable jacket/cardigan. this is perfection. the detail and pattern in the wool make it unique and the zipper and snaps are great quality. i bought it in the green and is great for the office and out in jeans as well.,5
I love this pretty sweater. i am petite and thin and ordered the regular xs. the length was perfect- just below the hips. the sleeves are a bit long but you can pull them up a bit. this is a perfect winter dressy sweater to wear with black jeans or leather pants. the knit is very delicate and light but warm and the layered chiffon bottom makes it special.,5
"This is a great fitting jacket. the style, etc.
i got this in the grey - i would have exchanged it for the green (but have a similar color that i bought last year from retailer.
so i ended up returning it - only because i didn't like the color on me.",5
I adore these pants! comfortable as jammies and i wear with both sandals and booties. every time i wear them i am complimented on them!,5
So sure from the online shop & images that i ordered two pairs. the package arrived in less than 2 days and immediately i could see how the cords were everything i expected them to be. so incredibly soft and body forming and has a classic cord texture only softer. i love them ! this look works both daytime as well as evening - it's geared to work with any casual to couture look. my 22 year old niece wanted to buy the second pair (sz 28) from me so i gave them to her. she's a nice niece : ),5
"I am really into this jacket! the fit is nice although it does very slightly large; however, not enough to go down a size for me. all of the different textures are really cool and the details do seem to be pretty slimming, which is always a bonus. i am a bit worried that the wool will pill like crazy though. let's hope i'm wrong and that it lasts!",5
"Omg! so comfortable and feels like wearing nothing at all! i wish the blue print was still available in my size. tried them on at the store and fell in love! they say the length is 31.5, however i am on the tall side, usually wear 34"" in jeans, but these are perfect. i see from other reviews that these pants have been around for a while. please don't change them, and i will be getting another pair or two next year!!!",5
"I tried on a dressing room full of items before christmas, and this was the clear winner. i got it in the green xs, which fit perfectly. i am 5'6"" and of medium build. the s was slightly too big through the chest and arms - skewed a little too military looking for me. i like the versatility of leaving it open or zipping it up, but like another reviewer, i wish the top lapel would snap back onto the shoulder because it can flop back and that gets a little annoying. overall, i really like the fitt",5
"1. i like a shorter jacket, but this one was poorly made and poorly fit.

2. the sleeves were way too tight. i'm a size 10 or 12, and the large which would be a 14 had tight sleeves that wrinkled up my arms, and the hem of the sleeve turned inside out.

3. i ordered both a medium (size 10) and a large (size 14) , and neither hung right. the m too tight, and the large too loose in the body and too tight in the sleeves.

4. very polyester with lots of static.

5. cute idea, but not very good in pe",1
It sits a little short but works great for a jacket when you don't want to have a big winter coat when going out.,5
"I absolutely love this sweater. it's soft, and delicate. i bought a green one which flatters my skin tone. i feel that i can wear it for three seasons, except summer... lol

it runs a bit large. i normally wear size medium for tops from retailer, but the size s of this sweater fits better than size m. the sleeves are bit long than other sweaters, but i think that's the style, as shown on the model.

if you like feminine and romantic tops/sweaters, you will like this piece. :)",5
"I purchased this in both the green color and the grey color and am in love with both. they are much longer than last years design and it has a pretty weave to the sweater with multiple layers that sit perfectly past the hips. the fit is true to size although the fabric is quite thin and i worry about pulls. also, the sleeves are a bit long, but this doesn't bother me too much at this point. very versatile!",5
"For years i've eyed these printed pilcro cord leggings. every single year in every single incredibly cool print - i've always wanted them. finally i decided to try them on after we got this green and navy print, and i'm so glad i did. these are dreamy! they are so stretchy and so comfortable! they hold snug against your leg for a very streamlined fit, but plenty of stretch so movement is no issue. the print is my favorite part. the colors are extremely fun, but still classy enough to not feel to",5
"Love that it is light and very comfortable. i got both colors, the only thing is it's dry clean only. love that i got it on sale!",5
Beautifully cut and styled!its versatile and can be paired with trousers or a skirt,5
"This is simply the most lovely, interesting, flattering sweater ever. i got the green which is a lovely minty color. couldn't be happier!",5
"This is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater. the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw. but it is lightweight and delicate. i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly. i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness, i had to say no. i will watch for sale.",5
"I was in my local retailer to scope out a different piece, when i spotted this very attractive, well-designed jacket. sparrow's jacket looks dynamite on. the scale is perfect for me; the high level of detail is ideal. i chose this over getting an oversized sweater coat: it felt like these proportions were most flattering on my body. it will be appropriate for work or nice casual events. i bought the medium, true to size; i am an 8 top, 5'1""130#, 34f. although i largely buy online, sometimes you ju",5
"I am obsessed with the off the shoulder trend this season. i were mind on the shoulders so its work appropriate, and you can still tuck it in. the length is perfect. the colors are awesome. t paired it with a pair of pilco cords. it easily work with a skirt or dress pants.
i would highly recommend!!!",5
"This caftan is very light and well-made. i love the colors and designs on this fabric. i was worried that it might make me look boxy, but it accentuates my figure surprisingly well. the fabric is so soft!!! i'm amazed at the price because this is a really beautiful cover-up.",5
I needed a pink dress for a local breast cancer awareness luncheon. this is a perfect fit for the occasion!,5
"This dress is as flattering as wrap dresses usually are. the x-small fits well (dress probably runs a tiny bit large as i go between a small and extra small), though i did move the tiny snap at the neckline down as it fastened too high for me. the dress did snag slightly in one spot but overall, it is really very flowing and lovely on, with unusual colors that look nice with late summer tan and gold earrings.",5
"I ordered the white in 0p (i wanted red, but was sold out and don't have a white one so thought why not). i really liked the fit, flirty, flattering, very nice (love the crossed straps in the back). as someone mentioned, the fabric is a bit heavy for summer, but since i spend a lot of time indoors in a cold environment, no biggie, i probably will have a seater on top of it too. the cut is flattering, chest area not too snug, and i can wear a strapless (more comfortable for me). 115 lbs, 26.5 in",5
"I had high hopes for this dress but my husband said i looked pregnant and that i was wearing a tablecloth- and he was right! i'm usually a size 10 so perhaps this would look good on a talk lanky person with a very long torso... but probably not. way too much fabric around the midsection. it's a shame because the fabric was really pretty, but too stiff a hand to drape well.",1
"I found this in-store when looking for a dressy, slightly boho dress for an upcoming wedding. i'm really happy with it -- the a-line cut disguises some recently gained extra pounds but it doesn't feel like i'm hiding in a muumuu because the shoulders and chest are relatively fitted. the flowy hemline offsets the short length (maybe 4-5"" above the knee for me). the pink color is very light -- lighter than in the photos, i think -- but it will work nicely for the wedding. as the first reviewer sai",5
Love this dress! it is so comfortable and can be worn as casual or dress up.,5
Perfect! can't believe how inexpensive this is for the look. it looks just like it does on the model. i can't wait to wear it on my vacation.,5
"I first spotted this on an retailer employee, she paired it with a peasant top & wore it open w/jeans & boots- so darn cute. love how this peice transitions from summer to fall. i'm 5'4"" so i had to order the small petite which is perfect. note that this dress is very long! it's just a must have garment. the colors/ print are just beautiful.",5
"Saw this in the store in pink....very cool dress but i want black so i'm ordering it. the fabric was almost lace-like & it comes w a slip. it was sort of swingy, and designed to be a-line. loved it. the bell sleeves totally make it.",5
"This is a fun dress to have in your closet! i ordered the 4p, and it was just a little to short for my taste. had the regular 4 sent, and it was perfect! i wore it the very next night to a party... feels great and lots of fun with the bel sleeves!",5
I am simply mad about this dress. i am smaller on top with larger hips. my bust is a mellow b but i could see this working on a or c cups also. this dress is extremely flattering for my body type and the bodice fits like it was made for me. it fits fine without a bra and just perfectly with a semi padded strapless. i got this dress to wear to a summer wedding. the texture and color are beautiful and i will pair with simple jewelry and nude heels. it's a great find and excellent quality. definite,5
This is a great maxi dress for people that want a classic fit but nothing tight. it is figure flattering yet modest enough to wear to work. i am 5'3 (and a half!) and many maxis are so long that i must wear heels. this one is perfect length for me and can be worn with flats or heels.,5
"When this dressed first debuted, i pretty much ignored it because i was not looking for a sleeveless maxi dress for fall. then i went on instagram and saw all the marvelous ways retailer employees were styling this. this can be worn as a long vest over jeans or a long sleeve maxi. and the rich autumn colors go well with boots and sweaters. add a wide leather belt when it's opened or closed, works great either way. when i bought my dara vegan leather moto in plum, i knew this would be an ideal pair",5
"Color is beautiful, fits perfectly, lace is lovely and cut is feminine and flattering. hoping to top with a sweater so i can wear it longer in the season.",5
"This is a wonderful dress. i love the fit and feel of the fabric. i have been looking for a while for a 'fall' maxi to wear with a pair of free people boots i purchased. this dress is perfect with them. the colors are fall and fresh, can i say that about fall?",5
"I already knew that it's not the lightest summer dress by reading previous reviews.
yes, it is fully lined with stretchy fabric which is kind of thick and heavy for skinny straps. i still love this dress it's very beautiful and versatile. it's perfect for san francisco summer it never gets too hot anyway. 
the color is also beautiful but it's little pink side of red.
i am 5'4 size 0 it fits perfect just like the picture.",5
I was a little skeptical about this one at first. i have a hard time with the over all styling of many maxi dresses. i liked the print and figured i would give this a whirl. it is beautiful! looks great on and i love the fabric!! so happy i picked this one up.,5
This dress is breathtaking! it is super lightweight and will be the perfect addition to my suitcase for summer travels! can be dressed up or down with jewelry & heels.,5
"I debated whether or not to order this dress. i love the cut and style, but i was afraid the color would not work for me. with dark hair and pale skin, yellow tends to wash me out. i was correct, but the dress was adorable. definitely size down. i usually wear a medium or 8 in retailer dresses, but based on other reviews, i ordered this in a small. might could have used an extra small. this dress certainly won't show off those 10 pounds you lost, but it is very comfortable and not overly boxy. als",5
Wow! i saw this dress in the store and had to try it on. it is simply stunning! the bright colors and design are a true tracy reese dress and i looked like a fairy queen in it! lol. i can't wait to wear it!,5
"I love the fit and the color. i would buy this t-shirt again in other patterns and colors. the fabric is thin and lightweight, but i knew that when i bought it. ( apparently, nothing this is a problem for some others.) i do choose to wear a camisole or a tank top underneath it. to preserve the fabric, i hang dry after laundering. the colors have not faded, and the fabric is holding up well. i am 5'4"", weigh 134 lbs, and do typically wear size medium.",5
I bought this tee in purple. went back the next day and purchased the peach! this is a classic tee with a girly twist! cute with jeans and a jean jacket!,5
"I now own this shirt in 4 different styles. although i don't expect it to last forever, thus far, they wash really well given how thin they are and light weight. i love the simple cut, and how good they look dressed up or down. it is so hard to find comfy tees, and this one fits the bill! my only wish is that they sold it in solid print colors like white and black. then i would own 6 ;)",5
"Runs a little small, but is very chic!!! you can wear it with jeans and a white t-shirt and you are going to look awesome!!!",5
"I saw this piece and fell in love with it. the print is beautiful and is well placed on every piece! it is a little boxy, and is a bit warm for indoors, but it is unusual enough to overlook the flaws. i am 5'10"". usually a small, but sized up to a medium with this one.",5
The blouse is as shown in the picture. it falls nicely and is flattering to wear. the detail on the yoke and hemline is of good quality. i've received a lot of compliments on this top.,5
Got a ton of compliments.  great tee with beautiful print.,5
This product is amazing. i love that it's comfortable and stylish at the same time. i love the unique color pattern and the length of this product. i also love that i can wear to any occasion and can dress it up or dress it down. it's very versatile and i love it.,5
Ordered this with my bday discount - the small felt a bit roomy so i took it to the store so i could possibly exchange for an xs. i literally could not even get my arm in the xs! tried a different small which was more fitted than the small i had received - so i would say the sizing can be inconsistent,5
"Just beautiful! the details and the colors are combined in such an usual and chic way. the fit is really comfortable too--i found that the jacket runs tts, maybe even a bit large, but i purchased my regular size so that i could wear layers. keep in mind, i have a rather large bust, so someone with a smaller one could probably size down. please note, there are no closures in the front of the jacket, but it looks almost closed when you're wearing it.",5
Great shirt.  love the detail in back.  feminine and different than the average t,5
"This t-shirt is very casual, so it is perfect for everyday use. 
touch of textile is comfortable, so i feel relaxed whenever wearing this t-shirt. 
although stripe is a simple design, it does not limit your choise of fashion, so it can go with almost anything. 
just be aware that this t-shirt runs a little larger than the true size.",5
I love florals and this top can be worn with jeans and also i have worn it for work. it's very comfortable and light.,5
This is the perfect holiday dress. my best purchase of the season!,5
"I found this in store last weekend and thought it was it perfect. i got the size small which had plenty of space for me, usually a 4-6 or small (34a-28-26).
it's long, i found it to be just below knee length (5'6"").
if you zoom in, you can see some detail work along the front edges which complements the pretty openwork in back.
it has pockets too btw :)
this will be worn over everything this summer, let's hope the poly/rayon/spandex blend washes ok!",5
I've been looking for a cozy sweater dress for a while because everything always seems to be so form fitting. i'm between an xs and a small and i got the small for this and it's just a little roomy so it's perfect. fabric is pretty thin so it drapes well and it won't be too warm.,5
"I love this dress because it is amazingly feminine and easy to wear. i put this dress on and immediately felt elegant, sophisticated, and flirty all at the same time. a few tailoring uniquenesses i want to mention; stretchy, form fitting, sexy sheer upper and front back panel, you can wear a bra and not see it thru the sheer front and back portions of the dress, the waist is exactly tailored to show off back side. it is true to size.",5
"I love this tee, i bought it in white and the bright salmon pink and wished i could have bought it in all the colors. the v-neck is low enough to show just a hint of cleavage without being too revealing. the rough edge of the hem is a nice touch. i like the double-v neck in the back as well as front; it adds a little interest to the back and is not too low. the label is sewn on with red thread which shows up on the white color in back but in a nice way. overall the length and cut are just ideal.",5
"Very soft and lovely t-shirt. beautiful flowered print and cute detail on neck. i am 140 lbs and 5' 4"" and got a large.",5
"I love this t-shirt because it has the combination of elegance and relazation to a ""t"".
it's soft, pretty and covers my wide bottom well.",1
"I bought this top in 2 colors -- white and light green. i really like them both. the shirt is a nice weight and texture and the soft green color is really nice. the fit is true to size. i am 5'-6"" and 145 lbs. and the medium was perfect. i like how the back dips in a slight v as well.",5
"Absolutely gorgeous.  i never have been a yellow person but today i am converted.  all the colors are vibrant and true to the photo. i'm 5'6 and the length is perfect for flat sandals and my wedges, so i can dress it up or be stunningly casual.  i range from 14-16/ l-xl in retailer dresses.  the size is dictated by my broad shoulders. since this one is sleeveless i went with the large and it's perfect.  the nude slip has clasps to keep the straps in place and its adjustable. the slip is als",5
"I bought this top about 3 weeks ago& love it! i like it because it's better than a plain t-shirt so it's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping. i like the material and the length, i'm 5'8"" and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short. i wash it and hang it to dry, no shrinking or pilling so far! i am ordering this in at least two more colors!",5
I think 56 reviews says it all! basic tee with a little tailoring on upper back in a variety of colors. i purchased the purple floral tee in my local store and it is prettier in person than on the website. much more vibrant in color. it is tts.,5
"Will be cute in the summer months and with a pair of sweater tights will work for holiday parties. doesn't seem to come in a petite which is a bummer so i sized down.
.",5
"Ordered this top in navy with white irregular dots since it was not available in smaller sizes in the store. i took a chance and ordered an xs and the size and fit are perfect! love the scalloped edge, small side slits and the crocheted detail on the top. great addition to my florida wardrobe!",5
Tts and comfortable. this t shirt brings flair to everyday wear and i purchased on sale for a steal!,5
"Gorgeous with that retailer uniqueness.

unfortunately this shade of yellow just wasn't right for me.

but it is a beautiful dress",5
I purchased this dress in pink. it is absolutely beautiful. the shimmery detail around the neck is gorgeous! it is so flattering and looks amazing with boots or sandals! this dress will not disappoint!!,5
"Beautiful dress. the color in person in a rich golden sun, not too flashy. a very warm hue, it will compliment every skin tone. it is more fitted than most peasant dresses. not as much flowing material, very flattering. the slight beading on the yoke makes it a standout. very well made, with a nice cotton lining. i am usually a size six in a dress, and the small fit beautifully, even with my large top. it is a stunner, that can be worn with boots or sandals. you will receive a lot of compliments",5
I'm dying for this skirt in the picture. where is it??,5
"This duster is a nice light weight dark navy that you can throw on to add a little something to a your outfit without adding bulk or warmth. looks nice over dress, jeans, crops. just a fun little item to have in you closet that you can grab to put a little twist to an outfit. best part of the duster....it has pockets!! i love being able to slide my iphone into a pocket while on the go!",5
"I got this shirt in black, and it's perfect for the office. i ordered a medium, which i thought was a little on the larger side. well made, the details make it an interesting top.",5
"When i walked into the store, this tee instantly caught my eye. it's light weight, not too low cut and longer in the back. great with jeans, skirts or shorts.",5
"This jacket is well made and the fit is perfect. it is quilted and will work well three seasons of the year. it goes with jeans, cords and flannel, and would work with skirts and dresses. colors are a bit more muted and darker than my display shows, but only slightly. studs and black trim really punch up the look of this jacket. i am very pleased with it!",5
Was looking for the perfect birthday dress....and i found it! gorgeous! i generally wear a size 0 or 2 but opted for a size 4 to give some wiggle room and it still fit me like a glove.,5
Got the mustard and grey. very cute. looking forward to wearing it,5
"I purchased this for a late summer wedding that i was invited to last minute and i can't wait to wear it! i got it on sale with an additional percentage off and for the price it is a steal. like all of tracy reese designs it is so cute and feminine. it runs just a tad bit on the larger side so the medium fit my size 10 figure perfectly (i tried on the large and it was too big and too long for me). the medium length was perfect for my height (5""6).",5
Just received this dress in the mail and i'm in love.  it's beautiful and fits so well.  i was a little hesitant ordering a yellow dress but i'm so happy that i did.  ??,5
"I tried both the xs and s in the store. i am usually an xs, but ended up buying the s, because the xs was really short and i didn't want it to be any shorter after washing. the s fit more like a normal t-shirt, although the back is longer. love the color (blue) and the fabric is super soft. also happy that it's not too thin, nor see-through.",5
"I have bought several tees by t.la and this one is really cute. i bought it in the blue stripe size xs. it runs slightly larger than most in that size, but it will probably shrink a little. it's not overly baggy, just comfy fit. i like the colors in this top and will wear it often with shorts or jeans. the fabric is thin so i'm not sure how long it will last, but until then it will be a keeper in my closet!",5
"This jacket is extremely good quality, has gorgeous detailing and is warm! quilting makes it thicker than expected, but plan to wear as both a blazer and fall jacket. highly recommend.",5
"Ok ladies....you need to know that this type of fabric is the one that will get holes (i bought the white one). it is super thin and lovely, but i was only able to get two wears out of it. i did wash it and it maintained it's size because i restretched it while wet then hung to dry. i was super disappointed about the wear but appreciated being able to return it without question at my local retailer.",1
The shirt was soft and very flattering on. got multiple compliments.,5
"I noticed a xxs p at the store. i thought they would never fit me since i am an xs, but i decided to try for fun and to my surprise they fit perfectly. i love it! very stylish and flattering.",5
Great basic but with a little something special to it. great t all around!,5
"These tights are exactly what i was looking for! they are a great weight for the winter months and can be worn out/dressed up or for lounging around at the house. they are a nice weight and durable construction. i plan to pair them with skirts, tunics and dresses. they are super cute with ankle boots.",5
"This romper is absolutely gorgeous. the embroidery is detailed and lovely and the fit is feminine and flattering. it's super versatile and easy to dress up or dress down depending where you want to wear it. i'm in love! 
it is a little on the sheer side, though, and i chose to wear a tank top underneath for more coverage, but this was an easy fix. it was a reasonable trade off to wear a camisole under in exchange for the lightweight and flowy material. totally obsessed.",5
"I had seen this online a few times and while it caught my eye because of the color, i never really bothered to check out the details due to the stock photo. it looks quite bland as it doesn't really flatter the model. however, once i saw this dress in-store, i was drawn to it immediately. the dress is well made, the embroidery is delicate and beautiful with interesting design features. i love the combination of the summer dress with a collar. it makes this dress so work appropriate as well as it",5
Ordered these to wear around the house more as leggings and they did the trick. love the color and the fact that they are warm without being too thick.,5
"Given that tunics and thigh-length dresses are the hot new thing this season, i kept finding that my black-only-tights collection wasn't going to fly with my cute new tops and boots. so i searched far and wide for different colored tights that didn't look cheap or inauthentic in color, and found these. i bought them in blue, gray, and brown and i have worn them with so many different pieces! they look more ""rustic"" than the average tight, almost like they are leggings, not tights. they are a lit",5
"I was a little hesitant to order this dress due to the cotton/polyester blend...not generally a fan of poly for summer. it is high quality though, very soft, lightweight and lays beautifully. it's not see through either, which seems like a rare find in clothing lately. the embroidery is very well done too, and i think it adds just the right touch of feminine, while not being overly ""precious"". it does run small by a whole size, which i've found to be typical of eva franco dresses. i am usually a",5
"I wear tights all winter. it's difficult to find cute, fashionable tights that aren't ""heavy"" and have quality fabrics that will last through an entire season. these fit great, don't roll or bunch, don't shrink, have great feeling fabric and aren't super thick... but not see thru! love these and plan on purchasing in all of the colors!",5
"Just received first pair in brown...love them and ordered two more! these tights actually stay up and you don't have to keep pulling on them throughout the day. super comfortable and perfect weight, not too thick and not too thin. they will run, so be careful when washing or putting them on.",5
"I loved the look of this sweater, but the workmanship was surprisingly poor. there were missed stitches, and loose threads throughout, and even a tag sewn to the outside. retailer was great about the return. i really wanted to keep it and was very disappointed.",1
These tights are awesome! i bought three pairs. they give a nice casual look to some of my multi-season dresses.,5
"I love this sweater. it's warm, comfortable, and soft. nice quality too.",5
Perfect substitute for leggings to wear with a long shirt skirts or shorts. and are thick enough to keep you warm and aren't as thin as some tights normally are.,5
"This romper is so dang cute. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium in this though either size would probably have worked depending how loose you like it. it's not too sheer and the shorts aren't too short (i'm 5'9). my only complaint is the front toe came off on one side as i was trying it on, an easy fix but still it should come off that easy.",5
"Love this romper! very impressed that even though the material is ivory colour, it's not sheer and undergarments won't show through. a forgiving fit for everyone",5
The tights are thin and not how they appear in the photo. one of my pairs had a hole in the seat and it was obvious they had been repackaged with part of the packaging missing. very disappointing. i wish i had found the hole before i try them on. they are definitely going back.,1
"I am so happy with this chemise! the pink is the most breathtaking blush and the fabric is super soft. i like that the straps are adjustable, allowing me to make the bodice a perfect fit while adjusting the gown to the perfect length for me. it's definitely my new favorite!",5
"Such a pretty little sweater, gorgeous detail. i wish it were a bit longer, it was too boxy for my large chest. otherwise it fits tts. i wanted to lie inside of it and take a nap. so comfortable. please make more sweaters in this knit!",5
"And flattering! i love the feel of the dress, it is flowy, loose but still flattering. i can't wait to wear it with boots. i could go with flats for summer, too, if i wanted to. i have had this dress in my wish list, then i deleted it, but it was in the store as a return in xxs p so i thought, why not! i shouldn't have really, coz now i have to get it... and i did.

colors are actually great, i don't know why people have issues ""matching"" - black or navy are equally neutral in my books...

f",5
"This dress is cute and comfortable. big but not too big, skimming. i usually wear a 12 pant and bought a medium and it is great. i am on the taller side and the length was great too.",5
"I love this dress! it's super comfortable--soft fabric and doesn't bind anywhere--yet somehow it's still feminine and sexy. i get compliments on it wherever i go! also, it works all year-round (in winter it can be easily paired with boots, tights, a long-sleeved black t-shirt, etc.).",5
Well made & lined. great find for the fall!,5
"I am short (5'3'"") and have a short torso so the empire waist line was really flattering. i got the petite size small and it fell just above my knee. loose skirt portion led to an easy look to the dress. overall, super cute!",5
"This is such a unique design and i love the colors. i could be a small or x-small and chose the x-small, fits perfectly.",5
"Really cute, really comfy, great color, love the oversize buttons! all around just a great skirt. nice shade that goes right into fall. i have several of this style skirt and love them all!",5
This really is a lovely shirt . i like the long length of the sleeves as sleeves are often too short on me to wear cuffed at the wrist. i now have the option of long or rolled up sleeves. the fabric is the perfect weight for indoors. it is definitely a keeper.,5
"This is a basic that i've been looking for for ages. i've never found such a flattering plain white button down shirt before -- everything is either not basic enough, unflattering shape, too masculine, too boring, too wrinkly, or too hard to take care of. this shirt is perfect. it is shaped to flatter, but doesn't have any finicky details. this is just a wardrobe staple, plain and simple. it is going to work hard for me, year round. i have other cloth & stone tops, and have loved them all. their",5
Bought this for a vacation to mexico with my boyfriend. super flattering and soft. big thumbs up!,5
"I'm normally a size small, but the store only had a large. i tried it on and it still fits great as an oversized button down for a threw-on-my-boyfriends-shirt kind of look. i wear it tied in a knot with leggings.

the shirt is so so so soft and high in quality.",5
Wore for the 4th with white jeans super cute love the ruffle,5
Really love this top even more than i expected based on the picture. i have already worn it 6 times in a short period of time. it's been a great fall top,5
"This is a fantastic dress. it's very flowy, comfortable, stylish, and it has pockets!!! whoop! whoop! i have a larger bust (34d) and even though it's button down, the openings in between don't peak open to show your bra. it is navy and red, but i think you could wear black boots with it, no problem. this is my new favorite dress and i'm very happy with my purchase. buy it!!",5
"I disagree with a previous review saying that this top is unflattering and boxy. i bought this top and it actually looks just like the image in the photo online. i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i wore it with black skinny jeans, black tall boots and a short sleeve cardigan which i used as a jacket, and did not keep on the entire night. i think the shirt even looks good without being tucked in. :) i really love it. maybe just wish i could button the top from time to time to change",5
"This shirt can look very elegant thanks to the nice duffs and hidden button line. the material is pleasantly substancial and very soft. the only thing i did not like is that the bottom button broke it two pieces the tirst tme i buttoned it. no spare buttons included, but as the buttons are not visible i think i can find a similar one to replace it. not big enough of an issue to return,",5
Absolutely perfect staple top to have in your wardrobe. fits very nicely. not see through at all. highly recommend this top.,5
I love this gown so much. i have two of them! the gray and pink. they are really soft and comfortable. i sleep in them all of the time.,5
"First, i'm an 8/10 and tried the s and m. i could've worn either but the m looked too large in my opinion. i kept the small. the color- i think you could wear black or navy as the navy is very very dark. the only con- the sleeves. they stick right out to the sides and don't lay down as much as the online photo. it definitely looks best with a cardigan or jacket over it. material is super light.",5
"I got the black in size small. i love this easy, breezy and comfy t. i love that it's different and can wear with anything. the shirt is more flowy vs fitted which i like. i wish they had more colors! i could see myself wearing this shirt a lot this summer. 

i'm a size 2 and bought a small.",5
"This top is a great neutral layering piece with some nice visual interest. the black-and-white pattern and tie-neck style will add a little something to a cardigan or blazer. the neck can also be tied multiple ways. it's definitely appropriate for work and i found it tts. i normally wear a 10/m, and took an m in this top.",5
"I just got this top in the mail and love love love it! i thought it was on the pricey side for a shirt, but couldn't help but purchase it full price because i love anything pineapple print! the metallic print is cute and chic from day to night. i also love the open shoulders, making this design different and perfect for summer. i'm only sorry that i didn't see this top online until i already returned from my vacation in maui! very comfortable and easy, worth the price!",5
"This skirt has a unique, fun pattern and a fit that is absolutely perfect. just figure flattering without being too tight or revealing. can't wait to wear it for a holiday dinner.",5
"I'm in love with this skirt! i already have so many outfits planned out! i do feel it runs slight large, maybe half a size?? i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and usually wear a 6. i ordered a small, and it's fairly loose, but i like that personally. if you want a tighter pencil look, then size down.",5
"I love this skirt. it is stylish and very comfortable. ladies, don't be afraid of wearing a pattern on the bottom. it is flattering and slimming. i wear it with a black wrap sweater or black cotton casual jacket.",5
"I ordered both colors and my usual size (in eptites) and one size smaller... definitely true to size as in not smaller size. 

i am 5'1.5"" and the best size was xs petite. 

i ordered both colors and msut say they are both gorgeous, so can't go wrng there, as long as it goes with your skin tone, for me the red was better, but i did love hte neutral color as well.

comes with a lining #bude color#.
wasit is elasticized, and comfortable, love the sleeves, this is light enough for spring and",5
"I am 5'9"" and 138 pounds slender, but with a tummy. the small fit great ,and i agree with the other reviewer that the elastic waist band is complimentary. the dress flounces out a little, but in a cute way, and it's not too short compared to so many other baby doll dresses out there now. i didn't think it looked that great on the hanger, but when i tried it on it looked so much better than i expected. got the brown. thank you to the other reviewers for the bootie, boot, moto jacket transition to",5
"Retailer has the greatest pencil skirts. i usually get 1 every year. the pattern on this one makes it very eye catching with blue birds on green or tan background and black and white flowers in a tree pattern. so it is versatile to wear with many colored tops.
i bought a large because they didn't have medium in the store. it is a bit loose in the waist but comfortable . the rest fits nice and slim. i am usually an 8-10 in jeans.",5
"If you love denim skirts as much or more than you love the perfect pair of jeans, then you'll love this one! the waist fits perfectly with just enough give from the spandex to make this skirt comfortable all day without stretching so much that you'll wonder if you should've bought a smaller size. it's also a great length for fall/winter and looks fabulous with boots. i just wish i could find the perfect buttondown shirt so i can tuck it in and show off the cute detail buckle in back!",5
"It is very hard to find a great midi denim skirt. pomona's is very stylish, well made, and looks great on. i had to exchange my size 10 for a size 12 and am awaiting its arrival, remaining hopeful it will provide a better fit. first time in my life i have purchased a 12 so can't say for sure whether the skirt runs small or i am now running larger. i recommend this skirt.",5
Love this tshirt! casual but can be dressed up with wedges and a scarf!,5
"The model in this photo should be standing tall, because this dress looks absolutely fabulous right out of the tissue paper! i ordered a small, and am 130pounds 5'5""- the dress fits like a glove, and is a pull over style. the nude slip- lining connected to the outer shell works wonders and allows for a full coverage feel, yet nice breezy, sexy appeal. this dress can be worn to work, on a hot date, and even a nice weekend look. when i say slimming i mean it. the center detail- grabs the most perf",5
"Even following the care label exactly, it shrunk ~3 inches in the length and overall in the diameter. i had to return this since i am tall and it looked more like a work-inappropriate mini after the first wash.",1
I feel really cool wearing this skirt :-) a nice alternative to the jeans that are my standard uniform. loooks great with short boots. i'm wearing it as i write this review--and was wearing it all day. awesome skirt!,5
"I am 5'6"" and run between a size 9-10 pant. i ordered the size 10 skirt and the waist fit perfectly and so did the back of the skirt, which i was afraid might be loose (i don't really have a butt but it fits nicely). looks like the picture so the skirt goes straight down, it does not taper to smaller width like some regular pencil skirts might so the bottom part will not be fitted, for your reference. the denim actually has quite a lot of stretch so it's very comfortable as well as the waistband",5
"I bought this in the neutral motif and my expectations before trying it on weren't high but i was sold once i was in the dress. sometimes dresses that have the elastic band in the waist can be tricky if you don't have a perfectly flat tummy and can accentuate the tiniest bump. however, this dress sits perfectly on the waist and is actually super slimming. i wasn't 100% sold on the pattern or color (i wish it was more off white than brown) but the fit was so great that i had to buy it! the dress",5
"Ordered this in the neutral motif, size large and it's a great little dress. comfortable and cute, but modest enough that i'm not worried about my bust (38d) hanging out too much. the v-neck hits at the perfect spot. the sleeves are the perfect 3/4 length, not too tight and it's not too short on me (5'9""). i'm a light blonde and i don't feel washed out in this. it hides a little belly well without being a tent. also, the lining is super soft and flexible. the only problem is the upper back falls",5
Great dress that can be casual or dressy. well-made and comes with.a built-in slip.,5
"I just received this dress and it so adorable with the pineapple print, really flattering on and very well made. the shoulder styling and cut out in the back makes it really stand out for style. the con for this cute styling is it is not bra friendly no matter what bra you wear. even strapless will show in the back cut out as it is open where most bras go. it has handy side pockets and fits very true to size. i'm a 12 in most dresses and the 12 fit perfectly everywhere. but, i am sending it back",5
"Love this top-i love the colors, flow and that you can wear with a regular bra and straps are covered. i was torn between the xs and s but went with the s due to length. have already worn several times with a casual white jean summer skirt and crops. love love love.",5
Perfect for day at the beach! i'm 5'6 and the length is just right above knee not too short. fresh and cool cotton. comfortable feel.,5
"Absolutely gorgeous!
words can't describe the beauty of this dress!
i hope they will restock it cause i would order size s (didn't know how it runs).",5
"This top is gorgeous and better than the web photo. i love that it goes with the off-the-shoulder trend while allowing for a normal bra - in fact, it even has the little snaps at the shoulders to hold your straps in place (awesome detail). the ruffled portion looks good over or under your arms, length hit at about my hip (5'7"" with long torso; 125lbs, 32b) and, and it has an overall flowy but not sacklike fit. i found this to fit tts (bought my usual s). beautiful vivid print looks great with wh",5
I agree with the other reviewers about sizing down in this tee. the colors are beautiful and design lovely. i love how the sleeves are finished and the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the flower days tee (that i purchased in a larger size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!,5
"When i first saw this i thought it was a bit boxy but i was drawn to the colors. the arm-holes are a little large and i got an xs (normally wear a size 2), so i will probably wear a tank underneath, but overall the fit is relaxed and comfortable. i love the colors. it has a little longer length (i'm 5'5""). i see this being cute with white jeans, blue jeans. love it!",5
"I ordered the red in xl and the fit on me matches the photos on the model. it's true to size. the quality of the material is fantastic. the stitched upper portion is well-done. the color is much prettier in person. it's such a bright, cheerful, well-made top. i washed mine and air dried it. fits & looks great after washing. this is a bargain, especially on sale. the red combo is such a unique mix of colors. i like using blue jewelry with it. but, also mint green jewelry too.",5
"The fabric is very soft, love the purple floral color. the top is very flattering with the ease and comfort of a t-shirt.",5
"Great dress for a full figure.
forget about the horizontal stripes. you can wear this with great style and get away with wearing those dreaded stripes. the possibilities have been great because i wear this dress with sweater vests, athletic vests, sweaters, jackets and wool scarves. i have worn this dress with cowboy boots, dress boots and pumps and it looks great with all options. the material is thick enough that panty lines don't show. women of different ages stop me and tell me they want thi",5
"Great shirt, more of a stretch to it than i thought it would. very flowy, looks great with jeans & leggings.",5
"This dress is chick but funky! the material is knit but not the usual itchy knit. it's comfortable and cool. the colors of the stripes are cool - they're earthy and go well with black, brown, blue and gray. this is going to be a favorite for years.",5
"Loved this blouse the moment i tried it on! it is one of ""those"" items for me. it does run large so size down. if you are concerned about the arms don't be. i usually go between a medium and large and the medium was perfectly roomy without being to large.",5
"Love this shirt. the print is a little loud, but cute. i always upsize shirts due to my bust size and not liking them to be too clingy. however, that was a mistake with this shirt. there was too much fabric around the midsection with the larger size. i did like it enough to order again in the correct size (l). i am a size 14 and busty, if that helps. the red is short-sleeved, by the way if ordered online, cute and flattering.",5
"I have four kids and a post baby bump that wants to live on forever, so i'm a huge fan of flowy tops--this one looked cute online, but i wasn't sold on it and passed. then i went to the store the next day and saw it, and the colors were more vibrant, so i thought, why not try it on, though i wasn't that excited about it. i tried it on and it was like the shirt was having her cinderalla moment--totally transformed how it looked on me and in person. i love it! it was one of those instant ""i'm buyi",5
Love this shirt. it's easy to throw on and makes a cute outfit with about any kind of bottoms. i've wore it with leggings and jeans.,5
"This top is soft, comfortable and drapes nicely. the print makes it fresh and different. i sized down to a small.",5
"Perfect fit shirt. super cute and very comfortable. i purchased a size xl at first but it was too large, l fit perfect. i'm normally a size 14 on top, but this runs large.",5
"A great white blouse! i expected this top to be sheer and yet it's quite opaque. i bought the white in a size small, i find it true to size and the silhouette is very flattering. relaxed yet super polished look.",5
Absolutely love this top. followed reviewer advice to size down and got the medium. good choice and probably could have gotten a small. love the fabric and pattern. it's so light and pretty. love the marriage of bare shoulders with sleeves.,5
This dress is amazing. bought in orange and fits wonderfully. great quality and could transition in between seasons,5
"I love shift dresses and i love t linen so this one was a must for me. i had it in my inbox as soon as it came out on the website and then i found it in the store and had to try it on. i took the six and the eight to the fitting room because i run in between, and the six fit better so i guess it runs a little bit large. really it just depends on how you want it to fit. the length is great too, about 3 inches above my knee, i'm 5 foot 5, which is exactly where i like my dresses to hit. i got the",5
"I purchased this in store and the red motif is short sleeved as pictured. the pattern is fun, vibrant and great for summer months. it's a more substantial weight fabric, not sheer or clingy. the fit is tts and it is a slightly longer length which i loved.",5
"Purchased this in the burnt orange color - very nice!
will be lightweight for our hot, humid summers but has a bit of pizazz with the lace up front.
the slip is nicely made with strap attachments in the shoulders so they do not slip.
i wear a ton of dresses in the summer so this will definitely be a go to item for all the horse races we attend. 
looking forward to snagging a nice derby style hat to match!",5
I love this piece !   i purchased it on sale months ago and when  i wear it i just love it!!  it looks great with every outfit the neutral colors perfect it's very light very hip looking one of my very favorite pieces of clothing  i'm very petite and i believe only the small was available but fits fine  would love more of these genuine leather pieces at purchasable prices   thx retailer!,5
"This product is made of good-quality cotton material. it does run a little large, but it still fits nicely. i like the fact that the design is both on the front and face of the garment.",5
"I saw an outfit post of a gorgeous lady in this dress so i had to try it. it's so flattering and well constructed, if a little longer than i usually prefer. i'll just have to wear pumps with it. i don't have the right bra so i just pinned the straps to a bit of ribbon in front to pull them underneath the dress. it does have pockets, also. i ordered the 12 and it fits beautifully. for reference i have a 40"" bust and 33"" waist.",5
I just want you guys to be aware that the red print is not short sleeved! we have this in store and both are 3/4 length sleeves! great material and fit.,5
"I ordered the orange motif in short sleeves.and i got what i ordered- and love it. it is a little big, but i wanted a looser top. i was looking for something bright and fun for the spring time that i could wear to work with nice slacks or dress down with jeans. this top meets my needs for sure. i really like the detailing on the top collar-bone area. my husband loved that it was bright and cheerful- so i take this as a win!",5
"This was just what i wanted. a simple design (so many of retailer's suits have way too much going on) and this one fit the bill. sexy, strappy and clean. i can't wait to live in this top this summer.",5
"So happy to say this dress was built for my body type.  i'm heavier & wider in my upper body so the cut of the bodice/halter fits perfectly and comfortably.  going in at the waist and flaring out to a soft a-line, the skirt pleating lays just right since i have no hips or booty.  yes, the fabric is heavier weight, so i wouldn't recommend wearing in hot & humid weather.  i love the unique print & colors!  i do not own anything in this color combination.  the retro vibe is strong in this one so i",5
"I bought this shirt in white, i have worn it 2 ways so far and love it. i wore it under a pull over and had the tail ends stick out and it was great that way, and i wore it with a long cardigan. i received a lot of compliments on it. i will be buying it in red!!",5
The print and fit of this dress is perfect! it's very flattering and slimming.,5
I tried this dress on in the store in the mango color but opted to order the blue. the dress is beautifully made and the fit is fantastic.,5
This shirt would be perfect if i needed a canopy on my tent. this shirt runs ridiculously large. purchased a medium and it should be labeled an xl. no impressed with the pattern in person. looks cheap. will be returning.,1
"I purchased the mango. it is flattering with my olive skin and golden brown hair. i am keeping it. i'm used to linen so no surprises there. i agree with a reviewer that said it will work in summer and fall. i could wear this walking on the beach, to a summer casual dinner party. i plan on wearing gold sandals and gold jewelry. this will make the feel more summertime. then i will wear boots with it in the fall. i'm very happy with the choice. my store didn't have the blue. the fit is tts. i'm 5 f",5
"Really pretty blue top. great for wearing around the house if you want to be comfy and casual yet look good in case your neighbor shows up at your door, of if you have to run a quick errand! if your wear it with distressed jeans it will add to the casual vibe. the blue is vivid and perfect for any hair color. don't get me wrong. the top is casual and cute. it is not sloppy and has an international, worldly vibe. i recommend it.",5
I love the sweater online and even more in person! i paired it with a long sleeve top with a bell sleeve and it looked great!! very bohemian look!,5
I saw this dress on someone and knew immediately i had to have it.  it is stunning in person.,5
"This worked for me, very elegant, cozy and comfortable.",5
Extreme comfort for travel and out door activities.,5
I ordered top and pants online as seen. pants are of good quality and hang beautiful.  i love the color and quality of the fabric. nice and vibrant. nice fit at the top into a flowy drape. the top runs big and glad i ordered down one size. love the outfit for my upcoming island trip.,5
This jacket is beautiful and easily dresses an outfit up and can just as easily be dressed down and worn casually. i consistently wear a size 8/10/m and have this piece in xs. the reviews do not lie - size down!,5
A gorgeous and vibrant print! love the ruffles on the bottom and the detailing of the straps in the back. perfect for a beach day!,5
"Great alternative to yoga pants, these pants are stylish and on-trend but also easy going. dress them up or throw on a hoodie and your look is instantly transformed with very little effort!",5
This is going to be perfect for my daughter's graduation. she is in love with it and it looks amazing on her!,5

"These jeans are amazing. they are so comfortable.  they have a great amount of stretch but do not sag even after wearing them all day. i am 5'4"" and 135 lbs and purchased  my usual size 27. i did have to have them shortened 
but only b/c i bought in store and did not have the petite online option. i have worn them on several occasions. great purchase.",5
I love these pants! they are comfortable and dressy enough for work! the wide leg is the perfect size and the higher waist is professional! these are also nice and long for wearing heels. i ordered a size 27 and they fit great. i normally wear a size 6 in us sizing.,5
"These fit beautifully and are very flattering. they are true to size but may be a little long. i am 5'5"" and wear these with 2 in. heels. i have already had numerous compliments on them.",5
These pants are really cute and comfortable. the fit is very nice.,5
I have always been partial to palazzo pants. these fit like a dream and are very comfortable.,5
"Softest denim -- they feel like they've been through the wash a hundred times already! i'm pleased that the belt is removable as it adds just a bit too much bulk for me. i'm 5'4"" and bought the petite for a perfect fit. these will become a go-to pair!",5
"I love these bottoms they are super cute, comfy and very flatering. finally a bikini botom i feel comfotable in after having my babies. its just high enough to cover my stretch marks on top and the ruffles cover the one down low :) and fits loosly enough to avoid a muffin top. i am normally between a size 8 and ten 145 lbs. and i ordered size large.",5
"I'm really glad i read the previous reviews on this. i'm normally between a 27 or 28. thought a 28 would work best for me seeing that it's high waisted but i recommend sizing down on these guys, the 27 fits very comfortably. 

i""m 5'7 and i can wear them with flats.",5

fit true to size for me, almost had a hard mite buttoning... but they are stretchy, so don't buy a bigger size, they will stretch. could not decide which color to keep so kept both... i ordered the 25p (0p) - i am 5'1.5"", and 115 lbs... i think these are vanity sized, but my usual vanit",5
"I bought these to wear to a christmas party with a lacy blouse, but found they were what's been missing in my life. after wearing them nearly every other day, i decided i needed another pair.

feel like yoga pants but look polished. make your butt look perky and your legs slim. .... maybe i need another pair!",5
"Saw these at my local retailer store and almost didn't try them on. so glad i did. they made my legs look long and lean. they run a little big and i decided to go down a size because i think they may stretch out after wearing for awhile. the material is fairly thick but i think that helped in making them appear to slim my hips, butt and thighs. the material is really pretty stretchy and that made them so comfortable. i love how i look in these!!!",5
"This dress is gorgeous! the colors are deep and rich and the fabric is super soft. the top part is lined but still avoids feeling like it would be too hot when the temperatures warm up. bonus-- a regular bra works perfectly underneath without anything showing, even with the deep v neckline. while the waist does sit a bit high, it works perfectly on my body-- emphasizes the smallest part of my waist and then flows away. it drapes nicely, not too full and not too clingy. i am 5'7 and a true size 6",5
"Great fit and style. the color is perfect for spring, they have a nautical feel to them.",5
"Me: 5'6"", 130, waist 28/39, hips 36/37. tried the size 27, the usual for me in pilcro. they fit like a glove and i loved them. i clearly needed a 2-3"" heel to do them justice and now i see the photos of my rear i'm a bit doubtful but pilcros always stretch a little and these are super soft and funky.
a win!",5
"I bought this dress for my wedding rehearsal dinner. it's beautiful. the material is thicker than i imagined, not a bad thing at all. i ironed it with lots of steam and it came out great. the tie in back is nice because it can be cinched tight or worn more loosely",5
"I bought this in black last year and i love it. i also like the two prints offered here but unfortunately the matching tops aren't really my style and these prints wouldn't be so easy to mix and match. please offer in other solid colors! i would buy all of them, this skirt is really that fabulous. 

not only does it fit well and run true to size, it also comes up a bit further than other swim skirts i have tried on, and gives a little more tummy coverage. but not too much! somehow it hits me a",5

I love these jeans. they are flattering and don't sag after wearing them for a hour or two. they look great with flats or booties.,5
This darling dress has a fun boho vibe to it and the color/pattern would flatter a variety of skin tones. a long necklace is a must with this dress. it has a flowy drape below the waist so it's a generous fit. i purchased the medium.,5
"I ordered this in xs and s. they both fit very well and i couldn't tell much difference between the two. i kept the s as it seemed to have a little more length on it. i am 5'4"" about 120#. i wish this were offered in lots of different solids and more patterns (the taupe and white stripe...hint hint hint) too. it's just perfect. i am in my mid 40s and have young kids so it's great for my life right now! comfortable too!",5
"I ordered the petite size 27 and the fit is just like on the model...not tight at all and very flattering. even the petite length is long on me and i will need to wear wedges or something with a heel but honestly that makes them even more flattering...makes my legs look long! i am 5'4"" and about 118#. the material is so soft and substantial...the color is very accurately portrayed online. i can't wait to wear this fall!",5
"I typically wear a 26 or 27 in jeans, had to size up to a 28 in these. the legs felt fine in the size 27, but the waistband was a bit tight, so i went with the 28s. i am 5'2"" 115lbs. i'll also be hemming or possibly just cutting these off, they are about 4 inches longer on me compared to the model pictured.",5
"I adore these jeans! i bought them in a size 31 but probably could have gone with a 30. i decided to keep them anyway and have been very pleased. the fit is flattering. the color is perfect! i prefer these gray jeans to any other color for most outfits. the waist is a little higher than i'm used to, but that makes the fit even more flattering and helps prevent the ""sagging out"" issue that my older paige skinny jeans have.

i love these jeans and definitely recommend them for hourglass shapes. mo",5
"This dress is gorgeous! i ordered it because i was getting other things and there was free shipping., i am 5'3.5"" and abt 123 lbs. usually between an xs and s and also between reg & petite. sometimes i have to order multiple sizes to get a decent fit. i ordered a sz small petite and it's perfect. super soft, great colors, perfect length!! love it!",5
"These pants are flattering yet comfortable. i am thrilled that they are available in tall sizes because i am 6 feet tall. the 36 inch inseam is perfect and for me prevents the problem of ""high water"" pants. the zippered pockets are flattering yet useful. the high rise waist is wonderful. these pants are perfect for wear in a number of occasions. they are great.",5
"I have never been able to find a maxi dress that just fits me. i'm pretty short (5'2"") and the xs petite comes exactly to my ankles. no hemming necessary! the neckline is very flattering and the waist is a semi-empire elastic waistline that makes this dress both elegant and comfortable. the dress is very stretchy but doesn't look like it. it is absolutely one of my ""summer staples"" now - especially for traveling. if i could have this dress in fifty different patterns i would.",5
"These are the perfect dressy 'jeans'. they are super soft but have the right amount of structure. they sit higher on the waist, which is one reason they are so flattering. the other reason is the flared, long leg! very long, in fact. i'm 5'5, 130 lbs and ordered a size 28. they fit me perfectly but i do have to wear them with my tall heels - which makes them perfect for work, with pumps as well as for casual outfits with tall wedges. if my size wasn't sold out, i'd order another pair - they are",5
Trousers fit tts with nice thick fabric and great fit. the length was perfect for my 5'9 height. they are flattering very nice quality.,5

"I ordered these in the blue size 28p. i am 5' 120 lbs. a size 6p and curvy. the jeans fit very nicely in thigh and hip area (and i don't have skinny thighs). the jean is not a low rise which is what i was looking for. i was looking for a jean that was a little dressier yo wear out to grab a drink or catch a movie. these jeans fit the bill because they give off a polished vibe, especially when paired with a dressier top, blazer, skinny belt and heels. also, i like that the jeans don't have the to",5
"I am a huge fan of all things ""mother"" brand now. they fit great and are true to size! they have just the right amount of stretch, but maintain their fit all day.",5
Runs big so size down. i love this top for many reasons but armholes are big so went to xs and i am usually a small or medium. xs was perfect and still long enough for me. gorgeous fabric and color and flow. got tons of compliments! very feminine and comfy. looks great with jeans and white crops.,5
"Perfect in every way- easy to wear-very feminine, comfy and goes with everything. only problem is color is not like picture. it is a mauve not a light pink. i still love this top and the color it camre in. brighten up with lipstick- necklace- earrings- whatever your pick. highly recommend. a winner!!!",5
"Boxy, short & wide! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design...",1
"This blouse does have a flowy, boxy shape to it but the details make up for that. when i wear it tucked into a skirt it looks wonderfully flattering. i tried on an xs and considered looking for a xxs but i feel that size would probably end up being too short instead of more fitted.",5
"I didn't look at this dress twice online but when i tried it on in the store i was floored. it was beautiful, flattering, and so much fun.",5
"This top is gorgeous in person! i got the small because at 5'5"", 127 pounds and a 30f chest, you never know how a top will fit. however, this one is big. i definitely needed the xs which is now sold out. i'll be taking in the sides because the arm holes show too much bra and there's a ton of extra fabric that makes it way too blouse. love this shirt though and am not willing to part with it!",5
"I am an retailer employee and this top just screamed my name when it arrived in our store. i love the colors and the feminine flair of this top. i am short and this top is a little longer on me than pictured on the model. i like the fact that it is a bit longer, it helps cover up some of my extra assets. the top is to big at the arm holes which is the story i have heard from my customers who did not purchase the top even though they loved it. i should have purchased the xxs online, it would",5
"I got this top in the ""brown"" color, although it is really more of a burnt rose, or light sienna shade and it is just lovely. i love the color. the fit is just right, comfortable and a good length. it feels very well-made and has beautiful details from the pleated collar/neckline to the slightly sheer upper back panel. i have only one tiny issue with this top: in the very front where it buttons, there is no lining or fabric behind the crocheted lace panels. in retrospect, i can see this slightly",5
"I just ordered this top and so far really like it, it is pretty and feminine and comfortable. the one thing i would note is that the lace running down the center has holes which you can see through, unlike the lace to each side. it's not extremely noticeable, but i am planning on wearing a cami under it. i ordered a small and it fits pretty well but is definitely on the looser side, i wonder if possibly the extra small would work for me, but i'm fairly tall so i went with the small.",5
"Super flattering dress. love it. makes my waist look tiny. great fit and flare style without making me look pregnant! i love the fabric. will be great as a travel dress (packs easy, doesn't need to be ironed really, substantial fabric). love it. i think it runs large since i'm rarely a 2 at retailer, but i find that maeve runs all over the place. i'm usually a 4 at retailer and i got a 2 in this.",5
"I love this blouse. it reminds me of something out of europe with the swiss dot and crochet delicate sleeves. i ordered the xsp and it fits perfect. i'm 4' 11"" so the shortness of the top isn't a factor. the material drapes nicely and doesn't make me look wide or boxy. i was afraid that the sleeves were going to be overly puffy put luckily they are not. the only thing to note is that the color is more on the tan / beige side rather than pink. i find with a lot of retailer tops that the colors are",5
"I tried this on in the ivory color because it was on sale and i thought it ""might"" be sort of cute. a comfy, flowy, warmer to cooler weather transition top. little did i know how much i would fall in love with it! i tried it on over like 3 things in the fitting room, including a black strapless maxi dress i wore into the store, and it still looked great! it is comfortable, loose, and goes with pretty much anything (i've tried and still haven't found anything it looks bad over). it's not super dr",5
I tried on this dress in store and was amazed by the quality and simple structure of the dress. bought it with no hesitation.,5
Absolutely beautiful dress. i'm 5'11 and this dress works for tall girls:)),5
"No need to be on the fence about this top, it's lovely! what you see pictured here, is exactly what you get, even the color of the top is 100% accurate. for reference i'm usually an xl/16, apple shape, 40 c bust, and this xl does not cling at all to me, so you may even be able to size down. the drape of the clipdot fabric is flattering, and thick enough not to need a cami. all of the fabrics used are nice and soft... and the details! it's going to be a beautiful spring!",5
"I saw this dress a few weeks ago in the store, tried it on but didn't have anywhere in mind to wear it so i passed. noticed it on sale online and had to order. it is so comfortable and flattering. the material is thicker therefore it keeps a nice shape. not slinky at all.",5
"This top is my favorite spring item. the color is a soft petal, but it doesn't wash me out (i'm a sandy paleface), and the details make it special. the cut is a little wide (i sized down), but it's also forgiving and perfect with slim pants or a pencil skirt. it's really a find.",5
I ordered this on a whim and am so glad that i did. it's a great color shirt and the embroidery is perfect. i like the length of the shirt.,5
"This dress is made of a wonderful, thick material that is flattering. i think the photo doesn't really bring it to life- it's a great dress that can dressed up and is at least a 3 season dress thanks to the colors. the v-neck is a little deep if you are bustier but not inappropriate for a slightly more casual office. it runs a bit large and the fabric has some give so i would potentially size down. i also think if you are more narrow shouldered it might not be the best fit without a nip and tuck",5
I love floreat and was excited to find this top on sale. i received multiple compliments the first day i wore it. it is true that it might be better with a bit less fabric but it wasn't a deal breaker for me. the flowy shape it ideal for summer.,5
I love this tank to wear alone because it is soft and more lovely than a basic plain tank. it is especially great to layer with a sweater/ cardigan. the colors are always fabulous and the design is wonderfully feminine. i own several and love them all. it's a great value especially on sale. i normally wear a size 6 and the small fits perfectly.,5
"I love this top! it is sheer, so wear a cami, but it so pretty, i will wear it a lot! a winner for sure.",5
Beautiful and delicate!!,5
"This dress is beautiful and extremely flattering- i have an hourglass shape, and this dress highlighted that perfectly. the pictures online do not do it justice.",5
"I love the tie-dye look! i ordered the blue color in my usual size small. fit is tts. love it!. just a fyi: 1. on mine, one arm is a darker blue tie-dye, the other is very light (color variation). 2. the white band on the mock-neck doesn't give much, so be careful when putting on/taking off.  i think it's pricey, but ordered during the promo so that made it better. it came yesterday, put it on w/ my washed blue skinny jeans, out to dinner we went!",5
"The top is gorge, it may look somewhat slouchy but it falls perfect and looks great, especially the navy color with white jeans. i liked it so much i ordered the ivory color too. beware the quality of this top is extremely delicate and if you don't want it to snag, do not wear a bracelet that can snag it.",5
"This top is awesome!! it is feminine and flattering at the same time! the color also makes it a little romantic. i will wear it with jeans or very a little dressier night out, black pants. buy this and you will not be disappointed!",5
"For myself it brings out the playful side of me. it is flows and just looks lovely. i wore it with a white denim skirt, and booties. i know white, and it looked great. the fabric is beautiful, and in the sun it is breathtaking",5
Love this dress! accents your curves and slims you waist!,5
"These tights are wonderful, exactly as pictured (but the shimmer is more apparent in person), definitely true to size, and super comfy! the only tricky part is finding the right shoes to pair with.",5
I almost never buy full price but i did with this skirt.  it is adorable! saw it in the store.  it is too short to wear to work but is fine for casual wear.  i am a size 14 but the largest one they had was a 12 and it fit perfectly.  i&#39;d size down. the fabric is stiff and the a-line stands out.  colors are southwesternish.  can be worn with any color top.  i bought a cream colored top to wear with it (that was on the sale rack) but i'm sure there are plenty things in the closet that will go.,5
"I'm 5""1, 115 and bought the small. i buy most retailer tops in xs but the small fit well - not too tight and is flattering. the colors are as seen and are a soft muted color. the material is thin which is fine for hot weather and i haven't washed so can't say how colors will hold and how well material will hold but have high expectations for retailer apparel. this will work well to wear with shorts or a navy maxi skirt. adds a nice touch of color for spring and summer.",5
"Very lovely dress!!! perfect in all ways. although i do find it to run big. i ordered the small, and i usually wear a 4 to 6 in a dress. there is a lot of fabric, but it lays nicely. it's mostly just the arm hole. it's rather large showing the strapless bra. so, deciding if i should size down, if there isn't a huge change in sizing, or keep and have altered.
if anyone has tried in both the xs and sm i will watch for comments overall size differences. i have the black and white, and wish now i wo",5
"The photo does not do this top justice. the design of this peplum is very slimming and the colors are complimentary to any skin tone. i usually wear a m (10) but purchased the l based on other reviews. it fits perfectly. 
would highly recommend!",5
"I love the feel and drape of silk. this dress has lovely drape, and fantastic color. i think if paired with the right sweater and leggings, this will work well into the fall, and also transition into other seasons if you are savvy! the only awkward point about this dress is that you must wear a belt with it if you have an hourglass shape, otherwise it's a beautiful swing fit.",5
I bought this top in pink today and it is a beautiful bright pink spring color. i did have to size down from my normal size six all the way down to a 2 due to armholes being being too big. i tend to have a chronic problems with armholes being big so not sure others may find the same problem however i typically size down to a 4 when armholes too big. plenty of room in body still but i lost some length. i do have a short torso so can get a way with this. aside from my armhole problem it is a gorge,5
Love this top! bought it in the relish color - loved it so much bought the green too! usually wear a small but the medium was perfect.,5
I love this top. fit is perfect for me. shows just the right amount of cleavage. wore it to dinner on my birthday and got a ton of compliments!,5
Have worn this top multiple times with jeans. neckline makes even those of us who are small busted look great up top!,5
"This top is all around great for summer... i've worn it to festivals, for casual workwear, etc. love the colors, they're vibrant. this top could even be worn on the warmer days of fall with a light jacket over it.",5
Just bought the patterned and gray. the small fit perfect. i do have a short torso though. chest size 32dd. i tried the medium but then the underarm portion was too wide. i might have gotten a medium petite but small petite would have been too small i think. i hope the quality holds up which was the only thing i wasn't sure of. great summer tank to throw on with jeans or shorts.,5
This flared skirt caught my attention the first time it came up in the website.  i am more a florals and lace kind of girl but the flattering shape and stripes kept me going back to it agin and again.  i finally saw it in person at my store and needed to try it on.  perfect! the colors are matte and not metallic as i thought based on the website photo.  you can definitely dress it down with a chambray too or t shirt.  i wore it to a work meeting and can't wait to wear it again.  it's a bit on th,5
"The design on the blue sweater is actually a dark navy (not black, as i thought it was), but it still looks beautiful with black underneath. rather than jeans like it's shown, the v-neck is a nice change from other cardigans i have - looks great with a cami or another v-neck underneath it. soft, nice medium-weight and not at all itchy. happy with this as an easy everyday sweater.",5
"Top is blouse and long enough to stay tucked in if you want.  like the laser cut detail front and back.  sleeveless is great for summer months here.  can wear to work or dress down with jeans.  fit is true to size.  i am 5'5"", slim and small busted so anything fits me.  i would think it you're busty it would be fine as it's a blousy fit.
the color is more of a salmon pink which works for me.  however if your looking for a true pink it may not work.",5
"I ordered this in an 8p yellow. the yellow is more of a rich golden yellow than the easter yellow i see on my monitor that i was hoping it'd be, but i'm keeping it because it fits me perfectly. i am chesty for my size (32ddd), and somehow i don't look bigger than i am in this top. i also have broad shoulders and this doesn't feel tight when i move my arms. bonus that it has loops to keep your bra straps in place! i have to dock a star though because there are quite a few fabric threads to trim f",5
"I have been eyeing this dress for months and finally, a sale. the pattern is beautiful and is a great quality. the fit:
it is a swing dress, so if you are a bigger girl, this may not be flattering; try a belt though. the high neck could be a bother for some-it does fit close to the neck, but not tight.
also, size down...two sizes. i do usually a medium and i went with a petite small.
finally, this dress can be worn in summer and winter. i do a belt and a blazer for office and a light sweater for",5
"This is a great top and worth the money. nice flow to it, soft material and light weight for hot summer days. many light weight tops are sheer and require a cami - this one does not which is key for those of us that live in hot climates. don't miss out!",5
"I love this dress and would have bought it on the spot without hesitation if i just had an event to wear it to! i am plus sized (18 pants, 16 dress, 5' 7"", 36-38 ddd) and i never size down but i was able to with this dress because it is so flowy. the dress hit just below my knee and the only fit difference i saw when i tried on the petite is that it was slightly shorter (still no thigh showing). this would be flattering on absolutely anyone! if you are worried about bulges this dress will give y",5
"This skirt is beautiful, i even have the perfect shirt to wear with it, sadly, though, i have to decide between too many nice things... what to do! i tried on the 0, and it fits me perfectly. above the knee, waist just right (26.5 in). colors are fun and great for fall, but could also summer-ize the skirt.fabric is thick, however, and well-made. i highly recommen, but leave a 0 for me!",5
"I purchased the purple motif in petite size small. it hits just the right length for me, but i can see that if i were any larger chested, it might be an issue. (for reference, i'm a 32d, 5'4, 112lb.) it's very forgiving on the tummy area, without looking bulky (other moms know what i'm talking about and understand my appreciation for this). the shirt is also a nice quality, really comfortable, and it's easy to wear with jeans, shorts, skirts, etc., making it a welcome versatile piece.",5
"I ordered the coral/peach version in size 16. it ran small, especially compared to other size 14 or 16 maeve blouses i've purchased. very tight throughout the blouse. the product photos looked so nice compared to what arrived. the material was extremely cheap in quality. it wrinkled terribly. the bow pulled the material down which obscured the look of the eyelet. the idea of this was perfect for my style. unfortunately, the poor choice in material & poor fit made this a return for me.",1
"I purchased the coral color. i'm usually between an xs and small in this brand, and i felt the top runs a tad small, so the small fit much better. simple and flattering top.",5
"I really love this top, great colors, comfortable, long enough (always a problem for me), light but feels quality fabric and nice details.",5
"This top is amazing!! i thought it looked really cute in the photos but it's even cuter online. the material is great and you can't go wrong with the fit. i love tops that are loose and flowy, so when i'm feeling a bit bloated i can still look cute in tops. this one is definitely a must!",5
"The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture- it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink, which is fine just a tad unexpected! i ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly (32ddd chest). the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine, unique touch to an otherwise basic top. i can't wait to wear it!",5
"Very true to size. i'm a sm-med or 6-8. my sizing varies widely at retailer and this was a perfect medium fit.
adorable with jeans or shorts. or dress up with suit or pencil skirt.
i have the blue/green.",5
Great shirt. i couldn't picture the material but it's washable and great for hot days when you want to look styling.,5
"I usually try to avoid paying full price for items but saw this in the store and couldn't pass it up! tried it on in my usual size, 2p, and had to have it. i bought the white/black one, and it looks great with black capris. fabric is lightweight and airy; perfect for hot summer days.",5
"If you're looking for pretty and flowy, this is it! i frequently wear xs in retailer sizing, but in this top i went with a s. 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a. love the top but debating on keeping it because i'm not sure the yellow color looks great on my slightly olive skin....great with legging capris for summer",5
"This is a great top! i love the color of the pink... it is the perfect color of pink; not too bright or too light, but a pretty pink-coral spring color! i am fair skinned and this color looks great on.
i got the 0 regular and it fits perfect. i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. i usually get petite but i can't imagine this shirt being shorter... it's a great length. i can wear it slightly tucked in or out without it looking sloppy. it also hides any belly issues for those mamas out there. love it! perfect fo",5
This is a perfect casual too to pair with jns and shorts for spring!!,5
"I bought this at my local retailer store. i bought the last one and when i walked out of the dressing room a lady asked if i was buying it..uh yeah! this is so cute with jeans or pants and booties. i bought the yellow. its lightweight and perfect for work or weekend. ive received many compliments. the arm holes were small for me, i bought a size 6, normally i'm a small or xs in most tops. i am 5-2, 130 lbs, petite and fit, the 6 regular was perfect for me, i was ok with it a little longer.",5
"Nice to have colors rather than a solid top. i actually bought the pink also because i like the fit so much. i'm 5'8"", 140 and wear a size 6, tts. i like the cut and it's long enough, which can sometimes be a problem for me.",5
"This top is beautiful and fits true to size, 4ft 11inches and 114 lbs and i purchased the xs. i was at the montclair location today and they had this top in white, lavendar, the pattern which is displayed online and gray. the white was see through so you will definitely have to wear an under garment with it. this top will be perfect for the spring with a cardigan or by itself in the summer. i still have a little stomach left over from my second pregnancy and this top hides it well. i decided to",5
"I love this tank - the colors are great and the fit is flattering. the fabric is lightweight but not cheap or so thin that you need to wear something under it. i am 5'7"" and the length was fine for me.",5
"I received tons of compliments on this dress. the print is fun and works well with the modest shape. i love the high neckline and the long hem. it's different and cool.
my only complaint: the arm holes fall super low. i didn't realize until i looked at photos but my bra was very visible.",5
"Super cute with skinny jeans. true to size. i'm size 4, 138 pounds and 34c got a small",5
"I love this sweater because it is so versatile! it looks casual with jeans, but i plan to wear it to the opera with dressy black slacks. the beautiful black embroidery is unusual and asymmetrical in back.",5
"Love this top! such a fun pattern and style. soft too! easily paired with a sweater or light weight denim/cargo jackets for fall. i generally wear an xs in retailer tops and purchased this in a 2 which is a perfect fit. it could be a tad more roomy in the chest, however the 4 would be too big overall.",5
This was the best purchase of the summer. it's cute and comfortable without being too baggy/loose. i get compliments every time i wear it. fits true to size. i bought the floral (orange) one. couldn't be happier!,5
"I bought 2 in the store.  i usually order large petite but i was in the store which doesn't have petites, so i tried a large, and it was tight in the bust, but i loved the shape.  i ended up buying xl's and taking them up at the shoulders to make it a petite fit.  gives me a small looking waistline.",5
"Great fit! for reference, i am 5'7"", 160 lbs and bought a size medium. there is a piece of fabric that acts as a cami underneath to prevent any unwanted reveal with the lace up. soft fabric and falls beautifully!",5
I bought this in blue and love it. i usually wear an xs to small in retailer shirts and a small to medium in dresses. i ended up with an extra small petite in this. it is really flattering and hides the stomach enough. i highly recommend the dress if you size way down.,5
I absolutely love this top. i thought it was going to be to big but it fits perfectly. fitted and flattering.,5
This is my favorite kind of neckline. it is very flattering & cool for summer. my only complaint is the armpit scoops down a little too low. but i will just wear a bandeau underneath it. its super cute. will be great for vacationing & next summer.,5
I love how it fits very flattering! the quality of the cotton part of this top is a little less in quality of that fabric than i expected. but i love this top and i foresee wearing it all year round!,5
This is really a nice piece. briefs have nice coverage and more of a hipster but you can also easily pair the top with just black briefs. i only sent it back because the tankini style pushed up my love handles and didn't look quite right but for many others it would work nicely.,5
"This top is adorable ,i finally broke down and bought it,so happy i did fits good,not too long sits at hip were it should (very flattering) i went with the reviews and sized up,i am a petite sx normally in retailer,but went with what the reviews said and got a reg small glad i did!it is a bit snug(not tight) in the chest,but has stretch to it , i am 5'1 108 33d (if you are bigger in the chest i would recommend a medium,) i got the purple motif (print) no see thru issues,the material is a comfortab",5
"The top is adorable, but probably better to wait for a sale as the full price is a little high for a simple top like this. i got the print one and it's very true to size.",5
I love the fit of the peplum top. it's flattering without being too full on the bottom. the print is lovely and great for summer and spring!,5
"Normally i would never try on anything with horizontal stripes.... but for some reason, i saw it in my store and gave the dress a try. fit is perfect, and dress is lined. (side note: my store had the navy dress and the stripes are horizontal and not diagonal as pictured on the model- dress looks like the ivory dress.) can be dressed up or down, so ill be a great summer go to dress. i am a curvy girl and because of the different widths of the stripes the dress works and is very flattering. i'm ve",5
My normal size m fit well but i wouldn't want it to shrink any. hangs well.,5
I absolutely love this top! i bought it in white and ended up buying it in the lavender as well. the top is very flattering and works with any occasion. the fabric is a little thin but its fine with a nude bra. i have worn the top to work and out at night and i always get lots of compliments!,5
"I am really happy with these jeans. fun fit, high waisted, great detail, and have just the right amount of stretch. i have worn them 4 times and haven't washed them yet (i find this helps shape my new jeans) and they still fit like a comfortable glove. a different twist on the ripped up jeans because of the color! love them! i normally fit a 29, ordered 28 in these and they are perfect!",5
"Absolutely fantastic top, the cut is very flattering and the colors are gorgeous in the pattern (i also bought the white).",5
"Went to the chicago michigan ave location and found this gem in the ""take a peek"" section... i think that's what it's called.  anyway... been looking for a plane white top to wear with a red lace pencil skirt and this fit the bill! wore it today with a grey midi skirt and sneakers and looks adorable!  it does flare a little and makes me feel like i'm wearing a maternity top but i don't care i love it!  went back to another retailer location and purchased the lilac one! can't wait to wear that one",5
"I ordered a size 4, my usual size in tops is s or xs for looser fitted tops, i prefer a more fitted look. for reference i am 5'4"" 120 lbs,, 32d. i ordered in pink and the color matches the online image. the pink is shear and i do have to wear a camisole underneath, which does not bother me at all. the top is adorable with jeans or slacks for work.",5
"My hips are very narrow and i don't have much of a waistline. in a-line skirts and anything that sits below the waist, i wear a size 6. skirts like this with a defined waist almost never work for me because of the waistline. if this is typically your style of skirt, i think it will run large because the waistline is more generous than usual. 

 i tried it on in the store today and bought it in a size 8. it's very comfortable and cute and will be easy to pair with different things.",5
"I really liked this top when i saw it in yellow but i was on the fence about ordering it for a while. when i did order it i chose the pink at the last second. i love it. i've worn it several times with a pair of jeans and cardigan. it travels nicely in the suitcase, no need to pull the iron out. i wear a cami underneath but it's really not that sheer so you don't need to. it's a lovely piece",5
"The print is beautiful, the fabric has a nice weight. i actually bought this because i'm early in pregnancy and wanted a dress i can wear during the transition period - because of its swing shape, this is one of those rare dresses that looks good on me now and will still look good on me in 6 months when i've got a huge belly.

fit-wise: i am 5'9, 155 lbs, 34d, and ordered a large, but i am exchanging it for a medium. the arm holes are also a bit large.",5
"Very nice quality!! awesome style, the fabrics is so soft but very durable!! this top will be great with jeans or a denim skirt!!",5
I gave this in her brighter rose colored print and love it! i get many compliments on this top! i did size up from my usual small to a medium to accommodate the girls :),5
"Made of casual materials, perfect for drinks or to be used as a vacation top. has a very flattering cut and pretty design with chiffon trim on top.",5
"I thought this shirt was really feminine and elegant. only downsides is some of the punched out holes had fabric still attached which you have cut off with scissors- otherwise the shirt will snag. and the second issue of bigger importance are the low armholes. lots of bra showing- not really sure how to get around that so i always wear it with a cardigan. but it would be nice not to have to. 
other than that it looks nice and pairs nicely with almost anything.",5
"This shirt is very flattering, which is not the case for all peplum tops. v-neck is appropriate for work. looks great with jeans or khakis. highly recommend! only con is that the material is quite thin. 5'3"" 115 lbs and xs fit perfectly.",5
Purchased this top at my local store. usually don't pay full price for clothing but had to have this top. so cute and lightweight. love that you do not need to wear a cami underneath and has material that covers your bra. usually wear a petite size due to tops being cut so low but a regular medium was perfect. suggest purchasing this top full price or if still around when it goes on sale definitely purchase. i bought the floral design.,5
"I tried this on in-store. it is super cute! i am waiting for it to go on sale because i wasn't sure it was completely worth the price. if you are in-between sizes, take the larger size.",5
"Great material, pattern and cut. perfect summer top",5
"I love this top! i ordered the print, and it will go perfectly with blue or white jeans, and even coral shorts. very flattering. i did go up a size (from xs to s) based on other reviews, and i'm glad i did. the larger size fits perfectly at the bust and falls just below the hip.",5
Fun pattern which goes with just about anything. cool for summer.  very comfortable.  fitted style but true to size.,5
"Adorable! very pleased with the quality of the fabric and the very comfortable fit. i'm sure i'll wear this with jeans, as pictured, but can also see it with a breezy summer skirt.",5
"I was nervous about buying this without trying it on, but i followed the size chart and wasn't disappointed! it's flattering thanks to the fitted upper-half and the forgiving peplum bottom-half. overall, it's thin, light, and airy.",5
"I was so excited to get this top in the mail. i loved the colors, print, cut, everything. i put it on and was so disappointed, the top looks so much better on the model. i don't know if i should have gone down a size (i go between an xs and s), but it looked terrible on me! my husband took one look at me in it and said that's being returned. still disappointed",1
I ordered my usual size 6 in tops at retailer in both the orange/blue print & the pink color. fit is tts & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. lightweight & cool for these hot days. the 'pink' really is not pink - it's a true orange so i returned this one. i didn't really need an orange top. if it had been as in the pic which is a pink/coral-like color i wld have kept it. the orange/blue print is really appealing so that is a keeper. this top is a little flowy but not tent-like which is perfect,5
"I ordered this lovely blouse the moment i saw it, and i am very pleased that it is the quality and fit i'd hoped for. i bought the medium in pink. i am 130#, 34f, size 8 or medium on most tops. the medium fits me perfectly; i love the gathering at top back so that there is no pulling at all across the back or bust. i am mystified that all blouses aren't designed with a nice level of gathering to accommodate a bust and to give a flattering flow.. i am busty so awkward tightness can be a problem o",5
"Love the fabric, print, and cut! it's a smidge low in the neckline, but that's probably because i'm busty. nice and breezy for our blazing hot and humid florida summers.",5
"This dress references that it is off the shoulder in the description. but i did not find it to be so; it fits me as pictured on the model - sort of a ballet neck or wide scoop neck. in any case, the fabric is as pictured. and - it's lined! yay - not see through. the varying sizes of stripes give it interest despite the neutral colors. it is cute with a denim jacket and is really comfortable.",5
"I was looking for a flowier top to wear under cardigans, and this is pretty perfect. it is more sheer than i would like, but because i am wearing it as a bottom layer, i'll overlook that. the fit is great and the peplum is a cute detail to make this layering piece a little different.",5
"Love this top - on sale, i bought two of this color, a grey and the green, i never buy more than one of anything unless i absolutely love it ! complimentary to the body, and the colors are beautiful. i'm 5'2"" there were no pxs so i opted for xs, perfect... thanks retailer ??",5
Love the design (i got the blue and green one). it was more see-through than i thought but the pattern covers it so it doesn't matter what color bra you wear.,5
This dress is amazing! the photos do not do it justice! runs a tad large - definitely can size down.,5
"Unique, sophisticated and versatile summer dress that you will fall in love with. dress it up with heels for a night at the gallery or dress is down with a denim jacket for an easy day look. it needs no accessories. this silk dress is soft and it lays beautifully. you will want to wear it all summer long. fits tts. love it!",5
"This shirt is purportedly made of silk, but it is extremely low quality. the material is coarse and scratchy. it's not even worth it at the extra 40% off sale price. returned.",1
This is my favorite purchase so far! i am in love with this jumpsuit. it it fitted on top and has a flowy dress feel on the bottom. i got this on sale recently and if you can grab it do it! you won't be disappointed.,5
"This vest is adorable! i love the color, it goes well with almost anything. the drawstrings work great, some days i cinch them a little tighter for a more fitted look. honestly, i wear it at least once a week - out with friends or even to my job as a nanny. i was a little worried about the length of it because i'm tall, but it works perfectly with my build.",5
Super soft flannel material. the colors are beautiful and perfect for fall! it's doesn't ride up the shoulders but stays in place off-the-shoulder style. i love it!,5
"Love this top.  i get compliments every time i wear it.  got the medium. fits perfect. 5'4"", 138#.  even at my age it looks great.",5
The perfect dress for dinner date or summer weddings. or traveling. love this dress. not sure on washing yet since it is a silk dress. extremely comfortably and beautiful. i can't recall the last time i bought a new dress.,5
"This shirt was tent like on me and there was really no way around it. i am fairly small- usually a 4 or 6 in tops, and smaller on top- barely 34b. this top was incredibly unflattering, falling to cut right at my hips and sitting open and way too flowy-- like a pillowcase/sacklike fit. there was just too much fabric here to make it work for me. it's unfortunate because it looks adorable in the product photo and i love the plaid mix with the open shoulders- a nice transition to fall. unfortunately",1
"I liked this dress but wasn't sure about the color on me. i tried it on anyway. originally, i tried on the 0, but it seemed big so i ordered the 00. also usually i order petite, but this dress is already short (and i am not getting younger), so i went with regular size this time. color was not bad on my pale skin, i think the hue was ok (surprisingly). one thing that might bug the perfectionist in me, the zig zag isn't always aligned, the waist, for instance was crooked, but if it is like that e",5
"This dress makes my heart skip a beat. it's beautiful, soft and colorful. it's a lovely midi length which can be tricky for 5'5"" lil ole me but it's perfect. it has slits up the side for an easy breezy look. the fabric is so silky & pretty form fitting if you buy the right size. i'm a solid 4. have bought heaps of dresses from retailer and i can't stop, won't stop.",5
"I am in love with this top. flannel shirts are a fall staple, but i don't own any. any flannel shirt that i have come across has been a button down, which simply does not work for me, given my chest size. i hate button downs that gap or that i have to leave unbuttoned and wear a tank underneath. it's not flattering. this top is flannel, no buttons, and off the shoulder, which is such a unique and fresh style. the off the shoulder feature stays in place thanks to tiny straps sewn in that you put",5
"Comfortable, great fit and beautiful colors. the interesting thing is that in this picture, it shows the dress just below the knee. i am 5'5"" so totally average height, but the dress falls just above my ankles., which i personally think is way more attractive. not sure if there are two versions of this dress, but be careful if you buy online. i got mine in the glendale store.",5
"What a great, soft piece for fall.  the top is flattering and comfy at the same time. it looks really romantic with the bare shoulder look.",5
"I live in hawaii and always looking for a comfortable light and breezy dresses, this was perfect. the colors are gorgeous, the fit is true to size and it is extremely comfortable. dress it up or dress it down with a denim jacket and you will be definitely love it. i am thrilled i made the purchase!!",5
I absolutely love this sweater....it is perfect for fall,5
Great shirt. very soft and comfortable. the elastic on top to keep it off shoulders is not too tight--just tight enough. the colors are pretty. it's give a rustic city vibe. love!,5
"Love! received so many compliments! it can be dressed up or down and is so comfortable.  i did order a l  based on the reviews, but found it to be big.  i would've returned for a m, but it was sold out and i didn't want to risk not having it at all so i kept.",5
"Hadn't really looked at this dress till i saw it in person in the store. so i tried it on. i'm only 5'1 and 140 lb. busty on top so i tried the 8. it was a smidge snug, decided since the dress has no give to go with a 10. would have liked this in a petite for the shorter length, but it's back ordered till august and i really wanted to take it with me on vacation. its just above my ankles in regular length, which will work and i can up the score with some wedges. this dress fits like a dream and",5
"I do not have a waist that goes ""in"". i either have to wear shift dresses that are cut slim, or find ""fit and flare"" pieces that create a waist for me. this is the latter. it's really cute, different and flattering. it has a nice mix of graphic sophistication with a somewhat romantic silhouette. it is gauzy with ruffles and tiers. the off-white slip underneath is great for a couple reasons: it provides a nice underlayer that is just visible underneath the ""turtleneck"" top, cutting the school-mar",5
"I purchased this vest in the store. the colors vary depending on where it is sewn - i purchased one with black around the middle, and more black around the collar (it was more flattering). the fit and design are lovely. it's fuzzy, but since i don't have any 'fur' in my wardrobe, this is a nice ease into that part of fashion for me. i highly recommend it, even for the price.",5
"The burgundy plaid colors are what caught my eye! so perfect for the fall season. i usually do not like off the shoulder tops as most do not stay down but this one does and as others have stated there are arm stays inside to help with that. i stayed with my usual small to keep the length and it was fine. got compliments the first time i wore it. so glad they restocked in my size, as they had been sold out.",5
"I have another sanctuary vest similar to this one and decided i needed to snag this one in the moss green. it's so pretty and it's extremely versatile. i'm 8 months pregnant and it's been a fun vest to wear over a tank with a necklace. i can see this piece working for all seasons. if the other color would have been available, i would have grabbed it, especially at the sale price. you can't beat it! the only downside to this vest is that compared to my other medium sanctuary vest, this one is a b",5
"Love this top. i'm athletic, it's a little tight around the arms. but it's a really nice looking blouse off and on!",5
Off the shoulder is everywhere and this is a great shirt for the fall.,5
"I saw this vest at my local retailer store over the weekend and decided to try it on. i am typically an xs at retailer and the xs fit perfectly. i can't wait to wear this during the spring and summer. it's really lightweight and soft which i love. i purchased the copper color, and would consider the color in the photo to be very true. this was definitely a splurge, but i am overall very happy with my purchase. i highly recommend it!",5
This jumpsuit is great dressed up or down. the only issue i had with it is that the straps are very long (but that was an easy fix).,5
The shoulder bearing aspect makes this top sexy yet it doesn't look like you're trying too hard. sleeves can be worn up or down and everything stayed in place either way. i get tons of compliments each time i wear this.,5
"I'm currently on the prowl for the other colors of this fantastic sweater dress/tunic. i own the lavender in size m and it fits perfectly on me (5'3"" 36dd) without enhancing what i want to hide. great for winter",5
"The simple shape of this silky & comfortable shift is transported by the fun psychedelic pattern. the fabric is lightweight and drapes very nicely because of the lining. i purchased the size 10 petite to accommodate my 36dd bust/wide rib cage and it fits perfectly. the high neck is fastened with a single hook. versatile and comfortable and a clear winner for spring and summer. for sizing reference my other stats are 5'3"" tall, 140#, m/l on top, s/m on bottom.",5
"I decided to try this dress on based on the other reviewer's positive words, and i wasn't disappointed! it's so cute and stylish. i plan to wear with black boots. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, wear a 2 or 4, and i got a 4. one thing - at the waist, the pattern breaks a bit and doesn't match perfectly. i tried on a second dress and liked its pattern more than i did that of the first i tried.",5
This is a super cute jumpsuit that is also super comfortable. the only thing i wish was different on this jumpsuit is that the pants would go all the way to the ground. but it is still super cute and a keeper !,5
I returned this item. it was soft. very blah fabric. nothing special.,1
"This dress is everything i hoped it would be: flattering, cute, cozy",5
"Great buy. i bought the cream jumpsuit.  i'm small on bottom and larger on top. this was perfect, shouldn't fit tight, should flow, has lots of room, it is linen, adjustable buttons on front and adjustable on the back of jumpsuit. legs are wide and flowy. casual but classy. both sides have about 3 buttons at hips. great addition to any closet. unique in its own right.",5
This dress fits beautifully. it is warm and comfortable. winter's gem.,5
"I bought this top in a small and it was true to size. loved that it wasn't too fitted across the back, but was still able to show a bit of body with the drawstring by the waist. it will become a wardrobe staple during the hot months in dallas.",5
I've been looking for a new winter dress and this one fit the order! it's warm yet flattering and i love the color.,5
"I'm in love with this top! looks just like it does in the photos, except the colors are maybe a little more vibrant. it's definitely boxy, so you may not like it if boxy isn't your thing, but i think the pattern placement really works with the boxy shape. i usually wear a small in tops and the xs/s fits great. it's also machine wash and tumble dry which is a plus (although i haven't washed it yet). unique, chic, and effortless...order before it's gone!",5
"I bought this dress in-store, and it's fantastic. i'm between a medium and a large, and i bought a large because it was the one available, and it's fantastic. some of the polyester is fraying between the seams, which is obviously not ideal, but i'm willing to overlook that for generally how great this dress is.",5
This top is true to size and fits perfectly.  color is very natural.,5
"Cute style, cute color, cute cut.  and i got it on sale!",5
"Bought on a whim, on sale.  i am a small in 95% retailer but got these in m for comfy casual looseness--perfect.  i am 5'8"", and these hit the top of my feet--perfect.  fabric is substantial but not heavy--perfect for cool so. cal evenings.   color is rich denimy blue--beautiful.  buttons are pretty. i have nothing negative to say about these aside from their price (even on sale).  oh, and the knot.  as i sit on my squishy leather sofa, i feel the knot in my back.  hmmm.  oh well.  still love them",5
"My friend and i both bought this in the ""white"" color in our usual sizes. the fabric is soft, the neckline is flattering and the drawstring is cute. hides a tummy beautifully. the store had the white and the green. the green color looks very different in person than it does online. in person, it is darker and more of a soft emerald green--not the pale green-gray pictured online.",5
"I bought this to give room for an expanding tummy - i'm 6 months pregnant and this completely conceals the bulge.  i suspect i will appreciate that in the spring when i'm actually trying to hide my leftover belly... it's incredibly soft and the top is wide enough to cover a bra strap.  the arm holes are small enough to cover my parts but large enough to be comfy.  i'm 5'5"", medium build and normally wear a medium but got a large given my circumstances.  a medium would have probably worked normal",5
"I tried this on in the store in size xs regular in green and i was happy to see it covered my bra everywhere. but it was a little too long (i usually wear xspetite). so i ordered it in the bright red hoping it would be less orange than shown, which it was, but it was more pink and kind of hard to describe; maybe more salmon or coral... i went up from my usual size to spetite for fear that the armholes would've been too tight on xsp but they probably would've been fine and the spetite is a little",5
"Love this vest. fits very similar to the pilcro denim jacket. the fabric is softer, and not too heavy. the wash on mine is pretty close to the one in the picture, maybe half a shade darker. can see myself wearing this with summer maxi dresses, skirts, and pants, a very versatile piece that will go into fall. i usually take a 0/2 and the xs fit perfectly.",5
"I received this top in white, last fri., and have already worn it twice. it is the perfect top for hot weather because it doesn't cling to the body. the top layer is flowy and breathable. i plan on buying the blue one next to get me through the warm weather months.",5
"So this is actually a holding horses dress, its mislabeled on the website. tts, a stunning vintage inspired piece, very 40's but timeless. the keyhole isn't too low cut, this is appropriate for work. beautiful drape and great lining - this dress can twirl! i am usually a xsmall/small and went with the small, fits perfectly though a bit loose in the waist but still very flattering - the xsmall would have been too tight in the shoulders. lovely dress!",5
"This is such a flattering top. i bought it in green. the green is a cooler version of kelly green, not the muted green i see on my computer screen. i'm fair complected and that color looks great on me. i love the elastic at the waistband, which helps camouflage my mom belly. i wish they made more tops with blousy, elastic waists! i bought several new tops this summer and this is probably my favorite. after wearing it for a couple of weeks, i decided to remove the tie string, which hangs low; it",5
"I didn't think much of this tank while perusing sale items on the website. but after reading the reviews i decided to order it. and it did not disappoint. i ordered the green, which is more vibrant in-person than on the website. and i wore it the next day, which is always a good sign. i loved it so much i quickly ordered the white too. it is flattering, stylish and comfortable - an excellent combination! i highly recommend this tank as a summer staple. it goes with everything.",5
"Grabbed this tank on sale today in the green color. great tank. it is not thin like some other retailer tops. it actually is a double knit fabric which hides those imperfections we don't want anyone to see or worry about. 
the top runs a bit on the full side, so if you are in between sizes, i would go down one. this top is great to wear under any open sweater for the entire fall season. the green color is a jewel green so the top does not look summary at all.
it is extremely comfortable a",5
"I felt like i was taking a risk by ordering these without trying them on, but i am so happy i did. they are soft and solid without being thick or stiff. incredibly comfortable. i have a larger hip and booty and these fit great. no grabbing at all and without making the top too big or loose.",5
I love this top! it's perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer. it's material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer. it's a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then i'd size down one size from your normal. i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly. i'm tempted to buy this in more colors.,5
"I love this top! i have all 4 colors in size large. i'm 5'9 170 lbs with a large bust. it's a loose fit that is very flattering. do not dry i wash in cold water and hang dry. first one i bought i dried and it shrunk quick a bit. if you are tall, size up.",5
"This top is flowy, fluid and comfortable. the material is like a stretchy crepe. it's thin, but not sheer. well, i bought the bright red (maybe white is sheer?). oh, speaking of bright red, well it is! i mean, it is the most vibrant red. the photo on-line (at least on my screen) doesn't really do the red justice at all.

the fit is true to size. the nice thing about this top is that it has movement and yet it isn't full of fabric and look like a maternity top. and, the armholes are not big. th",5
"I have been shopping at retailer for years and this is my first review - that is how much i love this dress!
it is so incredibly comfortable. it is like wearing a cozy blanket. you guys, it twirls. :) i never received as many compliments on an outfit as i do when i wear this dress. (i bought the orange one). i am plus size and i don't wear a whole lot of knee length dresses. dresses in general are hard to find because they don't fit right so i was thrilled to find this. i am also thrilled that it",5
Found this little surprise in store yesterday where thankfully one of my atlanta stores carries petites. the materials is wonderful - feels like cashmere. i got the rust which will be an anytime-anywhere piece!. recommend highly.,5
"This tank top is comfortable and very cute. it hides my tummy, as well, which is a bonus! ordered in another color i love it so much",5
"I purchased a size small. i usually always buy a petite. but this fit me just fine since it is a vest. the length in the back didn't fall too long. it runs true to size. it's soft and i wear it with long dresses, rompers, short dresses, skirts. it's a nice tapered vest. i'm 34d and it's fine.",5
"I have been on the fence about this blouse until i went into the store and tried it on. instant love for me.
the fabric is not sheer.....yeah! the shoulders are cut in, so you may need a halter bra. i typically go between a 4 or 6, but found the cut at a a line so there is a nice flow, but not overly so, so purchased the 4. the colors will go with anything, for many seasons. love the quality.",5
"I had the pleasure of trying this on today and looooooove it. i love all things bows, but usually they are off-centered over the left shoulder. i have a bit of an ocd thing, and i prefer things to be over my right shoulder so usually while i love them, i can't wear them. i love that this bow is in the middle-and i like that it is higher than the neckline of the shirt so you know there is some skin underneath. it adds to the sexiness of the blouse while also creating a more pleasing look. i feel",5
"I love this jacket. it is stylish, yet has the softness of you favorite lounge wear. the faux fur gives it a touch of holiday fun, and, the fitted cut flatters your shape.",5
"I bought this top as it is perfect for work under a blazer! the patten is pretty and eye catching, i love that it's 100% silk and has the tie in front so it's not too low for work. so chic and sophisticated!",5
I am very petite and ordered the xs. it is too big which is often the case. i gauge how much i like something by my willingness to spend even more money on alterations. i love this jacket so much that i am willing to go through that extra step. i love winter and this is a perfect winter top. the faux fur is very soft and cozy and has a rich look to it. i have yet to have it altered which is the only reason for my 4 stars under quality. i don't yet know how it will fit once complete. the fact tha,5
"This top isn't straight as it would seem on the ""tucked-in"" picture on the model. colros are really rpetty and neutral in eprson. fabric si very soft. i tried on the 0 but am wondering about trying on 00 or petite size...which i would have to order, so will wait a bit on this one.",5
I purchased this jacket as a gift for my daughter for christmas. i thought it would look nice on her and i love retailer. she was very surprised and loved it. she wore the jacket the next day and it looked lovely on her. a very unique and beautiful addition to her wardrobe.,5
"I coveted this blouse for weeks and finally pressed go during the recent sale. it is truly lovely - the textured silk and its lining combine to give this blouse the weight it needs to flow perfectly when untucked. it is a-shaped and fuller at the hem. when tucked, it is neat as a pin. the colors are almost metallic and it looks as if the flowers have been painted on. this is an elegant casual look with white jeans and heels, or i've dressed it up with a black pencil as well as a skirt almost ide",5
"Gorgeous colors, great neckline (can be worn off one shoulder), the slits on the side allow for wear as tunic or as half tucked. very cute.",5
"I tried this on a whim last week even though it was a bit above my budget, and i couldn't resist taking it home. the photo doesn't do the textured sheen of the silk justice--the metallic tones of the flowers are really vibrant, but still subtle. my husband (who usually hates anything with a bow) loves this, though i have been tying the bow a bit lower than shown on the model. go one size down--i usually wear a 14 in blouses but took a 12 in this.",5
Adorable soft top for the fall! i wanted to love it because of the colors and the fact that it is so retro! it was just way too big for me. i'm always a medium but in this i probably should have sized down. i still gave it 5 stars because it is so cute--just didn't fit me! sadly i will be returning this!,5
I was eyeing this sweatshirt but didn't want to pay full price- i got it on sale and am so happy i did! it is super soft and comfy. it also fits perfectly- not too baggy but also not form fitting. as a moz fan i couldn't pass it up. awesome sweatshirt!,5
"This is the cutest romper ever !! very high quality.. 
it has always been a challenge for me to find and love rompers. but this fit beautifully.
i cant wait to wear it this summer.",5
"This sweater was far better than expected. very soft, and flattering. it's light to wear, but keeps me cozy in my freezing office. looks super cute with jeans and boots.",5
"Perfect semi-dressy summer top, that could definitely go year round. love the buttons up the back. it's flows but the slight peplum keeps it from looking tent like. love this so much i ordered another in black.",5
I love this top. i found it to be true to size. i usually wear a size large or extra large and the size large fit well. i really appreciate that the armholes are not gigantic and don't show underthings. i bought the navy/black and find that a navy cami works well under it. i like this with casual pants and jeans under an open front sweater for now and think it will be nice with a linen skirt or shorts in warmer weather. this is not a style i would usually wear but i found the two tone lace very,5
The picture doesn't do this justice. this top is amazing in person. i purchased my regular size 2. it is very versatile and the colors are perfect as well as cut and material. worth the money,5
"This is a gorgeous blouse!  the quality is exceptional- beautiful, soft silk. the pattern is lovely, the shape and design is spot on!!  finally!  a lovely tie neck blouse that fits well and is made well. i'm a busty mama and my the size 2 fits perfectly. thank you retailerpolgie for a gorgeous piece of clothing!",5
This top is so cute.  i love it and get tons of compliments on it.,5
This shirt is so cute with skinny jeans and crossbody bag! i am 34b so i did not have the issue with the cut of top at the bustline. love it!,5
"I love this top. the seam does go across the bustling but if you are small chested like me...it is perfect. very bohemian and an almost classic look with a very contemporary twist. there are splits up the side that show off a great pair of leggings. i wore this today with some lysee black and grey patterned leggings, a long grey camisole, and some cute short free people booties...i may have gotten 20 compliments. love it.",5
"The fabric is so soft and completely lined; the straps are adjustable.
this is the best summer dress ever!!! so comfortable and easy to just throw on. goes with a multitude of colors for your sandals and bags. i love this dress!
i'm 5' 7"", 137 lbs., and ordered a size medium, with plenty of room around the bust; no worry about arm holes being too big because you adjust the straps to suit your body. i love the below the knee length. i like comfy but you could easily size down.
nice embroidery",5
Ii loved the idea of this summer top flowing in the breeze... then i got it and the selves did nit give as much slack as i would have hoped #spandex so #returned!,1
"I've been looking for a great long, loose, versatile vest for some time, and this is just about perfect. it's slightly heavier than i would have preferred (i'm in a warm climate), but it excels in every other way. it looks so much better on than it does on the hanger, and can be dressed up or down. definitely a steal on sale!",5
"The colors are amazing. so vibrant and plentiful. the arm holes are fairly generous but not bad. i think it just adds to the loose fitting nature of the dress. i got a medium.. i'm 170 with a small chest. medium is my norm for maeve. the buttons in the back are difficult, you need help getting on, but getting off you can do solo. this dress makes your shoulders look really good!! it sits in a very flattering way.",5
"Wow. i just love this dress. it hangs beautifully and is such a great length. shoulder straps adjustable, simple button closures in back. i wore it dressed up a bit with a sweater and then again more causal without. i got it on sale so it fit even better!! :)",5
"This vest is so cute and flattering. these pictures don't do it justice. you must see it in person and try it on. it only has a small percentage of wool in it, so it could easily be worn in the spring/summer with a tank.",5
"This vest is awesome - the photo does not do it justice. you can dress it up or dress it down. great materials used. does run big, so select one size down!",5
This dress is very well made. the fabric is thick enough for winter weather and is great for work or a nice party. i do not think the arm openings are too large at all.,5
Love the movement of the blouse and how it falls. great quality material.,1
"This is a great light, free flowing top for the summer. i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area, but if you are small busted, you won't be affected. it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer!",5
"Bought this shirt on a whim, and it surpassed my expectations. just enough business, just enough pleasure. i wore it with high waisted skinnies and wedges and stopped counting the compliments! excited to try it in other ways. it's summery in print, but fall ish in color, so i think i can get even more use out of it in the next few months.",5
"This blouse is a beauty! i love the hemline across the bust and all the flowy fabric that drapes in front and in back. i love the long length and the side slits. the wide hemline at the bottom is lovely. the cotton is soft and light and as amazing to wear as it is to look at. it makes me feel beautiful just having it on. be aware the fabric is sheer and requires a tank, but i don't mind as it is both pretty and comfortable. i sized up, which fits how i like. i never tried it on in my normal size",5
"I had been eyeing this top online, decided to hit my local retailer to try it on! it is an adorable spring tunic!
i think it runs a size larger then your usual size. for reference, i am 5'7"" and 139 pds, small busted, and i bought a size 6, fits perfect. i will machine wash and hang to dry. happy with my purchase!",5
"Not sure why some people did not like the fit. i am a ""d"" and yes the seam sits along bust, but not in a weird way. love this shirt, its adorable.",5
"I love this top it is cute with shorts, capris and jeans. it's really comfortable but looks put together and stylish.  great for running errands to drinks with the girls. a good transition piece into fall with a light cardigan.",5
"My favorite white blouse ever.
i was hesitant, but really love it. it makes me think of summer, flowers, paris.... it's so soft and comfortable. yes, the cut is different and took a moment to get used to... but i like that. and it looks better on. imo. i can see this getting worn a lot on hot summer southern days. i've been on a hunt for a great white blouse for a long time. tres chic!",5
This is a must have! way cuter in person. love the look and feel. it runs large so size down. it's more cream than white,5
"Saw this in the store and had to have it after i tried it on. it's shape is unique, it's very ""floaty"" and looks awesome with skinny cropped jeans & chunky sandals. 
the ""empire"" does hit across the breast line, not below. i thought it added to the different shape, & didn't look odd on me. i am 5'6"" so it might overwhelm a petite frame.",5
I wanted to add my two cents because i was worried when ordering the pants from previous reviews that they would be to tight as it had been suggested they run small. i didn't find that to be the case and think they run true to size,5
Love this top! tried it on in the store & loved it more. it's a great transitional piece with rich colors. the top is sheer so will need to layer with a camisole. haven't worn yet so can't speak to how well it will wash.,5
"Probably not for everyone but boy do i love it and i've gotten loads of compliments on it! looks best with skinny jeans, would be good with leggings also.

i am 5'7"", 155# and bought a size 10, fits perfectly!",5
I saw this dress in store. at first i was not impressed because it was shapeless on but i added a belt and it was so much better. i styled it with my leather wrap around ada belt. looks great with a jean jacket or a leather jacket to make it look more chic.,5
"I didn't notice this dress online but it jumped out at me at the store.  i sized down to a small as the bust and arm area seemed very loose in  medium.  (36b). it's very comfy and beautiful.  i tried it with  a belt,  but quite honestly  it doesn't need one and it looks so much nicer without one.  not sure about what bra to wear ...likely strapless , or as one person said. .none.",5
"The fabric of the pants is a great thickness so the pants have a very nice look. the fabric is smooth, not jean material. for me this is nice because though they have weight to them, the pants are not hot and can be used to dress up or down, much more versatile than jeans. these pants are very fitted through the hips but then fall very nicely. i am not a big fan of capri length yet i really love these! i have already enjoyed wearing these out and they look fabulous with any type of wedge or heel",5
"This may be one of the cutest items that i have every owned! runs big, i am a 4 and the 0 fits perfectly.",5
"These photos do not do the vest any justice. i randomly saw this in the sale section at my local retailer. tried it on and it was super cute, but i did the whole ""walk away, maybe you'll forget about it"" thing. that did not happen. i ran back to retailer on my lunch break the next day, and thank goodness, there was still one left in my size. it actually drapes in a flattering way, and it looks polished. it's so versatile. i would not have looked for this vest based on these photos, but i'm telling y",5
"I had 3 shirts from clearance in my hand but put them back to get this shirt. it's perfect! great with skinnies/sandals for the spring, or boots/leggings for the fall. great for layering and so versatile...i will get more wear out of this than my 3 clearance shirts combined. i like the slit in the side, it makes flowy while also preventing it from looking like a maternity shirt. the only thing i would like is if the shirt was a little less see-through. it's not bad, but i will definitely have to",5
"I love everything about this dress! i love the colors - style and fit. it is so comfortable. i had so many people ask where i got it. 
i usually wear an xs or s in retailerpolgy dresses and i got this in an xs and it was perfect.",5
"I love how boho, colorful and comfy this dress is. sometimes you just want to wear your comfiest bra and not worry about a dress that doesn't cover the straps. they were out of the petite small so i went with the small. i am 5' 125 lbs, and it fits perfectly, just more of a midi length. no problemo!",5
"Fit is boxy yet flattering and material is sheer but not overly delicate. took my usual size four, i am moderately short waisted.",5
"I saw this dress and had to have it. it is very cute and comfortable. i have fuller hips, so i'm not sure about the stripe across the widest section of my body. the arm holes are a little gaping as well as other reviewers have mentioned. i bought the medium which fits well everywhere, but the arm holes. i think the small would fit me everywhere, but the hips. so, i'm on the fence of whether to keep it. i do like the dress and it is of good quality; it just may not be the right fit for me. i'm a",5
"Beautiful dress, i like the length and cut. nice material. runs a bit big. i think it'll look nice with a belt. great colors.",5
"I saw this blouse referenced online a few times and have a weakness for white blouses, so off i went to my local retailer. this blouse turned out to be delightful! my thoughts: i would say it fits true to size, as a 0 fits me perfectly in the shoulders. it is a flowy tunic blouse that has a high skit, so it's not possible to wear this as a dress (it is very sheer too). i do think this blouse is designed for the line to hit below the bust, so my incredibly flat chest works in this. if you have even",5
"I got lots of compliments on this dress as expected. the arm holes are a little large, meaning low. but other than that i love it.",5
"I'm taking this to hawaii for the holidays, i'm wearing it with black calf length tights and a black belt. it is fine without tights, i just like that look. it is a really great dress.",5
"The details on these capris are adorable - the stitching and side ribbon detail, the fit, weight of the fabric, everything is fantastic. i got the taupe and moss green because i couldn't decide. i wish they came in more colors. fit, for me, was true to size, i usually wear a 2 to a 4 (size 26 to 27 in denim) and got the 2 because i wanted them to be more fitted. they stretched a bit after wear, but not so much that they were too baggy. i will live in these, this summer. if you want a more fitted",5
"I love love love this top! so flattering and comfortable- looks great with jeans, leggings, or i totally plan to use it as a beach cover-up as well. they only had medium left (i usually get xs/s) but it was still as flattering and i usually like my clothes on the roomy side!",5
"Yes it is boxy, but by design. because it is a shorter length and sheer it isn't an issue for me even as a petite. it has a bit of an ethereal look on as if it's just floating on your body. what doesn't show well in online pictures are beautiful chartreuse, charcoal & white threads running throughout the design. this adds to the classy look of this top.
great to dress up jeans or with a dressy pencil skirt for a night out.",5
"If i could wear this top every single day, i would. this is the white flowy top i've been dreaming of; but better! the fabric is so lightweight and breathable. i can wear this on a cool spring night with a scarf, skinny jeans & ankle boots, or on a hot summer day with shorts/skinnies and sandals. you can dress it up or down. be aware that the chest hem is at a non-traditional height; not quite above or below the breasts. however, i think it looks flattering on both small-chested and busty women.",5
I have three pairs of these in different colors (one pair is striped) and i love them. they are flattering and comfy. they go with nearly everything. can't get enough!!!!!,5
"Very unique, beautiful piece.  drapes well, accentuates curves in a classy way.  this is an eye catcher.  definitely.",5
This vest is great. i'm wearing with my red striped turtleneck dress i got on sale here. i can see this going with so many outfits. mainly those dresses that might feel a little tight around butt and hip area- this will cover it all. worth full price imo. tts. i'm a 10 and this in m is perfect.,5
"I ordered this online in a sz 4, perfect fit and very comfortable. the side slits make it even more interesting since jeans or leggings will show!",5
"This dress pops! gorgeous colors and simple, classic flowy design. i thought it ran a little big, i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow. 34b for reference.",5
"This top is so soft and with a henley neck opening and longer ribbed shirttail hems, it not only feels heavenly against the skin but it gives off a casual chic vibe. it is also great for layering under shorter sweaters and sweatshirts to give my staples a little oomph. it is a bit sheer so cami is a must. i am also not sure how well it will hold up after washings, especially since it's priced quite high. i love it so much that i will most probably end up keeping it it is true to size. i ordered",5
"I bought this as a ""reward."" i have wanted a leather jacket forever and i truly love this. goes with so many things; tons of compliments. soft, comfortable material.",5
I agree that the color in the picture online is lighter but i bought it from the store and really like that it isn't just another off-white sweater. it fits true to size and i love the quality. it is really beautiful!,5
I bought this to go with the pants they had online & i love them together. the sweater seems thin for the price but i still love it.,5
"I absolutely love this dress. the color is beautiful and saturated, the fit is spot-on and so flattering. i ordered my usual size 10 - for reference i am 5'9"", 170# 34f bra and 40-41"" hips. i love this brand!",5
"I love this dress ! my husband loves this dress on me !
i ordered on line, it did not come in my usual 4, and it was only in petite. i ordered the 0petite. it fits fine, a little shorter than expected, but i am 5'2"" so it is fine.
very well made and lined.",5
"Saw this online when it first came up and thought it looked lovely. i purchased a different pleated dress and decided i didn't need a second pleated dress. was at my local retailer and they had one pink dress in a size 4 and a blue in a 0. decided to try them both on. the zero actually fit perfectly and at the sale price i had to have it. the material is beautiful, little details like the ruffled hem are lovely. one i will wear for years. thinking about getting the link but the blue is lovely. i'm",5
"I was very hesitant about this. i read the previous reviews and thought oh no. the first time i saw it in person i was mildly disappointed because the material wasn't how i thought it would be. then i saw it up close, and i realized it was better than i thought. however, i didn't have time to try it on.

it wasn't until later when i saw it on someone else that i realized i was looking at a must have. i am so happy i purchased this. its beautiful and flattering and the colors are bright yet und",5
This is a wonderful vest! i love the lining!! keeps you nice and warm! i love the muted green color! the pockets are sewn closed but can be cut open at the stitching without ruining the vest!!,5
I love this shirt but it was huge! i ordered a small and i was drowning in it. unfortunately i had to return it.,5
"I loved this dressy ruffle sweatshirt. i am long waisted and these often look too short on me but this one fit perfect and actually accentuated my curves in a good way as opposed to making me look ""puffy!""",5
"I wanted to love this sweater but it is a return. it is a very weird fit, very thick, rug-like material and unfitted. the shoulders are bulky, the top is big and the booty is small. i am 5'2"", 34c and typically wear a small. the arms were very long, way too long. i will say other than that the top was true to size, may look okay on someone who had a larger chest and a smaller bum!",1
This is a real cute vest that is also soft and comfy to wear. love it!,5
"I found this skirt beautiful for year round wearing.  it's lined and tts.  i usually wear a size 4 and this fit well.  some might say it runs big but i like skirts to sit a bit lower on my waist and this gave me a good 2 inches in length.  i'm 5'3"" and 119# and it hit me just above the knee.  i paired it with the back tie embroidered top by akemi & kin because the blue of the embroidery in the shirt was beautiful with the blue in the skirt.  it will also go with a cropped creme turtleneck i have",5
"I love this dress. the length is great and the dress just feels great. the material is raw silk (which i love) and the sizing does run a tad large, but with the make of the dress. i can lose weight and still wear the dress. well made and the buttons in back are super cute.",5
"Love trying things outside my usual style, thought this might look like a sack but fell in love! looks effortless, easy to accessorize, dress up or down & comfortable. keeper! want to try it with platform sneaks for casual look.",5
"Bought this in pink for a wedding this summer. the dress detail is noted as a ""swing silhouette"" & should be perfect for twirling on the dance floor. the bit of orange under layer peaking out from underneath is just the right amount of contrast to the bright pink. a pair of heels will make this dress look perfect!",5
"This vest is super cute! i'm 5'5"" 120 and usually wear an xs at retailer, i have this in a small and it fits perfectly, fits snug when zipped, my usual xs would have definitely been too tight. would definitely recommend!",5
This vest is super cute on. it definitely has kept me warm this winter.,5
"Completely oversized top, size medium was swimming on me.....boxy, baggy, shapeless -- what more can i say? even in an xs this would not have fit in any way like the photo, returned.",1
This sweater is a dull off white color. it looks old fashioned. don't get.,1
"I purchased this jacket in a pxs, as i am 5'2"" and 110lbs. the sleeve length is perfect! the fabric is soft and lightweight, which is perfect for living in southern california. i don't feel any itchiness either. the rest of the jacket fits me perfectly and hits right at the top of my hips. 


there are two cute grommets on each side at the bottom by the hem, which add nicely to the look. i like how the sleeves are ribbed, giving it a comfy sweater feel. there's also two zippered pockets, whic",5

"I ordered this shirt and was happy to see that it looks just like it does online -- i love the rusty orange and pale blue contrast with the navy. the navy blue underlayer is so flattering, and the sheer sleeves are feminine and lovely. the shape and pattern are forgiving. this brand is really hitting it out of the park these days. this blouse runs a bit smaller than some meadow rue. if you're between sizes (especially arm-wise), i'd order up. otherwise just get your regular size. the body is flo",5
"Love this sweater so much that i got it in both colors. got the size small, fits well and keeps me warm. the cream color is very functional. the blue color is beautiful and unique.",5
"Gave this to a friend as a gift.  soft, lovely.  she loves it.",5
I love this shirt. the colors are just as depicted. the material is gorgeous and the top is very flattering. fits true to size for retailer small (i'm normally a medium outside of this store).,5
"These are horrible pants!!! they run small in the thigh and butt like other cartonnier crops. look great at first....after a few hours of wear the stretch out everywhere!!! absolutely terrible! i have several pairs of cartonnier crops that are my ""go to"" pants, but these are not worth even the sale price! i'd give them no stars if i could!! this fabric is very different from my other printed pairs. if u must try them, size down and suffer through the first few ""tight"" hours! trust me...they will",1
"Super soft comfy underwear. i sized up and they fit perfectly. normally wear xs and bought m for most comfortable fit. they don't ride up. i ended up ordering 5 more pairs. super comfy without being too ""mom"" like.",5

This is a great sweater. soft and beautiful. it's my new go to sweater??,5
"I'd been eyeing this skirt on the website, and was pleasantly surprised to find one hanging on the sale rack in a local store. i couldn't leave it behind. the silver embroidery and the lovely, flowinng weight of the tulle layers make this a beautiful skirt. i'm just over 5"" 4"" and it skims the floor on me with a 2"" heel. can't wait to wear it!",5
"I love this vest and could not leave without it. the color and lining just make it perfect, so stylish and comfy! i'm always a 8/10 and a m in this was perfect. the color is so beautiful and its so easy to dress up and down. i am big on the bottom, the tie in the back adds a nice shape to your whole profile and makes it a less boxy vest! love love...",5
"Saw this online and ran over to the store to try it on. so lovely! i thought i would want it in the cream color but the blue was so lovely in person. it's like a muted blue that makes it so versatile. the detail in the back is gorgeous and so flattering. the safety pin is such a unique touch. it's nice and warm, just not super soft, but not scratchy. i do think i will be extra careful with it because it seems like it could get caught on things easily.",5
"Love this shirt. i am 5'2"" and 115 lbs. i am normally a pxs and got the pxxs and it got perfect! my new favorite shirt.",5
"This dress is very beautiful. the dark color makes it very elegant. i tried on different top (white, silver, light blue, etc). they all look very nice with the dress. you can wear it casually or formally...depending on what kind of top you wear.",5
"Have been looking for a motorcycle style sweater for a while and hit the jackpot with this one. i have a large 34g bust and it's hard to find one without overly large lapels. these are perfect and they stay down, which is hard to find too. perfect length, beautiful color. not too long in the back. it has zipper pockets and the photos don't show the silver grommets on each side at the hem. the body of the sweater has a different knit than the sleeves so it has a bit of that vest over sweater look",5
"This sweater is very cute. i got a medium, i'm broad in the shoulders and a 34c. i wanted it a little loose. threw it over a tshirt and was not itchy at all. i feel it is light weight and perfect for our mild winters in florida. can't wait till the weather cools down to wear it.",5
"Was hesitant to order it as first since i was worried it might be a little too boxy in person. glad i tried it since that turned out not to be the case. drapes nicely (exactly like in the picture) and can be worn either on its own or layered with a cardigan/shrug. loose fit means i can wear it to work, too. am usually between a small and xs but the xs fit me well. also wanted to mention this hits me right under the waist and i'm 5ft4 so there is a chance it could be a little too short for someon",5
"I'm wearing lots of these long cardigans right now. this one is comfortable but holds up well. the blue color is a lovely wedgewood blue. the little tie detail on the back of the neck is cute, but doesn't get in the way. it's great for casual or casual work wear.",5
"Great, rather heavyweight, long cardi. i purchased the blue, which is a lovely shade of gray/blue, not quite as bright as the picture depicts. pin is adorable; doubt i'll ever use it to close the sweater, but still a nice touch. for reference i'm 5'5"", 136 lbs, 34ddd and typically fall between size small and medium. took a medium in this one and glad i did. perfect fit. falls exactly like on the model.",5
"Beware! there is a reason this sweater is on sale. it is not even remotely the same color as pictured. instead of the lovely antique blue in the photo, this sweater is a faded, boring, teal-green. what a huge disappointment.",1
"Love the distressed look and linen-like texture. the back ties cinch in for a custom fit & the knit hood is a nice touch. the length is great! fits tts (exactly as depicted) if not slightly roomy, which i like. absolutely fabulous!",5
I knew i had to have these when i saw them on one of the retailer store instagrams. i bought them in the blue color combo and they are very comfortable and can be dressed up for work or paired with more casual clothing because of the material. they run a little large and have a lot of stretch so i would size down.,5
"These pants are amazing and great quality! thank you to the reviewers who suggested sizing up one size. the trousers don't have a lot of stretch and are very cute and well-made and the size up is perfect! i am normally a 2r in most pants and skirts and i sized up to a 4r, they are perfect. gorgeous pattern, and i too, am not a ""pattern""-type. will go perfectly with a number of the solid, flowy maeve tops i have for work.",5
"This vest is the one thing i will wear all year round. i couldn't wait for this to arrive, it looks and fits just like the pictures. great quality and value, is very stylish and adds a little flair to a simple top and jeans outfit. i have worn it several times and, in addition to looking great does keep you warm.",5
"I am not really a ""print person"" but cartonnier gets it right every time - modern prints that lend themselves to many styling and paring options. the charlie trouser, which they do every season, is a great fitting pant (going up a size is a must as they do run small) with details (stitching, buttons, pockets) that make their pants look more expensive than they actually are.
i bought these in the blue combo when i saw them at my local retailer store. the blue combo has both blue and black (as well",5
"I have the blue version. i love the bold, pop art pattern. the colors are strong but neutral enough to pair with a myriad of different options for the top.",5
"I agree with the last reviewer this is a great cozy sweater. i took an xs regular and i am 5'6"" 108lbs. the pin is used to close the sweater (no button). plenty of hand-knit sweater vests,wraps,shawls come with or are given with pins for closure. you will find many uses for the pin but as it is shown in the photo..... not likely.",5
"I got this planning to wear to a wedding, but have dressed it up for a gala event and down with a white sleeveless top to an awards ceremony. i've definitely gotten some mileage out of it! like the other reviews said, it is long, but was able to easily trim excess fabric from the bottom and it works perfect with wedges. love it!",5
"These pants are very, very cute and high quality. they can be worn with a variety of colors and can be dressed up or down. they are also very flattering. i definitely recommend sizing up as they run small. my normal size was a tad tight in the waist and there is very little stretch - but the next size up was perfect.",5
"Let me talk about the fit. i am a size 6 petite. i weigh 120 and am 5' tall. i am curvy and have short legs. what little height i have is in my torso. that being said, i ordered the 6p and the 6. no doubt about it! the 6p fits like a 4p. the 6p was tight in the hips and thighs. the size 6 regular was a perfect fit. if you want the pant to have s cropped look like in the picture then order up a size and stay in petite. so i would have ordered a 8p i'd i wanted the cropped look like in the pic. bu",5
"I love this blouse, it's very unique and gorgeous. this blouse is versatile with short, jean and skirt. love it!!!",5
This skirt is very comfortable and fits tts or even runs a bit large. i was able to dress it up with a great white shirt and statement necklace. great find.,5
"This dress is even more gorgeous in person! i had seen in the spring catalog but liked it even more when i spotted it at my local store. i have been searching for the perfect ivory crochet or lace dress each summer for the past few years. i think i have finally found ""the one'! i should note i am 5'9"" and this dress goes all the way to my knees. it may swallow someone on the shorter side.",5
"I love, love love this top. i've bought several over the years and they wash great and are very flattering and comfortable. i always pick up the newest color.",5
This is one of my favorite.it is timeless for sure.,5
"I stared at this dress for a long time online and finally went into the store and tried it on. it is a beautiful quality and material. note that it is ivory, not pure white, which is exactly what i was looking for. the fit is more of an a-line and it is slightly long which is part of the style of the dress. i am taking it with me to a beach vacation in mexico but i plan to wear to many more occasions because this could easily be dressed up or down. just don't wear it to a wedding since it is a w",5
Super comfy skirt!  can't wait to wear it to football games this season!,5
"This dress is gorgeous. more ivory in person. the crochet is amazing. i sized up from my normal s to a m, only bc i wanted a loose fit. and after reading reviews that it fit a little bit like a shift, i wanted a bigger size. but a small would have prob worked as well. depends on how you want this to fit. i love it. i wear mine now w a cropped jean jacket and leggings, soon w just sandals. great transition piece bc it's a slightly heavy dress but not enough to be overwhelming or hot for the summe",5
"I absolutely love this dress. i'm always leery about buying lace and white, but i love this off-white color and style. i was able to stretch the sleeves a tad to make them more fluttery, but they aren't as fluttery as the photo looks. definitely more of a cap sleeve. got so many compliments!",5
"This skirt is really adorable, but only if you're going to tuck in your tops. the pockets flare out at the top, so shirts don't lay correctly on them. instead the bottom of the shirt floofs out and looks really dumpy. tucked in though, super cute!

the waist is really tiny and the fabric has no stretch to speak of. i usually take a 0/2 pant or 25/26 jean. i ordered the xsmall and could only get the top fastened by really sucking it in and struggling. i'll be exchanging for a small, hopefully t",5
I love this dress. the fit is great for tall girls i'm 5 9' and the length is perfect. can be dressed down with cute sneakers or up with heels. every time i wear this dress i get a ton of compliments and it is so comfortable.,5
"Love, love, love this little lbd!
lots of rich detail and still very easy and laid back. dress up or dress down.
i will be wearing this into the fall season. i purchased the l, still roomy, tried the m but a little snug in the shoulders and chest. i am usually a size 12, d cup. very flattering style boho chic.",5
"Purchased this dress in black and love it. there is so much detail in the crochet, and can be dressed up or down. i am contemplating buying the same dress in white!",5
"These jeans look amazing on. i'm 5'5"" and an hourglass figure and these fit perfectly. if you like high waisted jeans, these are for you! a small heal does need to be worn but i wouldn't say they are excessively long.",5
"Love love love this dress! have received so many compliments on it. i'm 5'4"", 118 and xs fit perfectly. love the cap sleeves and details, super comfortable too. i can see wearing this year-round and dressing it up/down.",5
"I'm really looking forward to wearing this skort on vacation in hawaii. it's a great color, soft, flowy, fun, practical.",5
"This is stunning. even more stunning in person. the crochet is divine. every inch of it is beautifully detailed. it's got a bit of weight to it and the crochet is very high quality. i am normally a l or xl, and i have curves. this is why this unfortunately did not work for me. it fits more like a shift with a little more aline room. on the right shape, it will be perfect. if you're curvy, size up. if you're lean or narrow, you might want to size down. the length is heavenly for tall gals, but wi",5
"This is a beautiful, high-quality little black dress. it actually has a little weight to it, but nothing bothersome. i usually take a medium across the board, but i had to size up to a large. this is dress has more of a straight line versus a-line and i have wider hips, so the large fit really good. it's beautiful and versatile. i just wore it to my high school reunion and got compliments : ) great purchase, i would highly recommend.",5
Great summer skort! these are exactly what i have been looking for to wear to the carribean! the material is substantial but not enough to be hot nor too little to be called thin. the skort is constructed well with nice flow between the skirt and short portion which is sometimes a miss with other skorts i have tried on. it does run slightly large. i also sized down after initially trying on the one in the photo.,5
"For anyone who loves lace. it fits pretty true to size. the size m length hits just to the top of the knee. i' 5' 4"" tall. to lighten up the dress just a little so that it does not look as some have said ""frumpy"" i hemmed the liner so that the liner hem is half way up on the ruffle. this makes the dress look less heavy, more fun, and repeats the openness of the lace on top. love this dress! will be wore a lot for summer evenings out.",5
"The look is frest, crisp with a touch of romance. very retailer!",5
Ordered a few things for a last minute decision on what to wear to a wedding - i slipped this on right out of the box and decision was made! tunic style is great for all body types and hides any bulges. crochet neckline and sleeves are cute and a little sexy. dress is very comfortable and not too short. wore this with pearls and ankle-strap pumps for a dressier look. very happy with this one!,5
"I just tried these on today in the store. i'm 5'5 and found that they were definitely the right length for heels. the 33"" inseam is correct. however, i had them ordered in a petite so i could wear them with flats. these are super cute jeans!!!",5
"Wow! i had been looking at these shorts online...then found only one pair left at my store in a size four--a size i can sometimes squeeze into...luckily, these really do run a full size larger without being snug/too tight...$19.95 with 40% off!!!???? yes please,  cannot wait to wear them next summer! and p.s. per above reviewer, you do need need to cut the cross strings at the pleats--they are just meant to keep the shorts nicely pressed/flat in the store, then you are on your own!",5
Great green color. drapes well. nice gray detailing adds dimension to an already pretty sweater.,5
"Fits just like on the model, even though im 5'4''. really happy with this casual summer find.",5
"When i saw this sweater, it made me think of the 70's chic trend thats very now but due to the colors (my favorite tones) it would be something i would be reaching for for years to come. i love it combined with jeans but i also worse it over a dress (see photo) - i am wearing it over corey lynn calter floral dress ""paeonia dress"", and i paired it with the ""rosebud layered necklace"". i got two of this sweater as i want to have one for when i wear the first one out :) i am 5'6"", 127 and even thoug",5
"I thought this dress would make me look washed out, but absolutely doesn't--beautiful pop of color, and unique design. i've received many complements, this one is a keeper.",5
This dress is super cute and sexy. i bought the taupe in a size medium. for reference i'm tall (5'11) and weigh about 152. i don't know how tall the last reviewer is but this was not too short in the front for me. i really like it.,5
I tried on the petite in the store and loved it it's just the color kind of washes me out a bit... nut i did love hte fit and style...,5
This sweater has a retro feel to it. i like how it hits right at the hips and it's not too long or not too short. it keeps you warm and it's a nice alternative to all the drab sweaters that you would usually wear in the fall or winter.,5
I love the unique style of this dress. the bell sleeves and the rather fitted body that poofs out at the end put the focus on these details. as for fit ... i'm a standard xs petite and the xsp fits to a tee.,5
"I ordered the pink and it is the slightest hint of pink mixed with ivory. it fits true to size. the detailing of the crochet is outstanding. it reminds me of seashells that my daughter & i collected last year when we visited san diego. i wish the teal green one would be in stock in xl. i would grab it up. it's not the softest knit, but it's very comfortable to wear all day. very pretty version of a cardigan.",5
"Even at a very deep discount, this piece is definitely not worth the money. the picture made me think this jacket had a longer curved velvet hem as part of its design (which would be cool)--which is largely what attracted me to it, but as i discovered when it arrived, that was actually part of the shirt worn beneath in the photo. so this image is rather misleading. the actual jacket is very thin--more like a shirt with an open front than a jacket. the pockets are just loosely tacked inside. for",1
"I love this dress. i bought this dress in both a m and a s. i was worried about how ""loose"" the dress would fit and also how short it would be. the information about the model wearing the dress only said that she was 5'10"" but not what size dress she was wearing. i am 5'11"" and am in between a dress size 2 or 4. the medium was way too wide, but the small was still long enough with the perfect amount of flow. i purchased the green/slate color, which is more green and has very faint stripes. very",5
"I disagree with the other reviewer - i thought the fabric of this skirt was high quality, and while it wasn't lined i don't think lining is typical in a sweater material. i also really liked the patter and the swingy bell shape. i usually wear a 6 or 8, but my store only had a 4 available. it fit, but was a little tight in the hips. the skirt was also longer on me then on the model, but i'm on the short side.",5
"This is a sweater i love to look at and wear for any occasion. it looks on me almost exactly like the model picture in the online photo. i'm 5'6"". i bought a small and it fits very loose and comfortable. i would suggest 1 size smaller than usual would fit well. i usually wear small for tops and medium dresses. it is great to layer with a brown or rusty copper large cardigan. it has a somewhat southwest blanket look with its colors of soft apricot and soft brown plus 1 turquoise stripe. it dresse",5
This product was offered in a pink color which compliments many color palettes. perfect for layering.,5
Fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well.,5
Love this dress! it's so soft & not to short like some retailer dresses. great transition piece! i'm a fan of bell sleeves & can't wait to wear this with boots& tights this fall.,5
The malabar moto vest is made of a beautifully soft fabric and is lined on the inside. the added details - pockets and epaulets - are a plus. the vest has snaps and a zipper. the length is just right and the vest has a flattering shape.,5
"Uhm no. oh dear, no. i was initially drawn to this blouse's lovely fabric, the color and pattern are truly stunning. i decided to give it a try because it seemed somewhat boxy, oh boy was i right. sadly, this is one of the least flattering tops that i've ever tried on at retailer. it might be a great maternity top, though.",1
"The photo does a disservice to this beautiful sweater it is truly special with a lace scallop pattern down the front and across to the back. it is absolutely beautiful!! the sweater is lightweight, perfect for a cool day or in an office on a cold day.. i snapped up the grey and may purchase the green if it goes on sale.(unless they can show this sweater off better i am certain it will.) i am usually right between a small and a medium and needed the medium in this sweater. the small was bit tight",5
"I love these leggings so much i bought them in every color/design!!! they are amazing!
super stretchy and great for an active lifestyle be it pilates, yoga, playing with kids at the park or coffe with the girls.",5
I ordered my usual size-small. it is perfect because it has enough room to fit a thin shirt or turtleneck underneath when the weather is cooler. the material is very soft. looking forward to a lot of wear out of this vest.,5
"I ordered my usual size 6 from retailer and it fit perfect. for reference i am 5'8"" and 137 pounds. unlike the other reviewer i did not have trouble getting into or out of dress. it buttons down the middle so you just need to make sure you undo them enough to get past your chest;) i really like this dress. i think it's beautifully made. is it my favorite dress i've purchased from retailer, no but still a nice dress:)",5
I just received this in the wine color and it's gorgeous! it fits well and is very pretty. it can be dressed up or down. i can't wait until the weather warms up and i get to wear this. i have already ordered the other color! great purchase.,5
"This shirt fits very closely to the body. it has a very strange fit in the shoulder, though. the arms themselves are really long, far past my hands, yet it's very tight in the shoulder and under arm area. for reference, i am 5'10"", 130 pounds and ordered a small, which is what i usually need.",1
"This sweater drapes beautifully, but beware it is pretty light weight and feels more poly or nylon than wool. i dont know if you could wear a top with sleeves underneath either, it will probably work best with just a cami. that said, i love the style. note... the sweater is pretty long. i am 5'2 and normally 12-14p and the regular size came down to my knees. the lp was perfect, just covers my tush and has adequate room for curves.",5
"This adorable dress has surpassed my expectations! i ordered an xs and s and am keeping the xs. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, and the xs fits like a dream. it's not sack-like at all. the top is fitted, and the bottom flairs very flatteringly. the bell sleeves aren't too long like some i've seen. the color and print are the epitome of fall! the length is perfect; it's long enough for work but short and flirty enough for evenings out. i can imagine wearing with heels or booties.",5
I bought the xs and love it. it looks better on than in the picture. it travels well (no wrinkles after being in the suitcase) and it is generous on the sides so you can actually eat a full lunch and not feel boxed in afterwards.,5
"This is so retailer - pretty in pink, unique design and print. i love origami and i love pink, and this blouse is a perfect combo. i ordered size petite s (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fits perfectly (the hem falls on the upper hips, just like shown on the model). the top has structure, not too soft and not too stiff. i think the sleeves are very unique and great for those gals who are conscious about their big arms, like me. this top has everything: flair, bright color, unique print, but al",5
Such a pretty pink feminine blouse. love the sleeves! great quality and true to size.,5
"I love this skirt! it is sooooo cute!! fits true to size and the color is beautiful. the cut out in the front gives the skirt a sexy touch, the fabric is very nice, i am in love! this was one of my best purchases from retailer!",5
Purchased this in green and love the color. it drapes well - not too long on me and hung just past my hips. it has very thin sleeves as other review mentioned to cannot wear anything bulky underneath. overall very happy with this purchase.,5
I absolutely love this top! cute and feminine without being over the top. i basically love everything meadow rue puts out there...and this was no exception.,5
"Love this tee, purchased the blue and white, i usually wear xs in many retailer items but opted for a medium in this tee so it would fit loose. works good not fitting too tight. i like it because it's a tee shirt but it's a little dressy, great for going out to dinner, etc...",5
"I wanted this so badly, to wear as a dress over a slip. but it is not cute or flattering when you put it on. it made me look 20 pounds heavier than i am, and the fit was awful. i usually wear an xs in dresses at retailer and this swallowed me. i am petite but this is just waaaaaay too big. so disappointed because it's so pretty.",1
This top is comfortable and vas easily be dressed up or down! love it,5
This sweater is quite lovely. the yarn is light and delicate and the sweater is over all very feminine and figure flattering. i bought the light red color which is quite attractive and i'm not usually a fan of reds and pinks. this sweater can be worn casually with jeans or more dressed up for the office. anyone that is looking for a sweater that can be worn with almost anything should defiantly consider this one.,5
"Love this one. i usually wear a medium, got this in medium and fits perfectly. i agree with the prior reviewer regarding the arms, they are a little snug, but i like the fit just as is. the pattern and medium thinkness were just what i was looking for.",5
"Beautiful jacket for a light day. fits a little large., so if you want it to fit a little more tailored look, order down a size.",5
"I think this jacket is meant to be large on for a particular look. with an xs i had no problem. it's large, but slouchy and cute. i adore it!",5
It is a great sweater that is soft but also warm i love the pretty design,5
"Love this jacket. it's soft and a beautiful shade of ivory. perfect for casual wear with a pair of black jeans, while still maintaining an elegant look.",5
"First of all, the one that looks white is actually a powder blue color. this isn't necessarily bad, but i would have really liked a white one and i was disappointed when it arrived blue. i should have looked more closely at the picture and paid attention to the very unreliable color button on the website.

at any rate, i like this skirt a lot as a causal everyday piece of clothing. in the summers, i tend to wear skirts rather than shorts and am always on the lookout for something that is not t",5
"I purchased the purple t with letters all over. great fit, long and not clingy at all. i love the 80's motif/style of the letters. perfect t-shirt for a teacher.
the black design was strange - hearts, fox, cats... it just seemed random and no theme. i would buy colors of this t-shirt because it fits so well, but the black ""green"" design was too off.",5
"Very cute jumpsuit, especially for those who want to ease into the jumpsuit style. it looks very much like a dress but is very flattering as a jumpsuit because of the wide legs. the pattern is striking and bold but not garish. it has a low plunging neckline so you may need a camisole underneath (i did!) even though it has padding for those who want to go braless. i purchased a 2p and it fit my 5'3, 115 lbs frame perfectly. i would highly recommend!",5
"My new go to skirt. great color for transitioning from summer to fall. i love the pockets and detailing, and yes, oh so soft...",5
I love this little topper. it is very comfortable. it looks elegant.,5
"I can't get over how fabulous this looks on, how well it fits, and how flattering it is. i'm 5'8"" and size 8/10 on a good day. seriously - i'm so happy about it ! i plan to get a lot of wear out of it - works for a wedding, evening out, or the office.",5
"I tried this topper sweater on at the store but wanted to wait for it to go on sale so i just purchased it with my extra thirty percent off and think it's such a nice deal. i really like how this one is soft, well made, has nice long sleeves and how adorable the inside lining is. the lining matches the print inside the pockets that peak out a bit. i didn't find this one too boxy for me as it's a topper after all. there are no closure buttons or clasps but i think it's a great piece to throw on w",5
"Great skirt, fits as expected. very cute, can be dressed up or down. i love the pockets!!",5
"I've seriously been on the hunt for a olive green military-ish style skirt for a couple years now and i think i've found it! the color is great! the finishings are cool(rose gold buttons!) i actually like the a-line, it give me room to sit down without riding up. the waist is pretty fitted, verging on tight and i ordered an 8. i'm usually a 6 or 8 in bottoms, but i need to trim off a few pounds from a recent vaca! so i'm keeping the 8, it will probably be perfect soon enough! the length is just",5
"Love love love this jumpsuit! normally i stay away from jumpsuits because i hate to have to completely undress to use the bathroom, but this was too cute to pass up. fits great, extremely flattering to my athletic build, super comfy. it sort of looks like a maxi-dress due to the wide legs. length was perfect. i am 5'3"" and did not have to hem it.",5
I bought this in navy - it is absolutely stunning and looks like a dress on. super flattering and i don't even need to wear a bra with it,5
"This was absolutely adorable on. it does look a bit like a dress but at 5'3 and 118 lbs i am normally a size 4, and needed the 2 in this. it fit so perfectly i didn't consider the petite. i can go braless as it has a well lined build in supportive bra. i purchased both colors and it can be dressed up or down. only draw back is dry clean only. super cute, and i definitely recommend this. cuter in person and on.",5
"I loved this at first sight, and ordered it in a 10, 12, and 14 to make sure i'd get one that fit me. (i ended up with the 12). i wear a 32 dd bra, so usually braless is not an option, but this actually offers enough support. and, if i do want to wear a bra it's got a well placed strap across the back that will cover it. 

it's super flattering, and really fun to wear out day or night.",5
"I ordered the mustard shade in size xl. it is so well-made & comfortable. the patterned lining makes it extra cute and extra soft to wear. it's washed well too. i like the shorter length. it it fun to play with proportions when using it. i ordered the navy in xl since i've gotten such great use out of the yellow one. it hasn't shed/pilled either. well-made, quirky and useful for layering!",5
The fit on this skirt is flawless. i usually need alterations at the waist but this one was perfect for me. the buttons are so adorable and the color (orange) is vibrant and perfect for spring and summer. will wear this a lot!,5
This lovely cardigan is just that much more special due to the lining on the body and in the pockets. they peek out and make the sweater more interesting. i wore the black one with a lace dress with cream underlayment and the cream details on the lining worked perfectly to offset the formality of the dress and make the whole outfit casual but chic. the sweater washed in the machine and kept its shape when i hung it to dry.,5
Fits great and i love the length. very cute skirt!,5
"If you're a little afraid to rock a jumpsuit this one's for you. the palazzo leg makes it look a lot like a dress. a light shelf bra was very supportive even for my d/dd cup. it does run large. i'm typically a 14/16 and was easily able to fit in the 12, although the look it a bit racier on me due to cleavage. hides any tummy you might have very well due to the flowing cut. the fabric is light and comfortable. my only complaint is i wish it was a tad longer. i can not wait to rock this at a weddi",5
"A great staple to pull out on chilly mornings. i am 5'9"" so the arm length was perfect",5
This was so boxy and unflattering. i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag. was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit. sizing down would not help this one. went back!,1
This skirt is really cute and very comfortable. i can dress it up for work or dress it down for casual. fun color too.,5
I saw this on line this morning and was hesitant to order one size smaller so decided to visit local anthopology store with fingers crossed they would have it in a size 4. i'm 5'5 130 and a size 6 usually in retailer clothing. not only was the size 4 perfect the fabric and quality are excellent. nice flowy pant legs and the top has a one button adjustment on the shoulder if you don't want it too low. either way worked for myself. dress up or down. this is a must!,5
"I saw these sweaters in the store this fall and took a pass - they didn't look cute and i thought they wouldn't be cute on, because the little pockets looked droopy --but i was so wrong! once they went on sale, i took a chance b.c. i needed a black lightweight cardigan for a trip. ordered a size small and it fits perfect - so cute, i just love it! glad i bought it at the sale price because now i'm even happier!",5
"Love this skirt... perfect length and cut! pilcro, make more of these!!!! i ordered up so that it hug more on my hips than waist, just prefer that better, but i think if you can pull of the waist look, go for it! would buy more in different colors!",5
Just got this skirt in the mail and i am so happy i took a chance and ordered it! my waist is a lot smaller than my hips so skirts can be a challenge! but this one fit me perfectly! it is casual but i can also see myself wearing this to work in the summer months. it is super flattering and very comfortable! the fabric is soft and it does have some give. i am usually a size 30 in pilcro chinos and the size 10 in this skirt fit me perfectly. so i would say it runs true to size. a great addition to,5
"I was obsessed with this dress/jumpsuit after i read all the great reviews, even tho i had never seen it in person. it was already on sale and sold out online, so i called a bunch of stores and finally was able to track one down in the navy colorway in my size (it's tts). so glad i made the effort! it's as great as everyone says it is. i love how it's ""party in the back."" i'm 5'3"" so it was pretty much floor length on me.",5
"I'm in love with these jeans! they come very long, but it's easy to cut them down where you want them since they are not hemmed. i have a short torso so for me they were high waisted, but still flattering, which surprised me! for reference, i am 5'2, 105#, and i got the size 24.",5
"I got the blue with polka dots. it fits more like a midi dress. it is a bit large, i'm usually a size 10 and got a size 8. it's gorgeous on. i don't think i'll be needing a bra underneath this. it's got a supportive band and the ribbon also helps. i might order the other bold print too, it just looks so good on.",5
"This jumpsuit runs large so i sized down perfectly one full size down. i have a size b chest and was very comfortable with no bra, as the built in cups gave me the perfect coverage. it looked like a dress standing, but had such a flattering and fun shape when you move. everyone loved it!",5
"I tried it on and it fit like a glove. i'm only 5'2"" and i can wear with heals or flats. great built in bra. i'm a c cup and i've got a bubble butt. very flattering on my figure. quality worth every penny. many compliments. work appropriate or a luncheon! my fav retailer purchase by far.",5
"I bought the skirt in green in size 6 (i am 5'4"" and 143 lbs). it fit very well and was very flattering and the length was perfect. i can see myself wearing it a lot this spring and in summer.",5
Blue jeans that fit like a dream & they were on sale.,5
Gorgeous dress worth every penny--one of a kind twist on a kimono!,5
I love this jumper!  it is absolutely gorgeous and also quite possibly the most comfortable piece of clothing i've ever owned.,5
"I am so happy i splurged and bought these jeans. based on the other reviewer, i ordered one size up, and they fit perfectly. i'm 5'8 and appreciate the longer inseam. i can't wear a wedge heel or anything with them, but with a flat on they skim the floor perfectly. you'll love the raw hemline and the subtle ""wear"" throughout the fabric. it's not overdone. just like in the picture, they really seem to narrow the hip, think page boy style. very, very flattering!",5
"This is a skirt i will wear every day in the summer...great green/khaki color, casual. fit me like all the retailer size
8's do...perfect... only one thing...it is not as short as it looks on this model. i am going to have to have it shortened...but that is not biggy. the skirt is everything i hoped t would be and i know i will wear it to death.",5
"I'm 5'7"", 120 lbs, size 0 was best.  ordered the green color.  great flattering fit!",5
"I love hd paris styles & this jumpsuit appealed to me online so i ordered a 6p. i am usually a 4 or 6 in regular sizes at retailer. i decided the regular size may be too long & too much fabric for me. i am 5'3"", 118#, 36c. it was easy to slip into it, zip up the back & tie the black ribbon in the back. it doesn't say in the 'details' that it has a built-in bra which is a good feature. the bra cups are a little small on me but not a deal-breaker. the length is fine falling just above my ankles. i j",5
"I like the detail in this cardigan. the shape is true to the fit on the model of the main picture, the sleeves are a bit long, however i am 5'2.5 and 107 lbs, i ordered and kept the xxsp. great staple item!",5
"The is such a cute a-line skirt and perfect for the summer with a white tee. i bought the moss color and the rose gold buttons on it look really pretty. i'm 5'1 ,103 pounds and bought the 00 regular since i did not want to go too short with the petite size. it does run slightly big so order a size down if you have a smaller waist. love this and the price!",5
"These jeans are fantastic - the denim is very high quality and the fit is true to size. the dark rinse is very flattering and pairs well with almost anything. my only (small) gripe is that the length is a bit awkward. i'm 5'4"" and it fits more like a regular pair of jeans, not ankle-length. just something to keep in mind if you're not super tall like the model in the picture.",5
"I really loved this skirt on the model. i ordered it in my typical 0 and it fit well. the green was adorable, and the buttons are rose gold, which is quite pretty. i did exchange this skirt for a 2, only because the 0 was just too short for me. if the 2 is a bit longer but not terribly huge in the waist, i will probably keep it. i was surprised by how large the a line felt, but i think i can get used to it. it really is very fun, and very easy to dress up or down. i'm really hoping the bigger si",5
"I absolutely love this skirt! i feel like the color works well for most seasons: you can pair it with a light tee or tank top and some sandals during warmer months, or layer it with a sweater, thick tights and boots in autumn. really nice staple piece for your wardrobe. i do think it runs a bit large: i generally wear a 6 (depending on the brand and style), but this 6 was way too large around my waist by at least a couple inches. i returned it and got a 4, which fit me perfectly. it's nice that",5
This skirt makes me look at least a size smaller. i love it! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top. tts- got my usual 10 in green.,5
"Thank you pilcro for making a skirt that is a great alternative to shorts or capris. i bought the green skirt and wore it on vacation. i realized a lighter color would be nice for summer, and ordered the light blue. it's tempting to get the red as well. the fit is great. i am 5'7 and the length is perfect. the skirt has weight. i am sure i will wear both of my skirts time and time again.",5
"These leggings are very comfortable with a bit of control. i ordered the m and they fit perfectly, as usual i do have to tuck the hem up just a bit but i have to do that with all my leggings. i love the laser cut detail on the side which is a lavender color.",5
"Runs a bit small, but this top is super soft like all the cloth and stone tops. great for all seasons!!",5
"I'm not a western girl but this dress is so adorable. i love the colors, it's adorable and unique. while its definitely a full swingy shirt dress i didn't find it overly large. i plan on wearing as a dress with sleeves rolled up. under the pilcro denim jacket it looks so cute. and open over jeans with a white tank like a jacket.",5
"I already have one pair of sleep pants by retailer and was looking for a second pair. i wanted something warm and comfortable for the fall and upcoming winter weather. (i live in the rockies.) as soon as i saw the woodland animal print on these pants i had to try them. i mean seriously, how cute are the raccoons and other critters here? when they arrived at first i thought they might be too thin for winter wear, but when i put them on i was pleasantly surprised by the soft, comfy fabric. i",5
"I am not sure who in the world could really wear this as a dress without belting it...definitely a super weird cut. extreme a-frame. the fabric is just absolutely gorgeous and it is so well made otherwise. i thought about trying to size down but it would be too small in the shoulders for sure. i am going to keep anyway. i've already worn it with jeans and a t-shirt and as a topper with a denim shirt dress. it actually looked fantastic with both. i'll get a lot of wear out of it, just not the way",5
"This is a very cute fall dress that can be worn in a myriad of styles. from styling it with a pair of wedges and dark tights, to donning a bolo and ankle boots, heads will turn when you walk into the room.",5
I bought these pants for my girlfriend for christmas. she really loved them! the material the pants are made of is very comfortable. the animals are super cute too.,5
I cant say enough about these pants - they are such good quality. i bought the xs. they are tight enough and don't create crease in my legs. length is perfect for my 5.1 statue.,5
Super cozy! now that the colder weather is coming i will likely be wearing these every night relaxing at home!!,5
"I am a frequent retailer shopper who has found many items to be hit or miss. this one's a definite hit:) i absolutely love the vibe of this sweater wrap (unique, bohemian, feminine, cozy), the fabric (beautiful intricate weave, high quality knit, wearable virtually year-round thanks to air conditioning), how stylish it is (fringe, very ""in"" kimono cocoon cardigan), how much of my wardrobe it goes with (neutral ivory color that can be dressed up or down, elegant or casual), and the fact that it has",5
I saw this shirt and new that i had to have it. i love the tassel on the back at the tie. the fabric is not too sheer. the fit is loose and will be cool this summer.,5
"I saw this dress in my local retailer store and had to try it on. i cannot say enough good things about this dress! i love it!
 like other reviewers said it runs very big. i am 5'8"" 138 pounds and usually wear a size 6 but got this in a 2. fits like a shirt dress should once i sized down.",5
Love this top!!!! it is just gorgeous and fits great!,5
"These are very cool leggings. the cut out design really puts them several classes above a simple black legging. they can be worn with dressier tops and could be a sophisticated looking outfit. i wore them for the first time today and really loved them. i didn't feel like i was out in ""leggings"" but more like i was wearing a nice pair of pants. the fabric is soft and the cut is very flattering all over - including the rear. they are definitely sculpting and firming. they fit the same size-wise as",5
"Based on others' reviews, i knew i needed to try this beauty on to be sure of my size. as others mentioned, it runs 1-2 sizes large. but, unlike others, i don't feel i need a belt at the waist. i am 5'2"" 140# 34d and with my body style (super short and not super slim in the waist but also busty) this is the perfect boho fit and the perfect drape!!!  and the design and quality are superb to boot!!!",5
"As the other reviewers stated, it does run large, i sized down 1 size and it's perfect. great dress to wear so many ways.",5
"This cardigan can be dressed up with leggings and booties or dressed down with jeans and chucks. i love the fit of the small (5''3"" and small/medium build). would highly recommend for a dinner out or lounging around at home.",5
"This dress is loose, unique, and super cute! you'll get noticed in this dress! i ordered down a size.",5
"I tried this shirt in a small (my usual retailer size) and it was very unflattering.   the fabric was ultra soft and it seemed it was nicely made.  however, this shirt is so unstructured and oversized, i might as well worn a brown paper bag.",1
"Totally out of my style range but am totally enamored by this tent dress/shirt/coat thing! ok, so yes it's very very tenty, but fits on my shoulders (size down 1x or 2x if you're narrow shouldered) and i use one of my leather belts to gather the material and make myself a nice western fit & flare! like the model shots, this looks great with a tee and skinnies. if you have tried the marvelous silk santee swing dress, the escalante has the same amount of fabric that reviewer either love or hate. i",5
I love this top. i ordered it online thinking that it would be a comfy top for the weekends and i was right. the front is a heavier fabric than the whisper thin tops and yet the back is a wonderfully lightweight cotton handkerchief feel. i am petite and it fits great.,5
"I had this on my birthday list and was really hopeful that it'd work out based on all of the good reviews. when i got it, i was happy with the fit and fabric, but i was stumped as to what i'd wear it with. it hung in the closet for a couple of weeks because i just didn't know if i could pull off the length. i took the plunge today and find it pairs nicely with a flared leg pant and simple shirt underneath. it's so stretchy, warm, and cozy! the sweater does shed as another reviewer mentioned so k",5
"I love the design of these. the laser cut outs are solid and hold up in the wash. they are great for work-outs and cute enough to wear as leggings out. i wore them to my bar method class, came home and just changed my top and continued wearing them the rest of the day as a cute outfit. they have a great snug fit and the fabric is thick and durable.",5
I cant say enough about this top. the material is soft and comfy . very well made. the length and  size is spot on! looks great tucked in or out! very versatile. highly recommend!!,5
"I liked this blouse very much the minute i first seen it, it looks exactly as pictured but sits much better in person. i'm 6ft tall 160lb ordered a 10 which was true to size with a little more room to the bottom. i was able to see my belly button through the sheer part of the bottom fabric, but as soon as i sucked my belly in, it was fine. the quality of the fabric is so-so i had some threads hanging out here and there, but this top looks very good in person and the design is unique, you can hav",5
"I just purchased this cute dress on sale and made sure to size down one size so instead of my regular small, i ordered an extra small which fits me perfectly. i'm a petite yet busty 34d-27-35 and 5'4"" and think the dress looks adorable on especially since i'm a huge fan of all things plaid. it's a lighter weight dress so it's perfect for spring or summer but can be worn in fall/winter with this color scheme by adding tights, boots and a sweater or jacket. i also love that it has pockets. i don't",5
"This shirt is perfect. hangs nicely, and i love the little longer sleeves.

beautiful color too!",5
I was so surprised by this jacket! i grabbed it as a last minute thought and then when i tried it on i was in love! i have a pink dress i'm going to wear it over but i also love it over a frilly off white tank or even just over a basic t. i am so excited for cooler weather. be warned its not lined or warm. its more of a shirt than a true jacket but it's perfect for fall in california. i wear a small or m and went with a medium on this one.,5
"Love this skirt, easy to wear and very flattering. looks better in person, i saw it at the store and bought it; when i looked at it on-line i didn't realize it was the same skirt. this is a ""go to"" skirt, comfy and sexy all in one! even wore it to the airport with a pair of boots and sweater....super comfortable and still looked nice! great purchase!",5
Very comfortable. super cute! my husband says it's the cutest bathing suit i've ever owned (and i've owned a lot)!!!!!,5
"I got this in black, size medium, my usual size. i am fairly ""curvy"" on top and found the shape in that area very flattering to my figure. it is shown as being rather drapey in front and indeed it does fit rather large at the bottom & indeed through the body itself. since i'm slim there, i will have to tailor it, am used to this considering i have to buy to fit my chest. but i'm keeping it for sure as i love the fabric and i think it will become a staple of my wardrobe. good job retailer!",5
"I ordered the gold in size xl. it fits true to size, matching the online photos. the color & details are prettier in person. such a comfortable tee. it's washed/dried well too. i hope they make more colors for this fall. it's been a great basic!",5
This jacket is perfect for fall! lightweight and easily worn over other tops or layers. looks great with jeans!,5
"These pants fit great, are soft, comfy, and flattering. i'm 5'7"" and the length is perfect in a medium. they wash well.",5
"I initially bought this dress to wear to an interview that required something casual, yet could be dressed up with interesting jewelry. although i ended up wearing another black dress, i kept this.  paired with interesting black booties and a great necklace, this dress is easy to wear  - and stylish. most importantly, comfortable. i could see myself wearing this on days that i feel inspired to dress up, but want to wear something that is not fussy. and, the pockets!",5
"This top is great to wear under a blazer when cool or alone on a warm day. i rated it as runs small only because if you are a little busty as i am, it is a little snug across the chest. otherwise fits great.",5
"This top is another winner from left of center! i love swing tops and this is just adorable. fitted through the sleeves and top portion, it drapes nicely in a very flattering way without looking ""maternity"". i love the rayon on the upper back which adds interest and a slight contrast. i purchased it in the gold color which is beautiful and the fabric is light and very comfortable. in my opinion it runs large. i'm usually a sp but ordered an xsp for a more fitted look but it still looked big for",5
"This is a great top and got compliments already...it does have a longer sleeve like the picture, but
really not bad. it's so comfortable and color is fabulous. great with any scarf too.",5
"Snap this one up but make sure you order a size larger than your normal size. it runs a full size too small. it sold out before and i was told it wasn't coming back in. i had purchased one previously in my regular size but it was too small. to my delight, it's back, and i've purchased one in the next size up. it's well made, can go from business to sport to casual.",5

"This jacket is a perfect, lightweight cover for dresses as shown online, but will also look great with jeans and tops. the embroidery looks amazing and is high quality. the tie in the back can make the shirt a little more form-fitted. while its a masculine style, its has feminine details and fit. this is my third hei hei jacket, the sizes between them are consistent (i'm 5'4'', 125lbs. 34c and i wear an xs in this jacket) - each one i've worn a million times!",5
"This great weekend staple is the perfect lightweight jacket. it has a roomy, comfortable fit but the drawstring helps you create a bit of a waist. got lots of compliments on the embroidery.",5
"This top is perfect! i'm 5'9"" and a medium build, and it's hard to find tops that have long enough sleeves. this is really long! i love the weight of the fabric - perfect under a coat and heavy enough for cool texas winter days. the fabric is really soft and the color is a blue-ish grey. the style is feminine but not too girlie. it's my new go to top!!",5
This top is awesome. i purchased the gold color in a small. fits perfectly and true to size; sleeves are nice and long. definitely recommend!,5
"I like this sweater very much. it's short but not too short, and soft but not fluffy. the design is a little interesting rather than plain and the colors (i ordered the tan) are great for me, a redhead. i'm 5'3"", 125 lbs and don't like clingy tops so i took a m and it's perfect. really cutewith jeans.",5
I would highly recommend this top. it is beautiful and it helps to hide problem areas. much prettier than the picture depicts. i am very happy with this purchase. can't wait to wear with black or white capris this summer.,5
"At 46 years old, i still like fun, hip, fashionable items, but i don't want to look like i raided my 21 year old daughter's closet. this jacket hits the mark perfectly. it looks great layered over a casual dress or with skinny jeans and a wedge. the embroidery and the back tie soften the masculine color and shape. i'll be wearing this often!",5
Very flattering on. fitted on top with a loose swingy bottom. like most retailer tops it does run a little big. i would size down if between sizes. the material does seem a little fragile so i'm not sure how it will hold up. i like the look/fit enough that i may get a 2nd color.,5
"The jeans look so different online! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut. the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches! also, i'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27, but the legs are super skinny. i'm so disappointed and i'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size. these look more like men's cut jeans.",1
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d) - 32-40 and the size 12 fit me perfectly with just a bra on underneath, when zipped up. i plan on wearing tank tops or thin t-shirts under it, and leaving it unzipped. i'm normally a size 10, but at retailer, i'm a 12 in their jackets.

2. thin with a thin lining, but stiff enough to hold its shape. the front zipper also helps give firmness to the front edge.

3. the fabric is white with lots of beige embroidery and lace holes.

4. i have a feeling thi",5
I love this jacket. i have worn it twice and gotten compliments both times. the details on the sleeves are so unique and interesting. it fits tts. i am typically an xl and i ordered that size- i can wear a long sleeve collared shirt underneath so it is perfect for me. the pictures on the website don't do it justice. it looks much nicer in person.,5
"These pants are super comfy and fit true to size. i went up to a size large because i wanted them extra roomy and longer. i'm 5'10"" and 140lbs and generally wear a size 6-8 in pants. i highly recommend them for stylish and comfy lounge pants!",5
I got the ivory. it's very cute under the split back cloth & stone button down denim in slightly oversized top (i wear sm but bought the med in the denim button down). this top in ivory runs true to size but the dark colors in sm fit like a medium. the top snags easily. it 's pricey but i love it.,5
Only one sleeve is folded twice and sewed. meh.,1
"I really love this top. it's cute, whimsical, and comfy. i received many compliments on it. it's a really good length and good quality. happy i purchased it, especially during the tag sale.",5
"Sleepwear is always hit or miss with me. i am 5' 8"" and curvy, and typically sleep pants hit right above my foot and aren't long enough. or they stretch out after a few wearings and look baggy or unflattering. however, this pair exceeded all my expectations! first, they are just plain pretty. the pattern and colors are lovely. the blue at the ankle is a cute touch. the fabric is soft and slightly drapey - but substantial enough for warmth and not see-through at all. i also like how the waist is",5
"This shirt is amazing. it's soft, comfortable. i can't speak yet as to how well it will hold up but i plan on wearing it a lot. the cut is great, the shirt flutters away from under the empire waist line and the nylon patch in the back, creating a flattering shape without clinging anywhere. the sleeves are nice, long, and fitted.

this shirt will work great as a winter/fall basic piece but the texture, color, and contrast detail in the back make it interesting on its own. very versatile.

I tried it on in the store & loved it but didn't purchase. then the retailer sale happened so i had to order it. it's lightweight and perfect for southern california. the embroidery adds funk and femininity. i'm 45 and feel like this works well for any age. i'm typically a large or 12 and the large fit perfect. i can't wait till the temps drop so i can wear it!!!,5
"Love these bottoms, cheekier than i thought but like them even more!",5
Super comfortable and on trend with the embroidery and beading - wore it day after i received to the airport over tee shirt & jeans and got compliments left and right - love it!!,5
I found this at my local retailer. it is a beautiful unique sweater. it fits nicely a bit longer in the back and a tad loose on the bottom. i've gotten loads of compliments as it's truly special. i'm not sure why it's not sold out yet!,5
"This cut and fit is so good. i sized up because my body just needs that with pullovers generally, and i was glad i did. it fits just right!",5
"This jacket is far more attractive than on the website. i would have passed this up had i not seen it in the store. the embroidered sleeve detail is intricate with raised cream colored stitching surrounded by small brass beads on a rich, olive green background. blue detail sets this off as a unique statement piece that will surely draw compliments. i am 5'1, 110 lbs. and the extra small regular fit fine. i considered a petite but the salesperson thought the longer length would look better so i w",5
A fabulous light weight jacket. love the detail and fit is perfect and comfortable. the jacket was not so interesting on the display table but once tried on it became mine and i suspect this is going to sell out. i really love the light color denim trim on the lapels. a keeper!  i purchased a medium and that is my standard size in retailer jackets.  for reference: 34 dd  and 145 pounds and 5'4 height.,5
"I want to hate these jeans because they are so expensive but every time i try these on they just look so cool. 
they seem to be handmade so the flowers are not in the same spot on each pair.",5
True to size and fits great. the sleeves are the perfect size and it's so versatile.,5
"True to form, this retailer sweater hits the mark! it's light weight, stylish, great for a shorter person like myself, and has cute detailing. the sleeves are little long, but i push them up anyway and the cream color i bought goes with everything. the xs size is more comfortable and flattering than the s if you are short. i would have bought the bluish gray color of this sweater, too, but already own a similarly shaded and textured sweater from retailer from last year...love that one,",5
Just purchased tonight and love i this little jacket.  the embroidery and beading down the sleeves is such an interesting touch yet neutral enough to wear with just about everything this fall.  runs tts.,5
"Bought this in dark grey, which has a lovely bluish hue. the fabric is soft & comfy and it has great lines for a knit fabric. very flattering! the sleeves are nice and long.",5
"I was leary about ordering this but absolutely loved it when it arrived!  i found out the front could be the back and the back could be the front - reversible, right?  and the styling of the shirt was very complimentary to my body.",5
"I love these jeans. i am usually a size 27 or 28 in boyfriend jeans and i kept the size 28. i chose the baggier fit. the size 27 did fit, but it was a more fitted look. so i guess i would say you could definitely go with your regular boyfriend size and pick the fit that you prefer. i really feel like this is a jean that you should try on before purchasing, but the availability of these makes it almost impossible. i literally stalked the site so i could purchase both sizes and choose the ones tha",5
"Although the weather is getting warm in ca, the gold color and cut of this shirt made me want to buy just one more long sleeved item--and it didn't disappoint! i'm actually looking forward to next winter so i can wear it again!",5
"Much to my surprise when i tried on this sweater i found that it was cut in a bell shape and not at all fitted or straight like in the photo. when i pulled it out of the package i thought i'd ordered the wrong size because the shoulders looked so narrow. but when i tried it on the shoulders fit perfectly, with beautiful detail and high quality material, but the sweater belling out to a very wide shape. it is very wide at the hip and looks out of proportion. it doesn't look anything like the phot",1
"Love this brand and i keep coming back. i don't have the most tone tush, but maaji always gives a cute little lift. i order a size up (usually a small so i order a medium).",5
"Yes, this is a bit expensive; however, it is made in the usa, so that is a very good thing. i appreciate having the opportunity to buy high quality, well-designed basic pieces that are simultaneously supporting my community and country. when you are considering this pretty top, please click on the gold so that you can see the detail. it is very well-made and flattering. i love how it has a slight shape at the back, very flattering and feminine. the feel and weight of the cotton is remarkably com",5
"I love these pants. only wish they i was a little taller, i'm 5'4"" and the small is a little long for me.",5
Colors are very vibrant! lays very nicely on the body.,5
"This is one of my favorite retailer dresses - it's flowy and makes me feel beautiful. i loved it so much that i bought it in two colors! it does run big, so i would size down but when you find your size, you'll love it!",5
"I really liked the dress on line, but, i didn't appreciate how lovely it was until i received it. it fit perfectly, and has a lovely flare at the hemline for a flirty feel. i wear it with taupe colored booties and it is perfect for work and afterwork.",5
"I'm in love with this dress! i have seen the chevron pattern of this dress on many women and i can honestly say that i haven't seen a body that it doesn't look good on. i am a busty girl and was afraid the shape of this dress would make me look as if i was expecting and much to my surprise it didn't at all. this is such a great transitional piece to have in your closet, i highly recommend it!",5
"I'm in love with this dress and first tried on the petite size in the store. if you don't have enormous shoulders (which i do) , i think the petite would fit someone in the 5'6"" range. what i'm trying to say is the dress is pretty long. the cut is beautiful and patterns perfectly complementary. i've been reading marie kondo's book and this one ""sparks joy""!",5
"I really love this top. normally i would not go for a lot of narrow stripes like this because i would think it is too busy, but this one is certainly the exception. both colors are fantastic and i think the design is alluring-not busy. i like that it buttons down which offers a lot of flexibility to display necklaces or have completely up to complete change the look. one of the things i absolutely love about this is that it has long sleeves. i think it is rare these days to find something that i",5
"I had this in my cart for ages, waiting for a sale and debating the dress in general. i am delighted as it did finally go on sale, i bought it, and it is fabulous!!! my measurements are 36/28/39, i wear a 34d bra, and the small fit perfectly. the only problem i have had with it is that the lining in the front shows about 3/8"" at the bottom of the dress once i have worn the dress. what seems to happen is that the dress creeps up due to its wrinkling, but the lining does not, hence the showing. i",5
"I was so happy to see this dress at one of my local retailer stores since i've had this in my basket since i first saw it, i tried it on in my usual size and it runs true to size in all areas. the length is as shown int he picture, i am 5'4"" and it hit me right above the knee. i am short waisted and the dress fit perfect, sat right above my waist and then lay just as shown. not too much material to make you look fuller in the hips, and also not too young looking. i am planning to wear it to",5
"This is a great summer dress. i bought this dress in both l and xl because this brand varies. i kept the l because the fit was better. the xl was wider and had larger armholes the fabric and colors are beautiful. lots of compliments, it is lined, highly recommend.",5
"I wanted to love this blouse so much. but try as i might, it just fit so oddly on me. i'm usually a petite s so i purchased the xs in brown. first. the color was more gray-brown but it was still ok. but second, the fit was off. maybe i just got a bad one, but the center of the blouse was so offset, that the slit in the front laid so far to the left and the v-neck was so low that you could see my bra - there was no adjusting i could do to fix it. the material has a lovely soft silky feel to it an",1
"I got 2 of these dresses, one in the navy with small flowers and the gray/yellow print. i am 51 and the navy looked a little old fashioned on me. i think if you are younger it would be super cute. the gray/yellow diagonal stripe is super cute! it's a more modern design in the fabric and i love it. it will be my favorite go to dress for the summer. i also think it will pack nicely for trips. i am 5'7"" and wear a small or medium with retailer clothes and i got a small in this dress and it's p",5
"This dress is beautiful - it is just as pretty as it looks in the picture, if not prettier. it is a great material, the colors are beautiful, and it is perfect to throw on in the summer. i highly recommend it.",5
Perfect summer dress! this is a must buy! it can be dressed up or down,5
"I am pretty obsessed with these and wish i could get them in many more patterns. the fit is ultra comfortable and true to size. the style allows you to put on a t-shirt, sweater, cardigan + t, whatever, and look completely put together. i got loads of compliments on them on the first day i wore them.",5
"This fell apart after wearing it once. for the price, it should hold up better. it's too delicate.",1
I wasn't sure about this top but i had a feeling i needed to at least try it on. it drapes so beautifully and the keyhole neck is a lovely little touch. i love the asymmetric hemline and the fabric is incredibly soft. as far as the fit goes i found that it did run slightly small.,5
Love this top! tried on a small in the store as it was the only size the had. the sales person ordered me a medium on line. i am wearing it tomorrow for my birthday! the stretch fabric is very flattering.,5
"I was skeptical when i saw it online. i was not sure about the white background. but it had good reviews and the cut seemed to be what i looked for so i gave it a try and ordered online. i ordered s and xs. i was really surprised how well this dress fits. i am 5.4 and about 126 lbs, pear shape. the fabric is thicker and lined but not too heavy. the cut is slimming, flattering and structured. i decided to keep the xs size. i hope i can find more dresses like this one in retailer.",5
"Very disappointed. ordered two sizes, the fraying of the embroidery was so bad on one of the dresses i wouldn't have worn it and the zipper was sticking. the second dress had fraying and loose threads as well and the seams at the shoulders were not properly sewn which made the lace at the neckline completely crooked. some of these issues would maybe be acceptable if the dress was under $100 but at $228 they are not. returning both sizes.",1
"I feel for the reviewer who didn't like this top. i tried on my normal size medium and it was not very flattering (just too short). when i sized up, everything changed. this top is amazing--super flattering and high quality. i love the material, v-cut, and subtle way the tassels hang. i wish they had more colors-i would buy them all! this top sold out in a day at my store. it's a winner-just make sure you size up.",5
"This dress is so flattering, i had wanted to try it on for awhile. when it hit sale w/ additional % off i headed to my local store. the dress fits like a dream, so darn cute for summer, in cali we have a lot of summer left. this dress pairs perfectly with the gretta espadrilles. my usual size small was perfect. hurry and get this perfect dress before it sells out!",5
Absolutely love everything about this dress. unlike many other dresses i've ordered from retailer it fits me in the chest (34c). it's very flattering. love the lace up front and the fabric is like a soft lined linen. can't wait to wear it. i got the s regular. if i was any bigger in the chest or through the ribs tho it would be too small. i almost ordered the medium and was certain i would end up needing a bigger size but the small turned out just right. like it was made for me,5
"Soft, silky, lined in silky natural fabric, hangs great without being weighty. extremely flattering on my xl short body. i'm petite, but for tunic dresses always order regular sizes, so they go just a hint over my knees--exactly what i need. lovely details: sequins and weighted tassels. highly recommend!",5
This is my very shirt i have ever bought at retailer! it's very comfortable and fashionable.,5
"I get so many compliments every time i wear this dress. friends, strangers, younger, older and even the pharmacist at my drugstore wanted to know where i bought the dress. it has a 70's vibe to it, fun and swingy. perfect for fall in florida with sandals or when it gets cooler, i think it will look great with leggings and boots. i purchased the orange and dark gray in a medium petite (i'm 5'4' and 135) and it hit just above my knee. my favorite dress right now!",5
"This dress is just what i was looking for. i ordered it in late summer. it was back ordered and i ended up wearing it on thanksgiving day! it's so comfortable, and just the right length. i wore it with leggings and boots, but it will be just as great with sandals in the spring.",5
"This is a beautiful dress. it has great detail and is well made. the tassles are very heavy which is kind of funny because the dress is light and airy. it is pretty, cute and sexy all in one dress!",5
Great tunic!  i get compliments every time i wear it. :),5
I absolutely love this dress. it's flattering and feminine. you will love it. it runs large so size down.,5
"Loved the dress on-line. ordered a petite small. fits perfectly. i am barely 5'5"" and carry my weight in hips and thighs. this fits perfectly without being too snug on the butt!! so, if you are a pear shape, get this dress!!",5
"Beautifully embroidered dress.  it's loose fitting, not meant to be tailor fitted, so it would run large to you if that's what you were expecting.  the colors are gorgeous and the skirt has a really beautiful flow.  if you are hoping for a fitted look, size down one size.  there is plenty of stretch to this dress and plenty of room in the bust and waist.  i generally go between 00p and 0p, and got this in a 0p (though either would work).  it comes to just above my knees at 5'2"", 110, 32-24.5-32.",5
"I saw this in the store and decided to try it on. it is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i didn't think that i would like it due to the sequins on the front. when i put it on, i didn't mind them at all. it really is a beautiful dress with beautiful colors. dry clean only is the only drawback to this one.",5
"Such a beautiful, flattering dress! i bought this to wear for our anniversary dinner and received so many compliments.",5
"I'm stunned by the bad reviews by others. i love this dress! it is an amazing, feminine, detailed, exceptional work of art, and lucky for me -- who usually takes 14s and 16s -- that it runs big. there is stretch to it, and it fits great! lucky, lucky me.",5
"Great quality and cut! they are so versatile, which i love! highly recommend these!",5
"This dress is beautiful. swingy and fun, and the floral pattern is just stunning for fall and winter. i am planning on wearing it with black tights and ankle booties. could be dressed up or down- very versitle. fits my tall curvy frame perfectly. love.",5
Saw this in the store and just had to have it. beautiful design. fits perfectly. looks nice with a belt as well.,5
"These literally are more comfortable than sweatpants. they are definitely ""relaxed"" and look a little baggier on than in the photo, but still cute and flattering.",5
"This dress is a great dress for spring and summer (and early fall) events. it's surprisingly light weight and comfortable. you can pair different shoes with the dress due to the various colors which makes it easy to dress up and down. i definitely recommend if you're looking for a fun, floral, feminine dress.",5
"Count me in as a five star lover of this dress! the details are so rich and interesting, so be prepared to get noticed when wearing. i'm happy to say that getting the size medium regular (instead of petite) was a good choice for my top heavy frame. the chest is fitted but not tight, the length is a not-too-short above knee, the tiered layers swing so nicely, and the beads/sequins add a touch is whimsy to the design. my one negative is the tassels at the neck tie--soo heavy cumbersome to style. o",5
"This dress is lovely.  it flows nicely and is extremely flattering.  also true to size.  unfortunately i do not care for a lot of glitter/sparkle, which this dress has going down the very front so it is going back.  wish i could pull off the glitter but can't.  i absolutely love this dress otherwise and very much recommend it.",5
Love this tunic...and so do others! so many compliments already!! i've worn it with skinny jeans as well as flowy black pants. it needs a cami underneath since it's sheer. i also like to wear it with my long retailer necklaces!,5
"If it's a knock off, its of the ""poise"" dress, and a pretty good one at that. this is a beautiful dress that took my breath away the moment i saw it. when i saw such a poor rating i just had to see why. the erin fetherston dress is over $100 more and they look just about the same. i'd rather have the $ and the look!",5
"I love this style and was pleasantly surprised that it fit my curvy shape well, despite it being a fairly straight shift style. it does wrinkel easily because of the linen fabric, but otherwise is really perfect! it is dressy enough for bridal showers or brunches but could also be worn casually.",5
"Very comfortable,  looks great on. like the color & fabric. something you can throw on & go",5
"Love this top! i'm 5' 118 lbs, purchased in a medium and plan on wearing it as a dress! it is so cute!",5
"I'm so glad to own this one. i just tried it today and fully satisfied as always with pilcro. true to size, perfect color.
high waisted and flare just right. can be paired with cropped top or peasant top. looking taller on this outfit!
best of all i got it on sale!",5
"The most disappointing thing about buying flare jeans when you're 5'4"" is taking them to the tailor to have a chunk of what makes them flares hacked off. not so with the petite 31"" inseam on these!!! love the perfect amount of stretch, the rise is high but not too high and the flare is perfect. definitely recommend.",5
"I was really excited for this top to arrive and was really disappointed once i tried it on. i am sure this is a gorgeous top on someone with a straighter or more slender frame. it is good quality and looks fine on the hanger. i think the color in the picture online accurately shows the color. ladies with hips or a booty, beware...this looked horrible on me! it clung to my butt and didn't hang nice and straight like it does in this picture. i expected the fabric to have a little give to it but it",1
I had this in my cart for a while online and ended up finding it in store. the medium fit good and looked great. i can't wait to wear it with a great pair of leggings. i did have to buy some static spray as it was sticking to my leggings i had on that day buying it.,5
"Love the pilcro brand, they are one of my favorites, even compared to other more expensive denim brands. i ordered my usual two sizes smaller and found they did not fit this time! i probably should have ordered one size smaller than my usual in this cut. sadly, i have to send these beauties back and hope for a pop-back.",5
"I ordered a pair online, they came today and i am in love! the fit is great, i love the high rise waist. i will have to hem the bottom, i am a tad short (5'3"") and it is rare that i don't have to hem my jeans. they make my legs look longer and are a very flattering fit. i am very pleased with my purchase.",5
"This coat is gorgeous. the minute i saw it online i ordered as fast as i can type!
when it arrived it exceeded my expectations in every way.
the lace detail is exquisite and the fit is so flattering.
i have the beatrice coat of last year and i so love it and this is equally beautiful.
a must for retailer shoppers. 
i ordered my usual size and it fits to perfection.",5
"Nice jeans, fit true to size and look as pictured. i recommended those to a friend and she bought and liked them as well.",5
"I love these jeans. the wash is nice enough for work. they fit well around the waist and have just the right mid-rise height, to make them stylish- not mom jeans at all. i am a pilcro convert. very comfortable too.",5
"I rarely even try on denim at retailer because i'm quite curvy and the styles, while cute on the models, rarely have fit me. not so with these jeans! they're my first pair of pilcros and a steal at the sale price! i'm 5'3"", 150lbs, 32d for reference and i purchased a regular 28, even though i'm often a 27 in my favorite long and lean jeans. they hug my butt and hips in a very sexy way, but not to the point of not being able to wear them at my office. i will need to get them hemmed, but not",5
"I was hesitant to order high rise pants, seems they only ever look good on a tall person. but these worked out perfect, i'm barely 5'6"", and the pants are just as long on me as the model in the picture, just barely brushing the floor when i'm in heels, though if i'm honest they do touch down a bit which will scuff them most likely, but to tailor 1/4 inch seems ridic. love them, super sexy, slimming, and elegant, the color is rich and the material is not too thick or thin, very comfortable stretc",5
"This top definitely looks better in person. i thought it looked pretty online, but when i tried it on, it looked even better! this top is on the longer side and fits like it looks on the model. the fabric is perfect in my opinion because i don't have to 1) dry clean it, 2) iron it, or 3) worry about it itching or bothering my skin. i am 5'8"", 140 lbs, and 34 a/b. i purchased a size xs and it drapes wonderfully. i love the crochet around the neckline, the 3/4 length sleeves, and the colors of the",5

yes, they are too long (i'm 5'4 1/2""# for flats, but look fantastic with heels #i need 2 1/2"" - 3"" to wear with these).

"Just got this dress in the mail yesterday and i love the style and fabric soooo much!!! the fabric looks kind of shiny in the photos so i wasn't quite sure, however in person it's a perfect blend that can easily be dressed up or down. sadly i cannot fully see how it looks on me because the bust of it is way too small. i normally wear a 0 or 2 in a dress and am a 32c but the inside panel that you cannot see in any of the photos is very fitted to the chest and i cannot even zip the size 2 over my",5
"I haven't worn jeans in a year because i felt uncomfortable and constrained. these are as soft as my leggings. they have so much stretch, you could do yoga in them. if you want the jean look w/o the stiffness/structure, get these. flattering to the booty too.",5
I kept going back to this sweater as this goes with so many different bottoms! thank you retailer! i ordered the petite version since i am not as tall as the model so the length is perfect! the speckles of gray are beautiful and would frame any complexion! the fit if flattering with straight pants or short skirts.,5
"I ordered the xxs p and it is almost big, so between true to size and big. it is both flattering and stretchy. the waist comes in nicely, the sleeves are not annoying, and the sparkle add to the lbd in my opinion. length was right above the knee.just. i am 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist for reference...",5

"I am on an retailer diet but i can't stop thinking about this top! tried it on with my sister when shopping and if only they'd had my size in stock i'd have been a goner for sure. it is super comfy -- the fabric is somehow both lightweight and structured. while i'm kind of sick of high/low, this one manages to execute in a really subtle way that just manages to hide the bum without being in your face. love the sparkle -- you could wear this to work then out on a date or all weekend long. so versat",5
"This tunic is a lighter weight knit that isn't bulky to wear under coats, etc. it has grey shades running through the natural color which gives the knit more depth. it has a flattering fit. i bought it in the petite size and the length is perfect. i like the way the knit pattern runs two different directions in the front. it adds more interest to the look.",5
"When i first saw this shirt in person i was shocked because the lines on it are sparkly and colorful.  now that i look closely at the shirt online i see that, but i did not expect it cause it wasn't as obvious in the online photos.  it is much more prominent in person.
i ordered it in my usual size and it fits perfectly - just like the model, definitely oversized but appropriately so.  the length was also great (i'm 5'8) which made me very happy.",5
I just received these denim joggers. this is my first pair of denim joggers and they are absolutely stunning. i like the decorative band. i do feel as these will be a staple in my wardrobe. the possibilities with these joggers are endless.,5
"This is one of the cutest jackets i have ever owned. nice soft material. i have a steamer so won't have to iron this, depends on how picky you'd be about that. great cut. ordered my normal size. sending another jacket back that luckily i hadn't worn yet. i know between the two, i will always pick this one. didn't find the sleeves too long which was good as no petite option. seriously so excited to wear this. :)",5
"Love everything about these! they are super fostering and comfy. i am a busy mom and need comfort. these are a great addition to my closet. super cute with booties, wedges and flats.",5
"They fit me great, are super comfortable. they are casual, yet also stylish thanks to details like the colorful waistband and the zippers on the side of the legs. they looks great and i think i can wear them for many occasions. i love them with booties :). i think they look better in person than online, too",5
"This fits like a regular top for me. i can take petite on top most of the time. i bought this in a medium regular and it fits like my regular high low tees or tops. i think it's so cute on. it's light weight enough for warmer weather. i'm going to love it this spring/summer and into fall with a jacket or cardigan. another plus is it doesn't gape at the armpit which i get sometimes with regular cuts. it's not so low cut on me either, but i have a 32f (37-38ish inches) bust so that may be why? it",5
"I am normally a pretty big fan of the moth brand, but i took a chance on this dress/tunic and i am so glad i did! i love love love this piece. it's soft, light weight material make t perfectly versatile so spring, winter and fall. it's so easy to throw on with a pair of leggings or skinny jeans and dress up or down with a scarf or necklace. i've already worn it several times and wearing it right now actually! it fits very true to size, i am 36d, 31"" waist and 5' 2"" so i ordered a large and it fi",5
"This hoodie has a great fit! it is slightly tapered in at the waist so it is not boxy. in fact, it is quite flattering. it has pockets and a cute rubber zipper pull. the hood is a nice size, not overwhelming to the back profile. i purchased the matching pants a few months ago but had not idea when i ordered this. now i have a super cute ""lounge at the lake"" ensemble.",5
I was immediately drawn to this stunning blouse ( in pink) in the store. it is a fabulous silk and velvet just in time for the holidays and beyond. in true floreat style it is well made and unique.  i'd say it fits tts to maybe slightly small if you want it to fit like it does on the model. i usually buy petite sizes when available but went with regular sizing as that is what was in the store and i liked the fit.,5
"In person this pattern is vibrant and lovely. i usually wear an xl in tops but in flowy ones like these i can size down to a l, which i did. the nice thing about the cut is it minimizes a large bust while maintaining a nice shape. it is a bit long which lengthens the torso if you are short like me. the bib portion is almost quilted and very substantial. all in all, a great purchase.",5
"I love the embroidery detailing on the top. i think this shirt looks better in person than online.

i'm an hourglass shape, and this loose style for shirts often tents out away from my chest, but this top drapes down nicely. however, loose shirts like this aren't my style, so i belt this at my waist, and it looks even better. the top flatters my broad shoulders (meaning that it doesn't make them look wider), and it hits below my hips (i'm 5'10""). i also appreciate that the armholes are small,",5
This top is just amazing. it does run large so size down but fit and feel is wonderful especially if you would like to hide some lumps and bumps this is the perfect top.,5
"Ok, this shirt is like my dream.  it's large, comfy but sexy with the back dip.  as a larger chested lady (32g), i really appreciate having a tee that i can easily throw on and look put together.  clearly, this is a larger, styled swing tee but it's one of my favorites.  paired with a cute pair of boots, and easily worn with a jacket.  it can tend to fall off the shoulders so i'd size down.  i'll probably pick up the grey too.",5
"I love this top. the material is soft but good quality and not flimsy. the cut is fitted and flattering. the color of the fabric is ivory, not bright white. the embroidery is a good quality and doesn't easily fray. the fit is true to size. i highly recommend this top. i wear it with jeans and it looks really cute, always get compliments. it's very comfortable too.",5
"This top is so lovely. the fabric is thick and soft, and the drape is phenomenal. i did size down based on reviews, i typically wear a large and the medium is perfect, nice and flowy and very flattering.",5
"This blouse is sumptuous! the fabric is soooo soft, embroidery beautiful, fit flattering. sadly i returned it due to the color. i mostly shop on-line due to time restriction, and the picture looks to be a winter white to me. it is a light yellow color, most pleasing with the cobalt embroidery. alas, any shade of yellow makes my skin look jaundice - so back it had to go.",5
The embroidery details on this top are beautiful. the material is soft and a really good quality. my first time wearing out and i received so many compliments! i love it!,5
"Love this dress, the colors are stunning, the make is beautiful...i don't know where to start. the body part is a nice neutral color, and has beautiful beading, my concerns is snagging since the fabric is so flowy and the beading pokes out sort of... i love that they used different patterns on the layers, the skirt bottom layer has cute polka dots that are translated on the sleeves (bottom of the sleeves). sleeves, are, by the way, fun and bubble-like. the cut of the dress is not following the b",5
"I ordered a size xl. it's flowy so it could be running larger but since the fit in the shoulders/neck/sleeves matches the model, i think it's true-to-size for the design. it is so comfortable. i love the softness of the material. the problem for me is the color. on my monitor, it looks like a light ivory or white. but, the embroidered lace bib portion is a darker ivory shade that doesn't work for my complexion so i'll be returning mine. everything is well-made though, especially the vintage-styl",5
"The floral pattern on this tank tranforms it to a beautiful piece.  i usually tend to avoid top with full pattern because it tends to look busy, but not with this top.  i'm usually wear s/m with retailer brand depending with the design.  this tank has loose bottom section, so the s is tts for me.",5
I purchased this top over the weekend and absolutely love it. i am currently 9 months pregnant (due in a week) and this top is perfect bc it has plenty of length. it is super soft and comfortable for the texas heat. i am 5'6'' usually 115 lbs currently closer to 140 lbs.,5
"Just got this in the mail today. very pretty, soft and comfortable. i could probably have sized down, but it fits fine. for reference, i'm 5'4"", 138 lbs and i got an xs. grab this while it's on sale!",5
"I'm not sure what cup size i am, 36b or 36c, but the medium fits perfect. material is soft and stretchy. i usually wear a medium size shirt. i definitely won't be wearing it out in public, but i like it a lot for at home wear. the matching underwear may run large. i'm usually one size larger in bottoms than in tops, but the medium worked for those too.",5
"This dress is stunning. it is beautifully made with laces and beading in a way that is art. it fits in a very flattering and comfortable way. i think is would flatter any body type. the details are captivating and it immediately grabs the spotlight when you walk into a room.
i ordered online and when it arrived i was stunned with it's exotic use of fabrics, textures.....a rare find and a must have.",5
"This top is beautiful on, it has very feminine detail and is very flattering. the first time i wore it i got 4 compliments on it. i would definitely recommend!",5
"I'm a teacher and am always looking for easy to wear pieces that will also work for my job. i also walk in to campus with my backpack, so i need something that looks good but is comfortable. 
this dress drapes beautifully, is really soft, and has a wide, flattering neckline. i'm short and chose the regular size instead of petite so that it would hit right at the knee. it's definitely on the generous side: i usually wear an s and i sized down to an xs.
i can definitely see getting a lot of wear",5
"This top is really nice and the fabric is more substantial than it looks in the photo. it has a great shape and is nicely made. i ordered an xs, which i nesrly always wear, but i measure 35"" in the bust and it fits well, but no extra room. i'm petite and it is not too oversized. really cute top and a great value.",5
"I agree with the other reviews, this top runs large so size down. with that being said, this is a beautiful top, love it!",5
This top is soft and comfortable without being some shapeless drag with too much fabric. i did size down as did the other woman in the store with me. i can see many more wears out of this top. wish it had been made in other colors or white would be beautiful!,5
"This top is beautifully constructed, fits true to size i ordered a medium - the armholes are nicely cut - not too loose will be able to wear with a racer back bra, accommodates my larger bust 34dd.",5
"This is a very pretty summer top. the detailing at the neckline adds interest, and the floral pattern is gorgeous! one note: in the picture, the top appears to have a white background, but it is actually more of an ivory/cream color. this is definitely a swing top style with a lot of room in the body. i am 5' 8"", 145, and normally wear a medium or 6 in retailer tops. i ordered a small in this top, and it fit great at the top but was almost too large in the body of the top. i am considering",5
"This top is a perfect example of why retailer is heaven. the attention to detail is stunning and it drapes beautifully. i am 5'6"" and 140lbs with an average build. an xs fits me perfectly. this top is very flowy. i could wear it until about six months into a pregnancy, yet it is flattering even though i am not currently adding to the human race. it's an investment, but it's high quality and worthy of the price tag.",5
The print is beautiful and the detail on the chest is so pretty. th fabric is a soft t-shirt martial. i ordered a medium and it fits like a large. it is supposed to be flowy and loose though. overall i feel beautiful in it. great for our hot humid charleston summers!,5
"I tried this one on twice before i committed to it, but i'm so glad i did!! this top has a lot of volume. it is fitted in the arms (but stretchy), has quite a large neckhole (but lays beautifully on my neck and shoulders), and has a lot of volume on bottom. what i love about it is the variance in length at the hem. it's long in the front and back, then comes up on the sides. this makes the top really feminine and lovely! it's the perfect top for women who carry weight in their belly or butt...i",5
"I tried this shirt on on a whim in my local store when i was there to shop the sale items an to my surprise, it was very flattering and comfortable. it had a unique fit and design; i tried on the black in an xs (my usual size) and surprisingly, i didn't find it to be too big at all. it fit just like it did on the model. you could almost wear it as a mini dress over leggings/shorts based on the length. like one of the previous reviewers, it would be great if it came in other colors. this top woul",5
"This is so beautiful! i loved it online, but it's even prettier in person. it's a little greener than it appears in the photo. the straps are actually a green rather than white. i'm 5' 6'' 123 lbs and the xs fits perfectly. worth the money!",5
"Love this shirt so much. it is comfortable and a beautiful print. i sized down because it is very flowy! it is ivory instead of white, but still looks beautiful. one of my favorite tops.",5
"This is the reason i doggedly fight for items at retailer as there are often maybe 6 made in my xxsp.

you really have to see this in person. even the slip could be worn as a chemise alone with the double layer and dots. the colors are gorgeous. i wanted this to try with my burgundy velvet blazer (and it works withe the copper color - too). 

the dress is really a swing shape - not close fitting - no ""waistline"" so it is very comfortable. the sleeves are fitted, but stretchy so should not be a",5
"The colors on this blouse are beautiful and even more vibrant in person. i love that the blouse is lightweight, perfect to wear to any holiday gathering!",5
"I have always had a thing for velvet, and velvet pants are hard to come by so i was so pleased to see these and i rushed to order a pair in the dark turquoise. they are beautiful; exactly as pictured, but a bit longer in length on me. i am 5'3"". they can be dressed up, but what is so fun about them is that they can easily be dressed down as well. i am wearing them with a heather-grey t-shirt. they also pair well with the metallic linen tees. my one and only criticism is that they are a bit wide",5
"I love this cardigan! its fit, however, really depends a lot on an individual's height and build. i am about 150 lbs. i have slim arms and am larger in the chest. my typical size in retailer clothing is m. having said that, i found that in this top a s fit best. it made a difference with how the pockets and lapels lay. the pants you wear may affect the look when you snap it closed. wearing leggings or slim pants (ex. pilcro cords) gave a much more flattering look to my backside. jeans...not so muc",5
This is one of my favorite retailer dresses of all time. it is soo much better in person and on than the stock photos. very romantic and fun.,5
"This is figure featuring without being too tight. it fits exactly like the picture. it is a bit pricey, but can be dressed up or dressed down and is perfect for hot summer days as well as worn with a cardigan. i love it!",5
"So soft and comfy.  fits great, love the length.  i am sure it will get much wear, great addition to my wardrobe.",5
"I love this dress! there are so many different looks you can get just by adjusting the straps or shoulders. the material is lightweight and flows with every turn. i ordered my usual size 10 and it fits perfectly. i did need a little assistance in getting the side zip to go up, but once it was on i didn't want to take it off.",5
"This is the softest cardigan i own. perfect for lounging, going to / from yoga or dressing it up with a statement piece or a scarf. i've worn it buttoned or open, and receive many compliments. i have it hanging on the inside of my closet door because i wear it more than anything else at the moment : )",5
"Love wearing these, i see them getting a lot of wear in the winter",5
"I don't have anything like it in my closet, really excited to wear it",5
"I love this dress, it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me. i am not the tallest person, 5'4"" but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing. perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me, but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast. it's just something to be aware of. i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess.",5
I was looking for a new pair of pajama pants/around-the-house pants/occasional-quick-errand pants to replace a pair that i bought from retailer six years ago and i fell in love with the look of these.they are truly comfy and are flattering on. the lace adds a nice feminine touch that makes me feel pretty even on my laziest days. i'm hoping these will last me another six years.,5
"I love this dress. my favorite retailer purchase in years. it is perfect. looks great- no need for ironing and is really sexy for the length and amount of material. i would buy it 10 more times if i could. 

yes!",5
"Just wanted to add my comments to the review that stated these pants ran small in the waist.  i sized up because of that review and ordered an extra large as i wanted these to be loose and comfortable. i typically am a m/l in retailer.  the xl is actually a little big but not enough that i need to return them. if you order these in a fit that is fairly loose, these are not see through at all. (i ordered the color shown on the model) i am about 5 feet 4 so the pants are not as cropped on me .",5
Classy pants that can look casual or sophisticated. my husband loves them on me. for a dinner out i dressed them up with a top from retailer. i think these will be a must on my trip to florida this winter since the pants will look great with a t.,5
"I had high hopes with the other good reviews, but you just don't know how amazing this is until you put it on! just so soft and cozy! i am so excited for more saturday/sunday products at retailer!",5
"I bought this dress online last week (in large part based on all the positive reviews), then i saw it in the store. i didn't try it on because it was already on the way to me and i had ordered a petite anyway and the store didn't carry petites. i have to say when i saw it hanging in the store i was disappointed! for some reason i didn't realize it was a sweater dress and it looked frumpy on the hanger. so i had resigned myself to returning it once i received it. well it came today and i figured",5
Very cute and comfortable dress. run true to size. i usually wear a 4 and the s fits nicely. stretchy and soft!,5
"This is a beautiful cardigan. its effortless, lightweight, with some cool detail to keep that low key look extra stylish. the moss color is very subtle with a small lined print. i wanted to love this...the detail, the length, the weight and the color are all so dreamy...but for me, the arms were super tight. normally i'm a l or xl in all retailer tops and sweaters...and i do have larger arms which is always a struggle for me when shopping. i couldn't even get the cardigan on my arms. there is no s",5
Love this cardigan! i've been searching for a comfortable lounge type of sweater and this is perfect. the sleeves are a bit tighter than the body. but i would wear it over a tank top so it is comfortable. i am 125 lb and 5'5' and i ordered my usual m.,5
"Let me just say that this material is awesome!!! when i first took it out of the packaging i was afraid that the top was too thick of a material but after wearing it around the house it seems light enough. (i live in a warm area). i will say that i find the top to be a bit larger. i ordered a medium in fear that the small would be too small on the bottom. i could have taken the small in the top---even though it is meant to be baggy 

 the bottoms on the medium fit me great- they shorts don't b",5
I was excited to order this dress based on the reviews. it was better than i expected. the fit is perfect and one of the most comfortable dresses i own. the fit is flattering and i will get plenty of use out of this one!,5
"When i first saw this online, i knew i had to have it. so, when dresses were 25% off, i grabbed the deal! it's perfect. it's super soft and an appropriate length. i love the bell sleeves-they're ultra feminine and slightly trendy, but not too much! i definitely recommend this dress! reference: 5'7, 140ish lbs--size 27 in jeans, xs/s/4 in tops and dresses and the small fit me better than the xs.",5
"I know i will be wearing this a lot! i wore it on tuesday for work with some dressier pants and opened, i wore it on sat and sun for long walks :) great piece",5
"This is a lovely dress and exceeded all of my expectations. very unique and well-made. swing dresses can be a hit or miss, sometimes, but this one is perfect. couldn't be happier!",5
"I love the cardigan. it's super comfy and long enough to cover my behind. the pink and white stripe lining adds a softer touch. it's a little tight in the arms. i'm right between a small and medium, i wish i would have ordered the medium.",5
Just got this yesterday and i'm wearing it today! super comfy for running errands with the kids and going to and from the gym...or just to lounge around the house. i go between a m and l and went with a m since its flowy and it fits great.,5
"Everyone should have this blouse, amazing! simply love it! it does run large, so purchase down 1-2 sizes.",5
This shirt fits really well- i ordered a size small and it's definitely a bit form fitting. i was a little bit hesitant to purchase this at first- for a tshirt it's a pretty hefty price. but the quality and cut are really quite attractive and worth every penny.,5
Confortable and looks great how ever you wear it.,5
"This dress looked adorable online, but unfortunately, it's not flattering at all, and it's completely see-through. completely. the material is so thin that i can't imagine it would hold up very well over time. this one is definitely going back.",1
"Great for work, great for play. i love this shirt. perfect length for tuck in or not.",5
"This top may be labeled as a part of a sleep set but i threw a cami under it, styled it with skinny jeans and a top knot and this became a very effortless/chic so cal look. love that pop of hot pink too! i went up a size for a little extra wiggle room across my shoulders. overall this is a great summer top!",5
"As another reviewer noted, the upper portion (back, chest, shoulders, etc.) fit nicely. however, the body of the dress was enormous and did, indeed, make me look much heavier throughout the middle. back to the store it goes.",1
"I am beyond pleased with this dress. photos do not do it justice and no, it does not look like a gown. it is comfortable, forgiving, and will be a staple for years to come. i am 5' 11"" and the large worked perfectly for me in length and size. this is my first maxi dress and i'm thrilled. do not miss this piece, it is special!",5
"Sometimes you have those days where you feel overweight and unattractive. this shirt is perfect for that. it has a chic cut, and it doesn't look like you are having an off day at all. so cute. and i really like the length as well. i usually wait until items go on sale, but this i had to buy right away.",5
I saw this dress in the window in the santa barbara store and fell in love with it! it is described as a robe in one post i saw but i think it looks so much more like a great fall/winter maxi. in the window display it was paired with a cognac leather belt which made it look even better.,5
"The pictures of this dress do not do it justice. i bought it, cut the sleeves off to be even with the waist line and belted (with a slim belt ) and it is perfect! it actually becomes a very sexy dress, it is a true wrap with a deep v and the vent in the back, i mean this dress paid dividends at the end of the night (to be very honest)!

wearing this to south beach, it will be perfect with strappy, high heels.",5
I ordered christmas presents online this year. they arrived very quickly and were well received! they are ferry pretty!!! i will order online again!!!,5
"This unit is gorgeous as a dress or as a top with a cami, skinny jeans and boots. i'm wearing it to my cousins wedding and obsessed. i bought a long delicate necklace at retailer with a gold pendant and it falls perfectly with the neckline. my only slightly negative comment is about the quality. the material is beautiful but i noticed the elastic coming through the ends of the waistband where it snaps shut. still keeping it though!",5
I bought this in store on sale and absolutely love it.,5
"As of late, it's been difficult for me to find clothing at retailer that fit's true-to-size. i'm 5'2"" and 107 lbs. and i've had to return several pieces because they were too big on me. this versatile piece fits true-to-size. i purchased an xsp. like the previous reviewer, i've tried this with a couple of different long-sleeve shirt and tights combinations. i think this will work in the spring and fall, too as the material is in between heavy and light/airy. great for work.",5
"Such a beautiful top, i understand why other reviews suggested wearing it out. personal i love pretty sleepwear, so i will be wearing this and matching shorts to bed. i ordered a small in both and they seem to run true to size. i am 130lbs and 5'5"". my regular size is small or a size 4. i love the embroidery and the pink!",5
"Well made embroidery, held up well in the wash. love the unique green color pattern! comfortable.  got a size 4(115#, 5'2"", 34b).",5
"I absolutely love this shirt! i saw it in the retailer store and immediately knew i had to have it. all they had in stock was a size 2 and a size 8. i'm usually a 4-6 in button-up shirts, but i tried the 2 anyway and found it to be quite generously sized. i have a 32dd bust, so button-up shirts rarely fit me properly. this one was big enough to be comfortable worn out or tucked in, and was loose-fitting without being sloppy. when i discovered that it came in petite sizes, i asked the so to order t",5
"This ribbed henley is incredibly soft. you'll love the way it feels, but it does run a little small so i'd recommend getting one size up if you don't want it to be too form fitting.",5
I was so excited to get this dress since it look so pretty on line but unfortunately the it was horrendous on. the model must have the dress tailored because it looks like a huge tent on me. it was very wide bust down and made me look 30 lbs heavier. i'm 5'4 and 125 lbs- ordered extra small and it fits bust up and arms so i say it's tts up top.,1
"The pictures online do not do this justice. i did not even recognize it as the same dress at first. i went a size down and that way it flatters my curves beautifully instead of looking like a robe. it can actually be worn 3 ways- i like closing the closest snap(there's two) in the middle with a skinny belt over it, and a slip dress underneath. this way, the dress has a deep v neck and opens out in front when walking. think 1940's glam. it can also be fully closed like in the picture, or left ope",5
Like the color and the dotted fabric. the length is good. the fabric on the back is a nice touch. fits well and hangs well.,5
"I bought this blouse at the store today and i love it! they stylist brought it for me to try on with the green chinos and it was perfect. it will go with jeans or dark pants as well. very unique and flattering! i got a size 2. i'm 5'7'"" and 130 pounds.",5
"Dress is very flattering on, not tent-like at all!",5
This is my new favorite shirt. i'm actually wearing it today! i had to order another in white too. grab it while you can!,5
"This is a basic henley, and it is made well; a wardrobe staple, for sure. the cut is flattering, and the material is soft. i ordered the small, which is tight fitting. i'm a 34 c for reference.",5
"This blouse is easily one of the nicest i have bought in recent times. the quality is excellent, the design demonstrates that design and nature are extremely compatible. i have worn this blouse with jeans and in a more formal situation and with a little more jewelry, the blouse fits in perfectly anywhere. i highly recommend it.",5
"This white shirt is a perfect canvas. i can dress it up with a scarf for work or wear it with my favorite jeans. it's perfect for all body shapes with the a-line. i love how comfortable this shirt feels. i like wearing this shirt with my black knit pants, and my retailers braided collar vest.",5
The shirt is very big. it would be cute as a maternity shirt.,1
I ordered this in gray and in white. these are not your mothers' slips. they are comfy and soft. i have worn the white under a shorter dress on a day when i wanted more coverage but didn't want to go for full on tights or leggings. i liked the effect of the slip being longer than the dress. the gray may even be opaque enough to stand (almost) on it's own. very happy with these.,5
"I'd seen this in the store pre-sale and was delighted to see it on sale. i'm 5'4"", 125 lbs and prefer a looser fit, so went with the medium, as i expect that it may shrink a bit. but i appreciated the creative take on a classic look, good quality of the fabric, and this will go with everything in the summer. or even beforehand -- with a cardigan.",5
"This lounge robe is the most fantastic, dramatic and comfortable wrap dress!  to the reviewers who posted pictures--you styled this to perfection.   a slip dress underneath is a must have since the opening basically unsecured.  i purchased the medium petite and i am 5'3"" 36dd and 140#.",5
"Stunning cardigan--i love it :) they only had a size l on sale so i purchased--i'm so glad i did. could have gone with a m though; maybe even a s, but that would be cutting it, especially since i'm 5ft 11in, 133lbs. compliments keep coming and such a great piece to have in my closet.",5
"I could live in this top: it's versatile enough to be dressed up or down or worn as a bottom layer; the color offerings are basic enough to match anything; and it's comfortable enough to wear around the clock. note that it runs small. i had to size up to a medium, even though 80% of everything else i wear is size small.",5
"I thought these pants had a great fit and the color is fabulous, i would have preferred a 30 inch inseam, but 31 is by far better than 34, that many designer jeans at department stores run.",5
"This is a lovely and unique blouse. it can be worn with jeans, shorts or a skirt. such a beautiful addition to anyone's wardrobe!",5
"Got this to wear on a beach vacation later in august. i was hesitant to purchase what is essentially a light weight cover up at this price, but is is really cute. the only problem i have with it is the slits on the sides are a bit high up. it is a good color and feels very nice. i will wear this on tropical vacations and running about since it is so hot! i bought the medium and it is a perfect fit and comes to my knee in the front. for reference i am 5'8' and 160#.",5
"Good quality; casual feel good dress. it can be worn as dress, or as tunic over the pants.",5
"This was long on me (i'm 5'1"") but it could easily be cinched up using the drawstring waist. very soft material, this will be a super comfy dress in hot weather. didn't seem too see-through.",5
The fit is true to size. the quality is nice. i am happy to having this basic wardrobe staple added to my closet!,5
This dress fits wonderfully. i can wear it causally or dress it up if i want to. great deal as well.,5
"I love these jeans. the fabric is super, super soft with good stretch and give, however they don't loose their shape either. they are mid-rise but a touch higher in the back so you never give anyone an unwanted show when you bend over. my only complaint - and this is just personal preference - is that the back pockets are kind of small. but the comfort outweighs any slight beef i have. for reference, i am 5'4"" and wear size 25. comfy, go-to's.",5
"This is a beautiful piece--and a really great deal on sale. it is sheer, but with a simple slip underneath it will work well for a comfortable but special-looking summer outfit!",5
I liked this online but loved it when i received it in the mail. i normally wear a m/l and the medium fit perfect. it is gorgeous and flattering with a tie at the waist. the bottom is flowy. i knew it would be sheer from the reviews so that wasn't a surprise but i really wish it came lined. no one wants to wear a slip to the beach and i feel it's too nice for a cover up.,5
"I am happy with my decision to buy this dress! it's casual, comfortable and my favorite color, too. this product is true to size, color and the material feels great.",5
"I bought this dress in both colors. it has an easy fit, is very comfortable and works well for a day dress, running errands, play time, and general casual. i am small framed and somewhat slender. i ordered the xs. the fit is easy loose, the fabric just right for the type of dress, like a favorite summer sweatshirt! i wish it came in other colors",5
I love how comfortable this fits and the fantastic pops of color. goes with just about every slip and tank dress i own! a perfect lightweight dress or layering vest with my hot weather wardrobe. can't wait to take this with me on vacation!,5
"When i saw this tunic dress, i knew immediately that i would wear it and it would become a favorite of mine. the cut is unique and it is versatile enough to mix and match with many different things. it is also very comfortable, true to size and very good quality material. i highly recommend.",5
"This tank is so light and made with great fabric. i bought this to wear over pants - black jeans, classic denim, this fall, maybe with a jacket over. 
i purchased a size medium, and it is loose and comfortable.",5
"These are perfect for pulling off a finished look, proper enough for teaching in yet fun enough for going out afterwards or just running errands. the polyester material is substantial, lined and easy care. the pockets lay flat but may not be very useful since the skort is pretty fitted. i plan on wearing these a lot this year!!",5
"I'm 5'3 and ordered the small. as soon as i saw it in person, i knew it was an item to return. the material is too transparent, and designed to wear with undergarments or swim gear that you want people to see. it was way too long for me. i think it would work for a taller person. i just didn't feel it was worth the money for the quality and transparency.",1
"This is the most comfortable beautiful dress/cover up. i can't believe the sale price. when i ordered, my reg m was not available so i ordered a small. it fits except the top button (36c). i just called and got a m since there was one available today online. hoping it ships! so impressed with this! i'll wear in summer and spring with a white slip underneath.",5
"This is a beautiful dress. it's a great weight, unique pattern, and has gorgeous colors. it's fairly forgiving because of the heavy fabric but may run small on bottom. i am a 10 or 12 in pants, 10 dress right now and i bought the 12. i am 5'8"" and 175 lbs, and 36c - also in the last stretch of a weight loss journey so if that helps anyone choose sizing... also i have to buy long or tall pants and this dress was not too short and did not show my smooth wear underneath. i love it and bought it at",5
"I tried this on in the store and immediately loved it!  it is ""diaphanous,"" but that is the intended look.  the dress is meant to be a cool, breezy, cover-up.  the design would have been slightly improved with slight tapering at the waist and sleeves, but not everyone can carry a fuller dress to begin with.  anyway, i purchased so many things that day that i had to narrow my picks down a bit.  i left this dress behind, but kept thinking about how very pretty it was.  when retailer offered an addit",5
"Comfortable and loose fitting- perfect for summer weekends when you just want an easy dress to throw on. can go from home to running errands to going out for lunch. good color, too!",5
"This top looked so cute on! i loved the color and the way it looked on my body. as cute as this looked tied, it could also be worn open as well with a tank top. loved it!",5
Loved this sweater wrap and bought it in both colors. very light weight and i will get lots of use out of this. i wish retailer would have more pieces like this. a+,5
"This does run a little large, but it's light and flattering for me. the material is a very light/thin chambray, but it's also lined.",5
"Bought this on a whim, cocoon sweaters usually do not work for me. this cardigan is very cute, more of a dark gray. if it they carry again, grab it!",5
"I think this fits to true to size. i am 5""2 and 107 lbs. i always wear a xs. it was a tiny bit tight in the bust if i wore a big padded bra (34b). if i wore a normal very little padding bra, it did not pull much across the bust.",5
"I really like this top! excellent over a casual dress!! perfect for spring, summer and fall!",5
"Love this little number. very flattering, warm, and soft. color goes with everything, i tried it on with a slip dress, and it added class and warmth... big button details are fun well-made and beautiful cut. i ordered xxs petite, and it fit like a glove, with room for something underneath if needed. i also ordered te xs petite, as my stylist was afraid xxs would be small, but will keep xxs p after actually trying it on.

This is a beautiful dress. the embroidery is really lovely in person. i find that this brand runs a bit small usually. i am usually an 8 but had to go up to a 10 to fit my hips. i am a little bit pear shaped so that might be why.,5
"This is an exceptionally soft and high quality coverup. i always look for a coverup that could double as a dress so that i can walk into a restaurant without feeling underdressed. i bought the white -- i always buy white it seems, but loved it so much, i came back for the blue. get this and live effortlessly this summer.",5
"The softest cotton gauze but, not see through. relaxed but, the sleeves & neckline make it flattering. a gorgeous blue in person. so in love with this dress, going back for it in white!",5
"This is one of my favorite pieces. simple, classy, and cozy!",5
"I thought this dress would be a cute beach cover up so i was excited to order it but i was very disappointed. i am 5'7 and i usually wear a size small top and 4 dress so i ordered a small in this dress but it was huge!! i understand that it is not meant to be form fitting and i wasn't expecting it to be but when i tried this on i felt like i was wearing a potato sack. i feel like an extra small would have been just as bad. i was so upset. it also has thin silver lines through it which, for me, m",1
"Comfortable and flows well, does run large, order one size smaller.",5
"This is truly a lovely dress. the colors are beautiful and i love the contrasting but complimentary fabrics which add interest to an already elegant dress. the material is substantial without being stiff so that it flows gracefully and it flatters the figure.
in my opinion if fits true to size, i'm 32b, 5' and 103lbs and i got it in a 2p which is the size i normally get in dresses. it is slightly more loose than other retailer dresses in the same size but it still follows your curves without being",5
"Love this versatile cardigan, have both blue & orange colors & they're beautiful. it's light weight yet cozy. true to size but the sleeves are a little snug so if you like roomier sleeves size up.",5
"I love ag stevie cords! i'm 5'4 and pear-shaped and the 26p fit great, the length and mid-rise are perfect! very comfortable and can be dressed up for casual work environment or down for weekend. the material is a bit thinner and not as soft as versions from previous years but still very nice and perhaps more versatile. wish petite had more color options.",5
"I love it. perfect, body hugging, just right length and great fabric colors. this shift fits just above knee and follows every curve. it is, however, unforgiving-there is no room in this to cover bumps or bulges; it is sleek and so figure-flattering. i am 140 lbs, 5'5 tall and 34d and it fits perfectly. one more pound and it wouldn't have zipped! i got a size 6 (my usual)!but too tight had to size up to 8. if you are on the fence, go up a size. i can't, however, imagine wearing this sleeveless a",5
Easy to take this dress from casual to dressy! super comfortable and cute!,5
"This cardigan is light weight and can be used for all seasons. additionally, you can wear it tied in the front or down for a cascade look. can be worn for the office or with jeans. love this little good for everything closet staple!",5
"These pants were wonderful...for 2 seasons. yes, for almost $200 a pop they don't even last a full year! loved them so much, i bit the bullet & bought 4 pair. all 4 started to rip in the same spot! i tried to contact ag directly & they do not back up their products after 30 days. fortunately, retailer was wonderful (as always!) i will buy pilcro from now on - much better product for the money.",1
"Love this dress! it is tighter in the chest area than maybe expected, but not unwearable, though i am smaller chested. it will be great for hot summer days as it has a light lining.",5
"I typically wear xs or s, or zeros but i got this in a m.  it doesn't look big, it looks like a regular fit to me i think a small or xs would have looked and felt small.  it's soft beautiful and warm.  the hood is so cute.  the detail is just so good.  i love it over top of 2 long sleeve blouses i got there and one of the cloth and stone button downs.",5
"So.. i saw this dress like a month ago and i fell in love. utter i-have-to-have-it love. before dropping $200 superfast, i gave myself some time to think it over. well, of course i decided to order it, and of course my size was sold out. most of the sizes were sold out, actually. they did have a petite left, so after i dried my eyes, i decided to wing it. the petite actually fit. the mid section is a little snugger than i am normally comfortable with (although the top is so structured that it ac",5
"Very cute, and well made. fits true to size.",5
"I was on the fence about this cardigan. once i got it in the mail, it's cute! it will go great with a long tank or longer t-shirt. worth the sale price! i ordered a small and is true to size.",5
"Really like this top. fun flair, nice quality shirt. great for dressing up with skirt and also would be perfect with boots for the rodeo. i paired it with a skirt and boots for church. wore white cami under to emphasize lace details. super cute. tried 8 and 8p. thought petite was too short in length on me (5'4""). will send petite back.",5
"I love this top, it is a very soft material and it looks very classy.. i have worn it with a skirt for work and skinny jeans. i have a bigger bust and i wear a small, it is true to size. very classy!!",5
"This dress is beautiful and so striking in it's unique design. i ordered a 4, as that is what i usually wear. about halfway up my body i knew it was not even going to zip! i did not even try. i love the fabric and colors so much though that i am going to try a 6. here's hoping it works!",5
"This dress is gorgeous, well made, lined, and tts. i get compliments each time i wear it and find it unique yet classy and appropriate for work. unlike some of the maeve tops i have purchased this year, it does not run big, and if you are banking on a little stretch, i would order the next size up. you won't be disappointed!",5
"This dress is fabulous with attention to most details. 5'4"" 103 lbs the 00 fits perfectly. overall fit is excellent, sleek, but not form fitting so very appropriate for work. length is also great, another plus.for work, many times the dresses are just a tad short, but this is great. arm holes are also great, not overly long as they often are. very nicely lined, substantial fabric. the only lack of attention to detail is they did not include the bra strap holders. why can't more dresses be made t",5
"This dress is gourgeous, will be able to wear year round.
just add a cardigan or blazer.
the only fault i find in it is the waist band is a bit wide.
however i have a hour glass shape, so my waist is very small",5
"I love the black and pale pink of this dress, the contrasting fabrics and the embroidery. my favorite kind of dress, creative and a little edgy, but elegant and can be dressed for the office too. ordered a size up from my usual size because i tried the previous dress in this style and it was a bit snug. the size up was a good decision, fits in the shoulders and waist better. the fabrics are nice and the finishing on the dress is well done. the mesh in the bodice is a little delicate and i will h",5
"I love this top. it is very comfortable and great to throw on with a tank and jeans for the weekend. i am curvy, and the drape of the top works well on my frame. i could see using it as a gym coverup as shown, but i like the top too much to get sweat on it :)",5
Great fit and style. i got the navy and the color is beautiful.,5
I was looking for something to wear over a spirit football shirt and this was the perfect piece. it's light weight and the material is super soft. you can wear it tied or untied.,5
I bought these cords in another color last year and they are my favorite pants. they are so comfy and keep their shape very well. when i saw they were back i had to buy another pair. i purchased navy and the color is beautiful.,5
"This dress is everything everyone said it was in the reviews. so cute and beautifully made. fully lined.
i felt it ran a bit small as i had to return it for the next size up, more so in the bust area. but the fit and length was perfect in the size 6. 5""10, 125lbs. i will say that all the raving reviews made me purchase
the dress without hesitation and i'm sure glad i did!",5
"This dress is everything i love about retailer. a never-could-have-guessed-it, feminine, textured twist on a classic. it's beautiful, it's comfortable. the cut is true to size (for me) and figure flattering.",5
"The patters/colors on this dress are much more stunning in person. it is lined and feels very well made. the pockets don't add bulk to the hip area as many times they do, which is great. the fit can be tricky if you have any semblance of curves. if you can, try this one on in a store before buying. for reference: i am 5'7"", have broad shoulders, am pear shaped (i have hips and a good sized rear end), 34b bust, weigh 145 lbs., and generally wear a size 6 or 8 for tops and bottoms. the size 8 fit",5
"I really liked this little cardigan. so simple, light weight, and comfy. i have grabbed it and put it on 3 times the first week i got it.",5
The material is so soft and the design makes it a little more fancy so you can dress this tank up or down. its definitely an instant favorite. and the color blue is a beautiful rich blue,5
"Awesome light shrug. goes with so many out fits, over tees and dresses. tts. get one! orange color is a pretty neutral.",5
"Love the pilcro brand! size down!! super soft, well fitting, great length. great darker color for fall. awesome rise. not too high, not too low. will be grabbing these a ton this fall.",5
"This is ruching done right! i tried this dress on and the two other women who saw me in it went to try it on as well.

it is fitted, but comfortable and because it is well cut the ruching hides a multitude of sins to leave you looking sleek and curvy in all the right places. it is also a versatile layering piece and would look great with almost anything. so unless this particular color is your nemesis, this dress is a winner!",5
"How could this not be flattering to every figure? bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections (i know, i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now). this, paired with a darker color (and not black, yay!) makes for a perfect combination in a dress. i love that this is a deep purple, it is a dark color which is slimming, but in addition it has more appeal being colored. and it is so versatile! wear it along or with a cardigan/jacket on top. heels or boo",5
This looks just like the picture. it's soft and very comfortable - looks great with skinny jeans and boots. love it!,5
This is a tts cami that should be a staple in everyone's closet. great for layering.,5

"These jeans are so comfortable and do not stretch out enough to size down, in my opinion. right when i put them on i could tell they fit perfectly. i have been buying pilcros for several years and have not been happy with the stet ankle jeans from the last 2 yrs because although they were very flattering when you first put them on, they stretched out so much it was annoying. 
these script jeans are amazing, flattering and are a nice lightweight denim. i wore them a few times before washing and",5
"Couldn't resist this jacket! it's perfect for business casual dress code, for staying warm in air-conditioned offices and goes with many colors and styles.

"Love, love, love this shirt! much like last year's bordeaux shirt in this style, it's very soft, very flattering, and very comfortable. fits tts, and the fabric is a very soft, stretchy cotton, yet not too clingy around the mid section (it has a nice, flowy fit#. it washes great, doesn't pill #again, the fabric is fantastic), and holds up really well. i bought the black with white stripes this year, but i'm tempted to get every color. it's great for layering too since the fabric is nice and thin",5
"I have not written a review for an retailer item in a while. i have been shopping at retailer for over ten years. in the past two years the clothing i have purchased has been disappointing in style and quality. but not this little pilcro jacket. great quality, perfectly proportioned, great understated details. many thanks retailer for restoring my faith.",5
"Pretty much awesome... i tried it on in regualr size jsut to see, and i could almost get away with it... too bad i dind't try it on before hte 25% of f dresses... (also, i don't have an occasion to wear this).

length is midi, but since it is gathered, i could pull it up a little so it falls in the right spot on me.

color is very nice, overall sexy dress.

material is soft and comfortable, nothing wrong except i missed out on the sale! :-)",5
"There is a reason everyone is giving this dress 5 stars. it is stunning, flattering, versatile and comfortable. i'm a slim, athletic size 4-6. my store only had one of these and it was a medium. i'm generally a small but on the hanger it looks like a slim tube so i thought i'd try it. fits fabulous. due to the stretch and shape of the dress i'd say a size medium could fit a 4-10. so, don't worry about sizing up or down one in this dress. suuuuuper stretchy so even though it fits close down throu",5
"This is a nice, soft shirt that is very comfortable to wear. the collar on this shirt makes this more than just a regular shirt. although the shirt seems more fitted on the model, i found it to run large. if you are going for the same look, you might want to size down. however, i like the shirt and am keeping it. it is a good thing too, because the navy color went fast. very nice shirt and a pretty good price too.",5

"I own several of these tops and i love them. i am 5'10, 140 lbs and i wear a small. i bought the gray and white stripe and the ivory and black stripe and they are very flattering. the front hits me at the same place as it does on the model and the back covers my butt. i own several of the solid colors in this style as well and they are just as great. this shirt is so soft and comfortable, you won't regret buying it!",5
I purchased this tank for the interesting open neck not realizing that the straps are elastic. i love it. the material is super soft and it fits nicely. snug but not too tight. the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps and the neckline being a little wider is really flattering. i got the black one but i am going to get more colors! great buy!,5
These jeans are my favorite skinny jeans. they are expensive but so worth it. i had nordstrom reinforce holes with patches so they still look distressed but won't rip further. i wear these at least once a week.,5

"The color of this dress is sublime. so is the fit. ruching in all the right places. made me feel glamorous. it's a dress that you can easily wear to a holiday party and then still rock it a couple of days later with a sweater coat, vest, or cropped jacket. the material feels so nice against the skin too. it's a must have.",5

"Wow. bailey 44 knocks it out of the park with this sensual, i-am-woman-hear-me-purr body-slimming dress. we all have our hang ups. this dress forces you to see all the beauty that everyone else sees. the rouching covers up any dimpling or rolls you think you have. the body conscious structure lets you see those curves you knew existed but deny yourself from loving. oh - you hate your arms? me too! guess what - you don't even notice them because you're so focused on how amazing you look. the cut",5

"This is a very awkward and unflattering shirt. i am very petite--90 pounds and 5'2"". the arms fit--length and width, but nothing else about this fit. the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath. it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs. yikes! it looks cute on the model, but not on me. the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top.",1
"I wasn't planning on loving this dress when i tried it on. i loved the the color which is what prompted me to buy it. this dress fit perfectly. it hugs my body without feeling tight. the ruching is perfect. i didn't want to take it off! it's also very comfortable.
i'm 5'1"" , 107lbs and the xs petite fit perfectly. the dress hits me at the same length that is pictured. i think it would be easy to hem if you wanted it to be shorter. i have a short torso and saw no issues with that as some reviewer",5
Like the style of a blazer but the fabric of denim. looking forward to pairing with dresses and black pants,5

What a great jacket. love the subtle windowpane design and the color blue is a nice denim hue. i chose my standard size i wear in retailer jackets on this in house brand. i wish though it was made in the usa as i have several other jackets by cartonnier that are made in the usa. thus jacket looks so polished with jeans to a denim skirt to a bottom that is similar in fabric and texture. very happy with my purchase.,5
This sweater is beautiful but runs large all over. i ordered a m and returning for a small. hopefully that works.,5
"I'm so glad that i took a chance on these; they're fabulous! i wasn't sure about sizing since my local store didn't carry them, but as a wider-hipped 14 i went with the xl. it was the perfect fit and i couldn't be more pleased. the skirt is the perfect touch since it gives my flat booty the illusion of shape and provides a little coverage (not that you'd need it- there's no show-through whatsoever.) love!",5
"This dress is gorgeous in person and so comfortable. i wore this to a business meeting and got several compliments on it. i am 5 feet tall and it does run a little long on me, a petite small hits me slightly below the knee. however, the dress is so nice that i am keeping it.",5
"This is a great basic shirt. it has room in the midsection so you can tuck in or not. it is also extremely soft. i am 5'9, a 10 and the m fit just right.",5
Yes! i am 5' 120 lbs and busty. this hugs in the right places. there is no extra fabric so it doesn't appear overwhelming on me as even some petite blazers do. i had purchased the same brand blazer but in the mustard color and it did not fit well. this fits beautifully. the denim color is just like the picture. the sleeves are a tad long. so i just rolled them up - no bulk. i ordered a size 6 petite.,5
"This blazer is really well made, it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size, i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!",5
"This is the perfect grab and go t-shirt. i love the fun design as it takes a simple t-shirt and makes it fun. i originally ordered the small but it was way to big for me especially at the waist. the bottom half of this top is much looser and if you want to have a more fitted look, size down. very cute.",5
Love this skirt. it was on my wish list from the first time i saw it in the catalog. so glad i was able to get it when it hit sales. i love it. thr color is more subdued than pictured but very nice anyway. the cut is awesome and flatering pretty true to size for me (petite) winner,5
"After reading previous reviews i definitely had to give this a try since i have broader shoulders than the average woman. my regular size (small) was not available anymore so i went with medium and i have to say it worked out well. the small would have not given me the slouchy factor that the medium gives me. this top definitely has no problem staying ""off the shoulder"" since i have broad shoulders it doesn't completely come off me. loving the boho-chic vibe of this!",5
"Pros: this skirt is a stunner. beautiful, rich color and great quality. the cut is conservative enough to be work appropriate, but the little peek of above-the-knee leg where the slit is makes it interesting and flattering as well.

cons: slightly smelly when it comes out of the bag- i'm optimistic this will mostly go away though. expensive.

fit: i'm 5'8"", 125 lbs, 34b, normally wear a 26 or 27 in pants, and the size 2 fit great. i often wear a size 4 in skirts despite a size 2 fitting fine in",5
"I'd been eyeing this for a long time but couldn't afford the full price. when it came on sale, my size -- regular 8 -- was sold out. so i took a chance and went with the petite 8 (only difference is length). and am i glad i did!

it fits beautifully, even a little roomy. but the length is perfect. the longer pieces are at/barely below the knee, and the shorter flap is about two inches above. (for reference, i'm 5'7"", 135 pounds, measurements 38-30-38.)

the skirt is substantial, with high-qualit",5
"Love this substantial pieced suede skirt by leifsdottir. the photos i posted show the color in daylight on a cloudy day. a bit more muted darker turquoise than the online pictures. imagine a mini pencil skirt made of non-stretch polyester with a suede front panel. over this is the longer, open skirt, which is attached at the sides to keep it from flying up when you walk.

"Coat is very soft and comfortable. runs large; usually wear an xsp, could have gone with an xxsp, if it came in that size. the lining is very soft. can wear a sweater or something heavier underneath, if needed.
some small, little pulls on outside fabric, but, might be part of the fabric. outside fabric is very soft. would not have paid full price; glad it was on sale, as i had been eyeing it for some time. it is cute, and felt like twirling, when put it on!",5
"I was hesitant to buy this dress with all the reviews regarding poor fit, particularly in the bust area, but it's so unique that i decided to give it a try anyway by ordering a petite size. i was pleasantly surprised to find that it fits beautifully in my usual size. i did not find the bust to be small at all, and the overall fit was very slimming and flattering. for reference, i am 5'2"" 110lbs 32dd, and the size 2p looks great and is very comfortable.  the 0p might have worked too. the material",5
"I absolutely love this top. i am short (5'2"") but curvy on the bottom with a 36dd bust. i ordered the xl, only because of my upper body. it fits great, as i don't like anything to hug my body. but it doesn't look like a tent. has a little a-line shape to it. another reason i go for the larger size is i like to dry all my clothes. ordered the grey and will order in the black, also.",5
"I love a dolman. the tassled dolman is slimming, light and comfortable.",5
Love this top. work appropriate and dress down worthy. i also like the fact that it is not clingy around the waist. comfortable fabric.,5
"This dress is a beautiful vibrant color and a classic fit and flare fit. it does seem to run a bit large, i am 5'0"" and 120 lbs. and wore a 2 petite. it fit nicely and was flattering but still a little roomy. 

i added a beaded belt to dress it up for my maid of honor duties and despite all the running around, dancing, hugging, buckling the brides shoes and holding my children the lace did not fray and the shape held up beautifully.",5
"I tried this on at the store and i agree with the other reviewwers on the sizing. instead of purchasing my usual size 6, i bought the size 8 as it was indeed a bit tight in the chest for my 34d chest but it was no biggie as they had my size. i love all the embroidery and lace, the length, color and detail on this one. it's also soft and made from cotton so it will be just perfect for summertime and will look adorable with tights and boots and a cardi or jean jacket in the fall:)",5
"I swooned over this dress when it first came online. i had never worn a petite size before so i wasn't sure about the fit. i am curvy (34dd-27-42) and normally wear a size 8 dress, but the 6p fit me like it was made for my body. i think this is because the dress runs large, but i really really enjoyed the fit. the quality of the lace is evident immediately and the color is more of a cornflower blue, which i adore. the lace feels like a soft cotton, but has a lot of strength to it. cannot recomme",5
"Despite the mixed reviews, i went ahead and bought this in my normal size. i am small-chested (34b) and found this to fit perfectly, so i understand why those with large chests were finding this impossible to fit at the top. the fabric and detail are stunning on this. there is not a lot of give to the fabric, but if you are smaller in the bust. buy it!",5
"I wanted a turtleneck for layering with cardigans and vests. i ordered the burgundy color in an xs (my usual, 2) and the color is lovely and deep. i absolutely love it. the ribbed design is comfortable. the neck drapes as shown, so it is not constricting at all.",5
I tried this on in store in a small and then ordered the medium online i loved it so much! i generally run a small/medium with retailer so i thought this was pretty true to size. i'm also longer through the torso so the medium is better for me to cover my stomach when tied.  it is on the thinner side but not see through. perfect for layering and for a mild california winter. can't wait for it to come!,5
This is so comfortable and flattering and hides everything but yet is fun! i actually love to wear it with jeans. and it goes great with a really great piece of jewelry.,5
"My measurements: i'm a 36b so i got the medium. it fits perfectly. i originally purchased this in the gray to wear during the day in winter months, but i loved it so much that i came back and purchased the black for evenings with skinny jeans and heels. it's so soft and pretty, can be dressed up or down, and now i'm thinking about getting the wine color too! i *love* it. i washed it in cold/gentle and let it air dry and it held up fine. i wouldn't push it though. treat it delicately. it's a smar",5
"I love this sweater!!! i checked runs large, but it's really just a roomy sweater. i bought the small, which is what i usually buy, but it is big enough to wear over long sleeve shirts, etc. it's soft and cozy and i think i wore it 3 days straight when i first got it - one of those pieces that you will wear over and over. wore it with jeans and a blouse, then with palazzos and a tee and then over my workout wear the next day before deciding it was time to give it a rest! love this sweater!!",5
Love this turtleneck! it's perfect for fall and to layer. i'm usually an xs in things from retailer and this is no different. i definitely recommend.,5
"I bought this dress for my mom! she usually does not even try dresses on because she feels that they highlight her ""problem areas"", but she is going on a vacation soon and i thought she could should bring something different for her trip. thankfully, the embroidered waters shirtdress completely surprised her! the fabric is soft and light, the blue is vibrant and perfect for spring/summer, and the cutwork detailing is flirty without being too risky or revealing. she's really excited about this--a",5
"Love this top. looks great on, not uncomfortable. it's the right length, the fabric is nice and it feels good on.",5
"I have been eyeing this top for a couple weeks and finally found it in my store. it was a good sign when i saw our stores in-house stylist wearing it! i absolutely love the fit--it's soft and stretchy and fabric is nice quality. i'm typically a medium, sometimes large--i bought the medium and it's perfect. i could have gone down to a small as well. the large was way too big (for reference i'm 5'8"", athletic, 150lbs). this top is going to take me everywhere this summer! worth a try!",5
"I really was surprised at how much i liked this top. it is, as others pointed out, a poncho type overlay with a tank connected underneath. it is very comfortable and forgiving of any body boo boos. looks great with skinny white pants.",5
I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i tried it on and i love it. plus it is very comfortable. i would highly recommend it!,5
"Perfect cozy sweater, nice details. exactly what i wanted to upgrade from sweatshirts.",5
"I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap, is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away.",1
"I am 5'8"" and about 145 lbs - curvy through hips, small up top and i got a small and it fit great. i got it in the wine and it is a pretty color for fall into winter. the fabric is super soft and cozy!",5
Loved this jacket so much i bought both colors! this jacket is simple yet adds so much to an outfit. the lightweight material makes it perfect for the florida seasons. as for the snaps mine work perfectly i usually just keep them undone for my hands. the sizing i think runs a bit large. i usually am a medium but ordered smalls and they fit perfectly even with the perfect amount of breathing room. highly recommend,5
Loved this so much i bought it in black and in grey. it fits perfectly and it lays awesomely!! i ended up buying the black in medium and the grey in large for a bit of a different look for each. i usually wear a medium or large so i'd say it fits super true to size - just depends on how you want it to fit!,5
"I love this vest-it is a work of art in its design and construction but extremely wearable, absolutely gorgeous on, and perfectly warm and functional. my favorite thing i've ever bought at retailer.",5
"Very soft, clean feel. i got this in pink and received so many compliments. perfect to layer on top of your favorite tee or tank. i wish they had it in navy as well.",5
This top is great for layering or by itself over skinny jeans or leggings! i'm 5'5 and this is the perfect length! ??????,5
"I am tall, so this dress hits slightly above the knee on me. the peek-a-boo detail on the skirt and shoulders is flirty, but still modest. this dress is super comfortable and is going to be a summer staple for me. i also love that this dress is button-down, it is an easy piece to wear for new moms!",5
"I went to retailerplpogie today to try this piece on and it was adorable. i really liked the lace part that lightly shows off the legs. this does run true to size. i am 5'5 and 116 pounds and wear a 34b and i was able to button up everything and be comfortable in a size 0. there is no stretch at all with the materials that they have used, so that might be an issue for some. the material was actually a bit thicker than what i would have thought for dress like this, but i really liked it overall and",5
This dress is so cute! will you be bringing it back retailer?,5
This dress is very flattering. great unique dress.,5
"This hoodie has a lovely, flattering drape and fits true-to-size (m for me), and is light but quite warm. the cottony nylon layers along the front panels and hood add style. it will be warm enough as an outer layer on a slightly brisk day or indoors in cooler weather. i was going to opt for the blue, but in the store, the light gray ~ which is a bit darker and more marled than online (at least on my monitor) ~ looked really lovely and seemed more versatile.",5
"Great turtleneck, very comfortable and not tight around the neck at all. the material is super soft and washes well. i ended up getting all 3 colors. my only regret is that there are only 3 colors! i absolutely love this top. i also like the many complements i've received while wearing them. i am full figured and the fit is very flattering.",5
"A feminine yet mature looking cami. i did not need to wear a bra because the material is thick and stretchy (i am a 34a). it looks great with a pencil skirt as well as chino shorts. feels soft and comfy. can dress it up or down. i took a small and it fit perfectly  (l am 5'4"" 120lbs).",5
"I love the dress, fits as pictured , i'm a size 4 and fits just right. it is a keeper, well made.",5
Very comfortable and looks really good on me. that's very important!,5
So disappointed! beautiful dress in the photographs but the cut was incredibly strange. loose and baggy through the top and mid-section but tight around the buttock and thighs.,1
It's super soft. it fits great. happy with the purchase.,5
The pictures don't do this cardi justice. it's so lovely and ladylike. it's seems very well made. please can we have more from this designer??,5
Looking forward to wearing this on chilly spring mornings. ordered in the navy. fits true to size.,5
"This is probably one of the best retailer purchases i have ever made! this is the most comfy and warm cardigan and is a good thickness for fall and winter. i am 5'9, a size 6/8 and the medium was perfect! buy this now!!",5
"This goes well for cool weather. great with jeans or other casual pants. i got the green, it's more of a teal color but pretty. runs large. i usually run between small and medium, i got the small and it's a tad too loose on me.",5
"This is the best item i have gotten form retailer. the quality is amazing. soft, covers my butt, classic piece!!!",5
"I ordered the navy/gray version in size xl. it fits me true to size, matching the online photos. the colors matched too. the fabric is so soft. it's warm while being lighter in weight. very comfortable. the collar wasn't bulky either. it's made to last. one of my retailer favorites.",5
Great long cardigan! i wear this with a simple tank,5
"These are just perfect, exactly as pictured if not nicer. very soft and comfy with a big sweater on for winter months.",5
"These jeans! i am obsessed. the perfect boyfriend fit with an easy, relaxed feel. i feel instantly cooler when i slip into these. do yourself a favor and buy them!!",5
Just not as long as in the picture. it hit me at my hips not good!,1
"This is a lovely spring blouse with a touch of linen. the color and fit is exactly as on the model. there is a sweet touch of trim around the waist in a steel blue. i can pull the top over my head without unbuttoning it. it is tts in my opinion. although the buttons on the back add a nice flair, they are very fine bottons and tend to unbutton on their own. i just tightened the buttonholes with white thread and the problem was fixed so, that's why i gave it 4 stars for design.",5
"This is a fabulous cardigan/jacket!! i saw it on line and read the great reviews and happened to find one of each color in two different stores!! i bought them both!! i have practically lived in them the last week in rainy, cool weather!! the white one goes with everything, and the blue one in fabulous with jeans and probably other things as well. i have gotten several compliments on them immediately. they are just the right weight--not too heavy but heavy enough and a good sturdy, quality mater",5
"This is such a comfy top, and the fabric is really great. more supple / flowy than i expected. it does run larger than i expected. i typically wear a large, and it's almost more billowy than i would normally prefer. i would love to try a medium to see the difference, but since it was purchased online, i'm just going with it. this will get lots of wear this season.",5
"I absolutely adore this cardigan. it's easy, so comfortable, stylish and absolutely flattering on every shape!! what i love about it most is how long it is. i'm 5'8 and the large and xl come well below my bum. it's perfect to wear with leggings and boots when i'm having a relaxing easy day, but i can easily dress it up with denim or a dress underneath! totally versatile! i originally bought this in a large and it fit well. but then we got the xl in the store and i snagged that one too because i",5
These socks were very thin and the elastic at the top was very rigid. i could not get these socks to go any higher than half-way up my calf. i would not recommend this product. it felt very cheap and not of good quality.,1
"Beautiful and soft and so well made cropped cardigan by the in house retailer branding. the color is more muted in person but will work with many different skirts and pants including jeans. i have many ideas for this lovely cardigan ! the size medium for my 34 dd chest, 145 lbs and 5 '4 inches is perfect and the sleeves bellow out a bit which gives this cardigan a nice sharp look. i agree with the other reviewer--- more colors and more of type of quality  and character please for seasons ahead! lo",5
"It's not often you can find a dress that is warm, cozy, timeless, and sexy at the same time, but this one is it. the material is thick but clings to the body in all the right places. i normally wear an xs or s, and in this i took an xs. sleeves are nice and long. your shoulders are exposed as much as you want them to be, depending on how low you fold over the collar piece. i chose to tack mine down in place, so i'm not always adjusting it.

i wore this dress with black heeled over-the-knee boots",5
"This initially caught my eye online and then i immediately tried it on when our store received it. the dress is simple and well structured with a tight sweater weave that almost has a"" hold u in"" feel. therefore, it fits like a glove on!!",5
"Love this dress. it's a nice addition to my summer wardrobe. easy to wear. i am between a large and an ex large in dresses. i did order it in a large, it was a perfect fit but did exchange it for an ex large. i wanted it to have little more swing to it.",5
"Lovely body hugging dress. hits just below the knee. great with boots as shown, or with heels. very soft material and the peppery color is really pretty. i can see myself wearing this to work and out at night. this is a winner!",5
"I went back and bought this dress after a sales associate told me that it was super cute on but didn't look like much on the hanger. i'm 5'3"" and curvy and the s fit great. it will look great with boots or booties. it's very comfortable and nice quality material.",5
"I like this top a lot, and have always liked knotted looks around the bust area. i do not have a large chest, and this kind of top always draws attention in all the right places. i was worried the cut would be too low for my comfort level-and it is low but the shirt does not come away from my body in normal movements so i do feel completely comfortable wearing this without a cami underneath. i don't prefer this in black because i think the color detracts from the bunches of fabric created by the",5
"Soft, comfy, great fit. this is the perfect cozy item for fall and winter. looks really cute with the sleeves rolled or cuffed slightly. the fabric is patchworked with linen and a terry/jersey material. i'm usually a medium and the medium fit great. slimming lines and does a great job of being swingy/flared, without that tent look.",5
"I purchased the black tunic. as others have mentioned, this piece goes great with skinny jeans or leggings. when i'm rushing to find something to wear, this is one of my go-to's. nice coverage. not see-through.",5
"Good quality, cute and great color as pictured. perfect for leggings or tight ankle pants.",5
"Drapes very nicely and runs true to size. easy to wear alone or layer a jacket/cardigan over. i purchased this on sale, and it was a good buy. i am 5'8"" and purchased the size m, as i am a pretty true size 6.",5
"I was afraid the twist at the front would be too bulky, but it adds a nice extra touch to an otherwise simple shirt. i got it in the blue and the color is beautiful. a basic piece with a little bit more; very happy",5
I am so glad i did not miss out on these jeans. i am new to pilcro and am finding they fit me so well!,5
Got this in the gold and it's so much better than i imagined. runs longer on my 5'4 frame than on model but i love this extra long look with white fitted pants and heels. total classic easy elegance and comfortable too.,5
"I wasn't sure how the knotted front would look on me, but it lays perfectly. very comfortable, well-designed, flattering top in lovely rich colors. i'm normally a small-medium in retailer tops, but i got the large as it does run small and i don't like things too clingy. so best to try on in store rather than buy online. nice simple statement piece!",5
"Love the petroleum blue
unique twist design
love the sleeve length
perfect for work -- neckline not too low
great by itself or with a bib necklace and black jacket
absolute winner",5
"As others stated, it was a tad bizarre to have a mock neck on the spring dress, however, i would wear this in the fall with boots and a nice moto jacket. another ""but"" is i wasn't sure about the color. i am very pale and the pale color is pretty much my skin color... however, the blue flowers and black lace make up for it as far as colors, and everyone liked it on me. lastly, cut: wow, this was just really nice on, very flattering,. i usually try on regular size in store and order petite, but th",5
"I finally tried this on now that it went on sale, and it was surprisingly flattereing. love the blue color, and i assume the purple was equally nice. fit is true to size as in i tried on the regular xs and it was great, long but ok for me,",5
"Great shirt that runs true to size. i got the turqouise color which is very pretty. it cuts lower, but doesn't show much cleavage.",5
"This is such a fun dress. the linen and cotton mixture is very unique and comfortable. for reference, i am 5'3"" and about 110 pounds. the regular xs hits me exactly the way it is shown in the photo. the color is a true oatmeal which is so nice for fall and even though i am fair with strawberry blonde hair, it doesn't wash me out. the sleeves are a little long but i rolled them once and it is perfect. i love this dress and it will look great with booties or boots for the fall.",5
"I love the way this looks on me! definitely flattering on curvy/full-figured girls. i am a 36-38c and bought an xl - i don't like things that are too tight or that cling to the wrong areas. if they had xl in other sizes, i would buy it in every color. can be dressed up or down. i'm very happy with this purchase.",5
Beautiful top. works wonderful on hourglass figures.,5
"Great top for day to night. fine for work (i'd think large breasted girls may find it too gaping for work as mentioned, but b cup and below doesn't gape so very work appropriate.)",5
"Upon opening this top, i thought for sure it was going to be too s mall, but it stretches nicely and is gorgeous when on. it is a little thin, and you have to be careful that it's not too tight or you can see skin through the knots, but i love this shirt. i got the xs, which is my usual size. i could probably have used the s, but didn't want to pay for shipping to exchange it as i don't have a store anywhere near me and the xs was fine.",5
"This is a simple, light-weight tunic top. the construction is fine. overall, i'm happy to see a basic executed well.",5
"These jeans are exactly what i was looking for. love the rich olive color. these are definitely an olive green and not a brown color, which i was very happy about. fit is great, i am 5'7"" 150 athletic hippy build and a size 29 fits great. they are the perfect ankle length jean. very soft, and just the right amount of stretch.",5
"I'm always weary of v necks but this shirt is great. the fit is true to size and while it is a v neck, it's not such a deep plunge that you need a cami underneath. great material too and perfect for dressing up a bit. i bought the blue color and love it!",5
"This is my third top from this designer, and normally i wear a small, but i tried this on in the store and the medium fit much better on me. i am not partial to the black as the knot design was lost, but the sapphire is wonderful. works great with slacks or more casual clothes. i liked the sleeve length as well. i'm not too busty, but i think that other reviews comments of the knot being see through could be a problem.",5
"This dress is beautiful. it is even prettier in person than in pictures... i was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail! i am 5'2, 125 lbs and went with a 4p, and it fit perfectly. (i typically do not like things to be extremely clingy). this could easily be dressed up or down. personally, i wore it to a wedding, and received many compliments on its uniqueness.",5
"I love this dress. be warned that even at 5'4"" it is right on the edge of the shortest length that i can get away with wearing. i probably will not wear it to church but for a special event, dinner, or the theater it will be an eye catching statement piece without being over the top. it has a quiet appeal. both layers of fabric are thin but that helps it to conform to my figure without hugging it. it softly drapes showing an hourglass while being extremely comfortable. i think some reviewers int",5
I love this t shirt and have not purchased it in all 3 colors. very soft and very flattering!!! i like the longer length as well as the pretty neckline.,5
Love the wash and fit of this jean. the perfect summer go to for me.,5
"This top is spectacular. intense and color soaked. i got bleu. super stretchy and comfy. the twisty part hugs and emphasizes your curves...even size 34a like me. the v neck is not too wide and low cut. it is narrower, close fitting and attractive. the seam in the middle thorax is a tad strange but it needs to exist due to the twist design. overall this top is cute, long and let's say men and women of all ages will enjoy it. it will make you beautiful on the outside and inside. it is not my usual",5
"Very cute, easy to wear, and looks professional! great for work or a weekend. love this top!",5
"I truly cannot understand the great reviews on this dress!  i purchased in both a sp and a mp.  i am 5'2"" 120#.  the mp fit perfectly.  i definitely wouldn't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together.  it's not super soft, coarse on the inside, and feels old.  the back is longer than the front, it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps.  even with leggings and great boots, it looks worn.",1
"Very pretty dress and a bit different than what we see in the shops!
i found the material to be very nice, despite one of the reviewers comments.
it is a sheath that is not skin tight but shows curves - great for dancing.
also i did not find the neck too tight - fits fine.

"I bought this impulsively to wear to a wedding, and i&#39;m so glad i did. it is so soft and comfy and gorgeous--and has pockets. it&#39;s loose but really really flattering somehow. i would typically get a size 12 in a fitted dress but the medium was perfect for me.",5
I found this in my local atl store that carries petites before seeing it on-line. the materials is lovely and silky with a full lining. the top lace detailing is a nice touch and will make the dress stand out under jackets or sweaters for cool weather. this is great with any shoe type. very versatile year round piece alone or under layers. should be good for all body types.,5

I love this shirt. i would recommend an undershirt.,5

Give me a dress with pockets any day! i loved how i can wear this fall - spring. so cute. so comfortable. can dress it up or down. have 2 events that i'm going to wear it too!,5
I love this dress!  i originally ordered it in a small but returned it for an extra small.  it fits perfectly - love the details.  so classic and comfortable !,5
"This sweater just arrived in my mailbox and it's already my favorite piece of clothing. it is the softest thing i own... and it feels so luxe. as the reviewer below noted: yes, it has pockets. they are slit-style pockets (probably why you can't see them in the photo) and the opening is trimmed with the same cable detail featured on the front of the sweater.

i decided on petite because the overall dress fit my body better, though it is now shorter (a couple inches above the knee0. still looks classy with a boot, but flirtier. embroidery is beautiful, as others mentioned, fabric is comfortable",5
"Bought this to wear to desert trip this weekend when we see the stones, dylan, mccartney, who, roger walters and neil young. think its the perfect outfit as it definitely has an 80's feel, now if only i had a pair of brown or teal boots, it would be perfect. i'll keep hunting~",5

"Love this dress! i'm 5'7"", 135 lbs and typically wear either a small or x-small in maeve. since this one has lots of extra fabric, i ordered it in an xs and xxs. they were basically the same everywhere except the xxs had a much shorter weave pattern at the top, so i ended up keeping the xs. it's great dress, lots of room and swings nicely.",5

"All the positive reviews are right - the shirt is great! something not entirely obvious from the online photos is that there is a slit on both sides of the shirt. makes it even more comfortable and flattering. i wasn't sure how i was going to style this for the winter before i received it but as soon as i put it on i had plenty of ideas. it looks particularly great with a chunky scarf, leggings, and boots. it looked great with a close fitting turtleneck underneath. it really can be dressed up or",5
"I saw this dress in my local retailer store, and am not sure why i did not try it on then, but later at home it began to haunt me. i loved the colored embroidery against the black. my husband and i will be traveling to europe later this fall and i wanted to take a dress with me that wouldn't take up too much room, and be suitable for times when i wanted to dress-up a little. online i saw that it was available in the petite, and with the reviews warning that it ran large i opted for a medium petite",5
I have been looking for a cuddly yet nice looking sweater like this one for a long time. i love anther as they always deliver what i am looking for.,5
"This cute top fits great. it's got a nice fit on arms, shoulders, and bust, then flares out a bit to give ease to the tummy area. the back has a cute button trim and solid blue inset. cute top!",5
I bought this dress on sale and it is perfect! i wish that i would've invested sooner and picked it up in a number of different colors. the cut is amazing and the cutout on the back is sexy without exposing too much skin.,5
"The embroidery grabbed my attention, but i loved the way it felt once i tried it on. the fit is loose (i'm between a small and medium and the small was a bit loose), but still flattering. i really love everything about it, even the lighter weight fabric. i live in the south were fall and winter tend to be on the warmer side. the v-neck is just perfect. i can see wearing this to work as well as out - one of the most versatile dresses i've found lately!",5
"I just love this dress - so comfortable and flattering. maeve has had some great dresses this summer, but this one may be my favorite. this one could easily been worn in to fall with a sweater or jacket.",5
"Beautiful dress that is well constructed. the fabric is substantial and feels expensive.i am 5'4"" and weigh 134, 
36 bust 29 waist and ordered the m/l. i usually wear a 6-8 in dresses, so i worried that it would be too big but it fit perfectly. i am very happy with my purchase.",5
"This dress is gorgeous. it swings beautifully, it's soft, it's incredibly flattering! i would say it runs big. i ordered an xxs petite, normally i would wear xs petite, and it fits great. for reference, i'm 5'1"" and a 32dd. finally a loose fitting dress that doesn't make me look pregnant!",5
"Adore the bright embroidery against the black background!  mine was well done and no loose threads.  although this is all synthetic fabric (which i hate paying for!) but i couldn't help myself once i tried it on.  it's very roomy and if you're slender, size down unless you prefer the breezy swingy look like i do.  this is a three season dress that will do well with layers and without.  i picked regular hem instead of petite and it actually looks slimmer on me than the shorter version.",5
"I'm glad i saw this item in stores, otherwise i would have passed it right by online. the embroidery is intricately detailed and sharp, and the fabric quality is great. i had to size down for this dress. it's comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. its a great versatile piece!",5
The embroidery on this dress is beautiful in person. perfect dress for fall.,5
The only strange thing is the size. i used to wear size s (117bl) but this time the small is way too big. i still keep it and put a belt on. it is a very very pretty dress. i used to buy sale from antheropologie. but can not wait this time. i am very impressed by the design. can not praise more!,5
"I just love this top, it has a flattering cut, fun summer colors! i purchased the white and paired it with the plata chevron skirt. both pieces go with everything and can be dressed up or down. perfect for traveling. only tricky part for me was reaching all the buttons in the back. highly recommend!! stock more pieces like this retailer!",5
"I am so pleased with this top! it is slightly fitted - i am 5'3"", 110 lbs, - and have trouble finding tops that are flattering but not too form fitting. also it is 100% cotton, which is a definite plus. as of now it is my go-to top - looks great with jeans or leggings.",5
I don't normally like how i look in rompers but this one was so cute i had to try.  i was pleasantly surprised that it fit great and was comfortable too!,5
"I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding and couldn't be happier! i'm very curvy (34dd-28-43) and the medium fit like a glove. the fabric has a great 70's vibe while the fit is extremely classic. i have never felt more beautiful and received many compliments. i am 5'6"" and it hit just to the top of my feet. i highly recommend.",5
"I love this romper! i wear it as lounge wear around the house and to bed. it shows a bit more skin than i'd be comfortable showing in public but perfect for around the house. i'm usually a medium but it hung on me weird so i sized down and it's absolutely perfect!  love the color, the fabric and how it falls just right and the ultra softness is heavenly.",5
"I bought this dress to wear at a wedding. i am short, so i would have really loved the petite, but they were sold out both online and in store when i bought it. i'm making do with high heels. the sheen is gorgeous and the dress is very comfortable over all. i'd also add that i'm pretty curvy and the cut fits my body perfectly.",5
"I love this top, it's not too fitted and falls in the right part of my waist giving me good movement. i wear it to work and everyone compliments how the back is longer the top doesn't ride up your back!",5
"I tried this one twice, in the same day, the first time, i didn't like it, the stylist in the dressing room at the time dind't etiher, but then my favorite stylist finally showed up (:-) ) and i tried it on again, but at the time, had changed pants... made all the difference. you really need hte right pants for htis, but it is gorgeous.

i bought hte black color online, i liked it better, the white has stell colored polka dots, so if you want more of a spring color, also good for you.

style: ca",5
"I loved this shirt from the moment i saw it on the table. i am always too tall for a peplum blouse because they hit my rib cage instead of my waist, but this shirt doesn't have that problem! i have the white one, the polka dots are a really pretty corn flower blue color. i usually wear an 8 in maeve blouses, but this one i took a 6. there is definately no give though. i have a very flat chest and only wear a lacy bralette under this shirt because there is no room for anything else. i am sad thou",5
This product fit perfectly. the color is as pictured or slightly bigger. perfect for a day or night out,5
"Picked this up in the white, and it's adorable. i'm a 2 in maeve blouses, usually just to fit my bust. i picked it up in the 2 because that's all my store had, and it fits. it's definitely tight across the bust, but not constricting. the shirt has no give, but it's still comfy, and to be expected from 100% cotton. the peplum is very dramatic high-low, and poofs out in the back also a little dramatically but gosh that's what makes it so gorgeous! great blouse, so precious.",5
This dress is soft and hits all the right spots. the neckline makes it a little alternative which i like.,5
"Love this and wish it came in more colors. the fabric and cut are so comfortable. i bought my usual size and was a little sad to see that it shrunk just a touch in the wash. washed and then air dried but put in dryer for 15 mins to speed up drying process. i'm 5'7"" so it's already short but now i'll probably just have to wear it as a cover up or loungewear around the house. super cute though and great price with sale on sale!",5
"Love the fit and color, but the material is my favorite. it's so soft and comfy. feels like your walking around in your pjs!",5
Hello i could not see how this dress could get anything but a 5 star review . the only thing that i thought would be a negative is that it may stag easily. other than that this dress is stunning on and i feel it runs large . i wear a sz 4 and the xs fit just right i'm 5ft 6in tall looks great with a high heel since its really long to the floor which i like as far as the shine on this dress. i love it it makes it worth the price and dresses up a casual dress . and its very comfortable .,5
"This is a great fit and super cute, price not bad either!!",5
"I broke my rule of not buying polyester for this dress, twice (helped by sale price with additional percent off promo). it's mainly the irresistible print, i bought it in both the lovely blue-pink floral and the patterned red. love it. works best when the weather is in upper 60s, with tights and boots, but i think it will also work with bare legs and clunky sandals when the weather is warmer. the fit is loose except for in the chest and shoulders, so don't size down. i do wish the fabric was not",5
"I debated getting this dress for over a month and finally purchased it on retailer member day for 20%off. i wore it on a chiller night with a denim jacket and booties for a more casual feel. constant compliments from friends and strangers. 

only complaint about the dress is the slit. it does not go as high like on the model, stops right at the knee.the cross over is not too revealing (which is nice). overall the fit is great! im 5&#39;6 and usually size 12 and 36dd, the large was perfect!",5
"This top is true to size for me, i'm 5'8'' 128lbs, and i ordered both a size 4 and 6. the six was too big, i could tell because the shoulder seem was in the wrong spot and i couldn't lift my arms, the shoulder seem hung too low. the 4 was perfect, i had full range of motion for my arms and was easily able to bend down and touch my toes without any pulling on the buttons of the shirt. i always order a small or size 4 in tops. the bigger size didn't add any length in front just added a boxier feel",5
"This is a great casual top for spring! i loved the covered buttons in the back, and the longer back peplum too. the peplum in the front covers the top of pants. i am 5'9"" tall and often times have difficulty finding sleeves that are long enough, so the 3/4 length sleeves are perfect. the fabric is light weight but not sheer, and the embroidered dots are well done.",5
I love this tunic! the fit is ttt and the quality is nice. i will get much use out of this piece!,5
I absolutely love each this dress! it is shimmery as others have said but the design looks so beautiful that way and i don't agree that it mages it look cheap. love the neckline and the length is perfect unless you're a petite size. i would snatch this one right up if it weren't for the price point. i'm hoping it'll go to sale but it's so beautiful it might be sold out by then . the fabric seems delicate like he threads could come apart easily.,5
"I love this dress! the beading gives it something special and the petite fits my 5"" frame perfectly. lightweight enough to wear now and again later with layers for fall. very soft fabric!",5
"Love this top, it's a 100% cotton and looks amazing with jeans. you should consider ordering a size up, i am usually an 0, 32d and 107pound. tried the 0 in store it just didn't feel right the size 2 fit just right.
love the shirt, and got tons of complement:)",5
These are the most comfortable trousers in my whole wardrobe.  love them.,5
Not for shorties. i'm 5'3 and will need to get them hemmed.,5
"Fit is perfect! very flattering. they are very long, so i will need to shorten.",5
"I am in love with this dress. not too dressy, not too casual and hugs the body in all the right spots. i am 5'7 with curves and this flatters well. i also bought (and adore) the velvet taupe ankle strap shoes they show with them, super in-love with the whole look. dress will look great with booties too. just hope i don't snag the sweater dress, which looks easy to do, because i want to wear this all fall and winter long.",5
"Bought this dress for engagement photos and was a little worried about sizing, but when i got it it fit perfectly and was very comfortable. it runs true to size. my only complaint is that there was a missing button on the sleeve, but because there was an extra it was easily fixed. definitely recommend!",5
"This is a beautiful shirt. the back is a few inches longer than the front which makes for a cool effect.
the only thing that i didn't like about this shirt was how fragile the buttons on the back are. i was taking this shirt off and one popped off. when i went to hang it, another one popped off! so i had to return it. such a shame.",1
"The fabric is a little stiff, the back looks unusually long compared to the front, and it fits tight across the chest. and i'm not busty so that's not a factor.",1
Great winter maxi. soft and comfortable fabric. good quality. stretchy but not too clingy. fitted in all the right places and very flattering. petite was unavailable so will need hemming.,5
"I love rifle paper, and when i saw this dress online, i knew that i had to have it. this dress is even prettier in person than it is in the picture. it's pretty and delicate, and can easily be dressed up or down. i found this dress to fit true to size. it definitely has that ""baby doll dress"" fit to it, but i love it! this is a dress that i'll feel beautiful in and pull out of my closet over and over again.",5
"This romper is sooo comfortable and cute! it is definitely pretty casual, and probably best used as a beach cover up, as it exposes a lot of skin. that being said, i have worn it out and about on very hot days and felt totally fine. as far as sizing, i usually order a small, and got this in a small and it fit perfectly.",5
This dress is amazing! i love the collaboration with rifle paper. it has a nice boho swing look. i sized down from my typical small and took an xs. both fit well but i wanted the shoulders to be more fitted.,5
This dress will be perfect for the mid-september wedding i'm attending. september is a transitional month fashion-wise and this knit dress will be perfect. the shimmer (which isn't apparent from the website) makes it festive enough for a wedding.,5
"I fell in love with dress immediately! it runs small, but is very flattering, even if you have a little you want to hide. i went up 1 size. so comfy and beautiful! love!!",5
I love the colorblock color combo. the colors are neutral enough to go with so many things yet still be unique and stand out. the fit was perfect. i took my normal size medium.,5
I love the color and shimmer of this dress. it is very unique and one of a kind. the slit is not as high as the photo online but that can be adjusted if need be at a tailor. it's a great dress!,5
"This is much cuter in person than in the picture. in person, i am much more aware that it is also a lower length in the back and it flairs just a little so that the design really stands out. i bought in the white and blue dots and can see wearing it in the now, spring, and even summer! it is just a tad tight in my size 10, so i went up to a 12. thank you retailer - this will be timeless!!",5
"This is the most unflattering peplum top i have ever tried on. fit perfectly as a size 6 should in the arms, shoulder, chest... then the waist was huge! just hung off of me like a flour sack. it was wider than the chest measurements, which made me appear frumpy instead of tailored and classic. combine that with the high-low hemline and it looked like a project runway reject. sent back immediately, do not buy this if you have (or want to appear to have) an hourglass figure, it will do nothing for",1
"This top is extremely well done. it looks classy and timeless. i tried on the white version in store, but chose to order the black as the white was too sheer.",5
"This dress fits and flatters a curvy silhouette. size medium length is perfect for my 5'7"" frame. utterly comfortable and so many compliments!",5
I feel like i'm cheating when i put this on it's so comfy almost like wearing cozy pj's but with my black belt and boots and a cute scarf i can easily wine and dine looking like a million bucks and feeling like i'm lounging at the same time. i wish this came in more colors!!,5
"This dress is my new best friend. i've been looking for work dresses that don't require much effort in putting together an outfit, and this is just it! the pattern is fun and unique (i got many compliments), the cut is comfortable, flattering and feminine. the dress really speaks for itself, and all i have to do is throw it on and run out the door. the only negative is there was a loose piece of thread at the bottom (fingers crossed this doesn't lead to problems later on) and the sleeve buttons",5
"I love love love this swimsuit! yes it's a bit pricey for a bathing suit, but i love the design and colors and the back detailing is sexy yet not all that revealing. i can't wait to wear it in hawaii next month! the only part to be careful about is not to stretch it too much when putting it on and taking it off, i can see the diamond cutouts stretching or even ripping if pulled too hard by accident. overall a great swimsuit for the summer!",5
A very versatile and cozy top. would look great dressed up or down for a casual comfy fall day. what a fun piece for my wardrobe!,5
"I ordered this in xl and the fit on me matches the fit on the model. it's meant to be loose & flowy so i think it's true to size. everything matches the photos--the sleeve length, hem, neckline, etc. it's not a slimming look but doesn't make me look bigger than i am either.

the material is a very soft cotton. the pattern of the lace on the top portion is very pretty. there are sequins mixed with the embroidery on the sleeves. the thread they used for those cutout areas is soft. it's washed well",5
"Material is heavier so maybe not for summer months, but fit & feel great. love that they fall beyond the knee where other leggings can fall just below the knees and be uncomfortable and restricting which makes no sense for ""active"" wear.",5
"I was pleasantly surprised by how well this dress skims over the body. definitely needs the belt that comes with the dress to add some shape. the color is gorgeous, great print and very light fabric - perfect for summer.",5
Beautiful maxi fits tts. i normally wear a 10/12 and took a 12. it is flattering to the waist and makes me feel girly. the colors are so beautiful and the length is good for my 5'9 frame.,5
"I fell in love with the color scheme and knew this would be perfect for vacations and weddings.  colors are slightly muted in reality, seems the retailer filter adds more contrast, but it's still gorgeous!   lining is full length, there's a zipper going up the back, fitted at the waist, and ribbon ties at the back of the neck that are long enough to style at the throat if wanted.  i wasn't sure of my size so i picked my larger range and i'm glad i did.  my weight fluctuates so when it goes down, t",5
"I ordered my usual sz s during the promo. arrived yesterday & the fit is perfect w/ a little room to spare for layering. it's a snap front closure, front patch pockets, & attached hood that is small to med size-not huge or overwhelming. it's 100% acrylic which isn't my 1st choice, but soft, comfy & seems good quality. length falls abt 3"" below my knees. arm length is fine. pretty much looks as in the pic including the marled color. if you are in need of a great functional long swtr w/ good looks",5
This dress is so beautiful & fits my hourglass figure perfectly. it's fully lined & the print is nicer in person. very easy dress to wear to many summer occasions! i'm an 8-10 on top & 10-12 on the bottom. size 10 dress fit perfectly!,5
I have been living in mine since i bought it! so comfy and dressier than a plain sweatshirt!,5
Love this cardigan! it is a really a sweet and sexy top. so flattering to curves and yet conceals too. the material is wonderfully soft and stretchy.,5
Wore my new red cardigan for the first time today to work. fit is tts. this is a true red and not neon or orange tinted. it wraps nicely in front and has a nice flair at the hips.. i also like the detail in the knit. i like to push my sleeves up and love the fact that they don't slide down my arms all day. i'll wear this cardigan a lot.,5
"This is a great top. soft and cozy fabric, nice and sturdy feeling. it's heavier than i though it'd be so its perfect for the cooler days of spring, and even a chilly summer night. i love that it's long enough in the front for me to feel comfortable wearing leggings. the body is nice and roomy but the arms are a little snug, however, i like that because i think it makes it look less like a slubby sweatshirt. the best part... it can be cleaned in the washer and drier! thrilled with this purchase!",5
This top is really cute. my daughter tried it on and tried to take it.,5
"I usually wear a medium or large in retailer clothes. i purchased this in a large and it fit perfectly. it is a clingier top but i didn't find it too much so. the ribbing makes it very attractive and slimming, and also can be worn as a stand alone turtleneck or easily as a layered piece. it is super soft and comfy as others have mentioned, and a tad thicker than just a cotton turtleneck would be - it has substance. also, it would be great for traveling because it doesn't wrinkle at all. love that!",5
"Love the quality of this material, and how the lines fall on the back. i got a a medium petite because the small was sold out, and i like how it fits. petite sits around the hip area and it's not too long which i like. the color is definitely more of an orange/tangerine color - not red. great cover up sweater!",5
I purchased this sweater in black to dress up my everyday cardigan. this is very soft and can dress up a skirt or great with jeans.,5
"I like it a lot - very soft, just enough detail to keep it interesting, but still a classic look. i got this in a small and it's a little short on me compared to the model. i'm 5'6"", long-waisted, 34b (small side), 145lbs (carry bulk of my weight in legs.so trim on top). i will keep the small but also get a medium; the small ties a little high and i also want a sweater that can cover my shirt tails when i don't tuck them in.. i got it in black, so can't comment on the orange or red.",5
"I just bought this cardigan in black at the store and i love it. the tie at the waist is flattering and the fabric is soft and stretchy. the regular size fit me perfectly as far as where the waist and hem hit, although the sleeves had to be turned up (i'm 5'1"" with more length in torso than limbs). i was so happy with the fit other than sleeve length that i bought the regular small rather than coming online for the petite. because the fabric is rather thin and the shape trim i can fold the sleev",5
"I have been looking for a good red cardigan for some time now. this one perfectly meets my needs, and now i want it in more colors. the sweater has a nice cut, and it is very soft and comfortable. i know this will be a go to staple piece in my closet.",5
Chic and comfortable and looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i'm usually a small/medium and thought the medium had a better overall look - sleeves were just a little long. the detail on the sleeves is kind of like the inside of a sweatshirt and makes it look a little more polished than the average athleisure top.,5
"I bought the red cardigan because i didn't have anything similar and was so pleasantly surprised by the fit and design that i'm going have to buy it in whatever other colors are available. it's very versatile - looks great tied in front, in back, at the side - and has a tiny bit of flare at the bottom so it's more feminine and flirty than your average cardigan. i have a few tops by this brand and have been really happy with the quality and design.",5
"This is a very nice turtleneck. the variations in the ribbing are a modern (and flattering) touch. in some of the photos online it almost looked to me like there are color variations - fyi there are not. all the ribbing areas are the same shade of black.
----------
unless you are very small framed, i would recommend sizing up; or, if you typically wear a m or a l, go with the l. as reference i have wide shoulders (wider than my hips), large biceps, and a 34b chest, and i went with the l because",5
"I never would have thought to choose this, but an retailer associate suggested the black sweater as a topper while i was trying on the camellia dropwaist dress, and it made a sale, i bought them both! the sweater, while not decked with beads or embroidery, adds an incredible definition to any outfit that is overly flowy. i would say the photo above showing the grey sweater says it all. usually a size 6 in retailer dresses, the small fit well. i appreciate the cotton fiber content, as well as the ver",5
"Love this cardigan, ordered the red which is a nice tomato red, but not orange. sz medium fits perfect on my frame, 34dd, 145 lbs and 5 '4. love the style and finishes a pant, skirt or dress nicely. i just may order the black ! did not see this item in the store near me, but lucky to order it on sale. beautiful quality.",5
"This was such a nice surprise. it's way more sweatshirt than i thought, and maybe a touch bigger than i thought, but it's super cute and comfortable. i've worn it a bunch of times already.",5
This top is exactly what i was expecting. super comfortable while still looking stylish. just covers your bum so you can wear it with leggings or jeans!,5
What a nice sweater! i just received this in the gray and i think it is one of the most flattering sweaters i've gotten in a long time. the fit is true to size. the sleeves are very long and tight halfway to the elbows and fit well in the upper arms. the stitching on the body gives an illusion of height and is slenderizing. the weight is perfect for every season. i am very happy with everything about this sweater.,5
"I love this dress and it is going to be my go-to summer dress. the fabric is great with just a slight amount of stretch. it is true to size. i am 5ft 8"" and it is not too short on me. the arm holes and the rest of the fitting is just perfect. the pockets are also very functional. the color is a darker moss than a brown that it looks like in the pictures. the retailer dresses i order online offlate are returned 90% of the time due to ill fitting or for not being what i expected in general, however",5
"Oh my god - i love this skirt. i first order the size 4 and immediately called customer service and had them send me a 2. i found it be be both plenty stretchy (great for moving, sitting, etc) but runs on the large size. but the fit is amazing. i love the length - a perfect knee-skimmer for me (5'9""). i love the color (green) and the pockets and button fly are so fun without being too much! i've tried it on with several tops and sweaters in my closet and this skirt is going to be one that i can",5
"What an adorable, classic style fringed top this is! i recently purchased this in my regular size but i should've read the reviews first and ordered a size up. when i went up from a size 6 to an 8 (34d-27-35), it fit me perfectly and looks so cute on! i think this one feels well made and i love the little details of the beads and how the fringe is placed. it looks very flapper girl;) i bought this on sale in the pink color and cannot wait until spring and summer to wear with jeans or a skirt!",5
"I wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product. label says that you can wash and dry normally. however, upon washing, the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not. the robe will now not lay flat; the fabric pulls at the edges, and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut. extremely disappointed. for a $100 garment, i expected much more. i wish i could return this.",1
"Almost the perfect skirt! great colors,super cute fit,very flattering,great length,very versatile. only issue was size; normally a solid 10, i ended up a full 2 sizes smaller. very stretchy and comfortable,just try it on first or order a couple of sizes. go down at least 1 size. as others have said...pilcro strikes again,its such a great brand with the most flattering shapes and fabrics.",5
"These pants are fabulous. the flow and feel made my mind up easily to purchase these. i have a long torso and short muscular legs. the style complimented by body type. being culottes, the hem should probably fall higher up on my legs. i will probably have them hemmed. the pleat has a nice kick to it. now off to find the right pair of shoes...",5
"I took advantage of the sale this weekend & purchased this super cute vest yesterday which made it a more justifiable purchase. it's so soft, fits tts & i just can't wait for cooler weather so i can start wearing it!",5
I ordered this as a gift and may order myself one. it is so comfortable and pretty.,5
"Loved these culottes! flattering fit and nice drape. the fabric, though poly, is of a nice weight and swishes nicely as you walk. the length (just below knee length) works for me too. the color is lovely for the fall - rich copper and easy to pair . i'd say these are tts but if in doubt, size down. i""m between a size 8-10 and the 8 works best for me.",5
This robe is incredibly soft! it is wonderful to put on right after a shower and it is very warm! the sleeves are lined with a jersey like material and they are so easy to get on and off. it fits true to size. i am so excited to have this robe!!!,5
I ordered these culottes because they looked comfortable yet elegant. they are indeed both!,5
"I have been looking for a tan color skirt so i ordered this as soon as i saw it. so glad i did the deep camel color can still be worn in late summer as styled in the product photos and transition to fall staple. the material is nice weight , and has a stretch. the cut has a little 60's vibe that i love. i think it should keep it's shape hopefully launders well. i think it runs slightly large, as my waist is large in comparison to my hip proportion and there is no pinch for me. i will rebuy this",5
"Love this vest! saw it and bought it instantly. i'm 5'8"" and slim and got the xs. it fits perfectly. there is a lot of ""puff"" to it, but it's really warm and soft.",5
"Tried these on out of sheer curiosity -- i've got a long torso & was pleasantly surprised how flattering they are! they manage to look flowing & sleek without shortening the legs. took a size 6 with my 27"" waist, 37"" hips. it's a bit of a generous fit, especially around the waist, but they're extremely comfortable & have room to tuck tops into. i have the cowled sweater tank in gray & it looks fantastic over these! couldn't resist getting both the rust and black. perfect for a dressy casual look",5
"I am 5'3, curvy and wear a size 12 and these pants look amazing! often i struggle with wide keg pants bc they make me look short and plump, however, the material is buttery soft and hang in an elegant way and most important they are quite flattering. even if you don't think culottes will work for your body type- i suggest you give these a try.",5
"Well made. color is great, goes from summer right into fall. looks good with sandles and will wear with boots later on. goes well with classic tee, denim shirt or plaid blouse. has a retro/ classic look.",5
"Love this skirt. super comfortable, yet nicely tailored. roomy pockets always come in handy. the dark mustard looks great with the black and white tops that dominate my closet. this will be my go-to skirt for the fall for both my business-casual office environment and weekends out and about running errands, etc. i agree with the other reviewers re: sizing: because of the stretch, if you?re between sizes, you should size down. i'm usually a medium, or size 8 or 10, so i got the 8. i may have been",5
"I love this dress. i am an hourglass and found this dress to be super flattering and such a unique find. i usually avoid pockets in front like this, but it works on this dress. so happy i found it.",5
"First off, these are great because they are not so tight like all other work out crops that my anatomy is not a mystery to people around me. i have an athletic build and these pants are awesome in that they hug the body lightly. they are so soft and comfy also. perfect for running and the gym and apres whatever. i bought a back up pair.",5
"Great versatile skirt, very flattering",5
"I ordered this in a petite (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and size 4p fits perfectly) and it fits very well everywhere. however, i think if you're bigger than 34b, size up, because this top is very fitted around the bust. the bottom hem falls right below my belly button, the neckline is not too low and not too high. i chose black because i feel that there are a lot of details and can be toned down with a darker color. i think this top must be fitted for a tailored look, or otherwise one may risk t",5
I tried this skirt on because i liked the green color thinking that the pockets would not be flattering to my size 12 figure. i was wrong. the pockets are flattering to a round tummy. the pocket flap is stitched down on the side and button near the center so they don't stick out. a good skirt for fall.,5
"This is the worst shirt i have ever tried on from retailer. it is basically a big shaggy box from the front, and from the side it looks like a tent. it is also short.",1
"120 lbs and i saw this while shopping with my sister who is 125 lbs. we both tried on the small and the fit was perfect. i didnot need a petite. it is so soft and i didnt notice other vests with different fabric from each other at all. the vest is just like the photo. its cozy. collar didn't bother me, i wear my top collar out or with a turtleneck. i waited until it was on sale because the price was a little high. but it is very soft and uniquely special.",5
"I bought this sweater in the sky color. just love it, i'll go back for the rust colored one.",5
"Beautiful skirt with a fun, graphic pattern and embroidered texture. i tried on my usual xs as well as a s to compare. they both fit but i decided to keep the xs since the skirt has a little bit of a stretch thanks to a hidden elastic panel in the back, plus it looks best at your natural waist. i'm 5'2"" and often need to wear petite, but this skirt is already quite short so i bought the regular size. looks great bare-legged or with tights. love the pockets too!",5
"Just received the bra and matching panty in the mail and loved it. the true color is a little darker, i would call it a taupe. the fabric is really nice. i am a 34 c and ordered a medium just from my freepeople bra experiences, and they run small. the medium is perfect for my size. i usually order a small panty, and this one fits, it looks smaller than pictured on the model. this set is one of a kind, the pattern on fabric is really beautiful. i think it is worth the price. if you like lingerie,",5
"I ordered the white in this. i found it to be so much prettier in person than the photos. i don't think they do this piece justice. i am normally a medium and that is what i ordered. i found it fit true to size. love the three ties in the back. it's a tad baggy, but looks great. i can see that this might snag easily though.",5
Soft and sweet,5
"Lovely sweater! it's a new staple in my wardrobe. love the fit and styling, but what drew me in at first sight were the colors. it's warm and cuddly.",5
"This is one of my favorite sweaters of the season. it is warm and cozy and looks so cute with jeans. it's definitely a little shorter on me than it looks on the model, even though i'm only 5'4.",5
This sweater was so itchy i immediately was turned off. it looks cute in pictures but another problem was that the knitting in the shoulders looks like a kid made it. it was uneven and stretched out. it looked like it was not well made to me. it also shed so much that just from me trying it on my pants were covered in orange fuzz. i returned this one.,1
Cute twist with the open back on a simple classic sweater... light weight...,5
"This sweater is absolutely lovely. i bought it in the sky color which is so pretty, the picture just doesn't do it justice! the yarn is super soft and it seems as though it will be plenty warm this winter. i also love the retro 70's look. a definite keeper.",5
"Omg i love this sweater. it is minimalistic yet romantic. my mother in-law bought this for me last may when she was visiting and one for herself. i saw it today at the store in white and i snatched it up. i will wear this for years. i did not see until now that is is meant to be worn with the ties in the back. i've been wearing it with the ties in the front. what a bonus that there are 2 ways to wear this wonderful sweater. i will wear these 2 pieces for many, many years.",5
"Absolutely love this top! yes it runs big and is flowy but i think it is very flattering, especially with skinny jeans. loved it so much i bought the navy and wine colors for myself and the green for my mom. for reference i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs (33-25-33) and the xs fit well (falls just above my mid thigh).",5
This sweatshirt is extremely comfy and stylish. i am happy with the item and it runs a snag large but perfect for a sweatshirt.,5
The front of this top is pretty thin and you can see through it,5
"I'm glad i checked out the reviews before purchasing - i went a size smaller and the sweater fit perfectly! i love the taupe color - it's feminine (not overtly so) and i can still use it as a neutral. the quality is really quite good, though i would still suggest keeping metal accessories (without smooth edges) away from the fabric. it's also not too heavy so i can still wear this despite the heat and humidity in honolulu. 

i think the only thing i would consider changing would be the materia",5
"I ordered this a little big because the smallest size that they had was a medium. i probably could have gone with a small, but given that i am a 34d on top (and @ a size 2 on the bottom & @ 120lbs), the medium fits me just fine. it is super soft, and you can wear it with just about anything. keep in mind that your midriff may show a bit depending on how high your bottoms are. however, i paired it with a white pair of skinny jeans with a cute belt (so a teeny bit of my midriff was showing at time",5
"I almost bought this tank online, but decided to wait. once i saw it in the store, i knew i had to have it. i bought it in the ivory color, which is perfect. the gold details are subtle, and so pretty. i don't find it too sheer, as some of the other reviews have stated. the cut is so flattering, and it is easy to wear to work when paired with a cardigan.",5
"Love love love this tunic. it has panels that don't really show up in the picture but the panels make it lay really nice. it's great over leggings and skinny jean cords. could even wear it with opaque tights. it's great for work, play or evening. i bought the navy blue with the heart print. i love it so much i'll probably get the green and the red when they go on sale. this is a pricey top. for reference i'm 5""3 128lbs. 32ddd fits great all the way around and the length is perfect - mid-thigh an",5
"This tunic looks great in person whether you get the red, green, or navy. runs true and hangs well--the ruffle at the bottom is super flattering and the construction of this tunic is impressive! so good i had to get both the red and navy!",5
"This sweater is a lovely color and very soft. however, the sweater 'sheds' terribly and the color is very large distracting from the overall appearance. it's also thin and whatever shirt is worn underneath will show through.",1
"Beautiful, comfortable and attractive sweater! my neckline doesn't stay flat as the one in the photo does, but i love the sweater anyway. great quality, attractive, and comfortable.",5
"I liked the look of this online, but it's even nicer in person. just the right length on the hips, a medium weight, and with enough interest and exposure on the shoulders to make it feel like a stylish option for a slightly cool night without falling into the too-heavy and makes-you-feel-dumpy category of sweater. like the slightly short sleeves too.",5
"I feel in love with this shirt online and purchased it right away. this is one of the those pieces that makes retailer my favorite place to shop... stylish, unique and beautiful. it is a bit full in the bottom so i sized down from my normal s to xs and am very pleased.",5
This has a classic tunic style silhouette with delicate gold threads. it looks even better in person than online.,5
"Easy to wear, but still has a lot of style. i see this becoming a new basic.",5
"Love this sweater for so many reasons; fits true to size, unique in design, versatile, soft and so easy to wear. i've worn it tied in the back and front. it goes great with a skirt or dress pants for work, date night and elevates the look with any of my jeans. i love haying clothes i can get the most out of. highly recommend this sweater!",5
Got this shirt in the green color. it's long and flowy and fits true to size. super comfy.,5
This is my new favorite sweater. soft and comfortable and easy to wear to both work and play. being able to wear different things under this makes it very versatile and easy to change looks.,5
"I got the taupe and loved it so much i ordered the white and wore both this week alone! they are so cute and a great weight in this spring/summer weather we're having in the bay area. 
the taupe is a normal medium and a bit roomy, so ordered the white in a medium petite and it's pretty great. just depends upon how you like to wear it - both are lovely. 

my advice? get two - today! you won't regret it. 
order your regular size - don't size up or down!",5
"Great tunic top! is longer than i thought it would be so i probably could have sized down, definitely covered my butt! but overall a great print and cute top. loving it!",5
"I got the top in green, it is very soft and comfy. it does flare out a little if you wear it untucked but looks really cute tucked into jeans or a skirt.",5
This top is super versatile--i wear it with jeans on the weekend but it's also work appropriate. it's light and perfect for warm weather!,5
"I was so excited to buy it online, but it come in a small plastic bag, and lot of pieces are missing on the one i got, so i had to return it",1
"I love this dress. the pockets are great and the fabric is very soft and similar to other cloth and stone garments. i also love it's made in the usa. my only wish is that the chambray version was as great. (it's not - the pockets are cut bad, it's cut smaller in the chest, and made in china)",5
"The drape of this shirt is flattering, and i appreciate the longer tail in back. the fabric is light, and that is perfect for our fall transition here in so. california. with a sweater, it will be great in winter, too. so far, i've worn it with jeans and booties, and have accessorized it in different ways to dress it up or down.",5
I love an all cotton shirt! feels great and has a bit of quirky styling without being over the top,5
I picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag. im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured i'd try it anyway. this dress is to die for! the xs fit me just fine (though the snap at the chest wouldn't stay closed but i thought it looked ok). i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it. i'm contemplating purchasing it still because i can't stop thinking about it!!,5
"I ordered this top on line. i wanted to love it, but unfortunately the fit was not for me. i am 5'9 with a long torso. this top was cut very wide and looks like a maternity top.",1
"This top fits tts as shown on model. loose, flowy but the cut/details/flounce still give some nice shape. i usually take a s or m at retailer depending on the style/make. went with the small in this. i am 5'5"",narrow shoulders, ruler shape 34dd. no gaping in the front. fits gracefully flows with details that are classic and add the wow factor to this social or work appropriate top. so complimentary, it would flatter many body types. the neckline is juuuuussst right, i fasten the top button to make",5
"Luv this top/dress/coverup..runs a lil big...i sized down for a more fitted look to pair it with cropped skinny jeans! fabric is nice, comfortable and light!",5
This top is beautiful and i'm in love..but.. it'd huuuuggge! i'm always a large in retailer tops. im going to return for a med or maybe even a small ( which is unheard of for me) .... quality is great!!! get it just size down,5
"I got this in a petite xs; it's gorgeous and incredibly soft, great quality as well. my one little caveat is that it's very short; i'm 5'1 with a short torso and it still didn't get very far on me, but if you wear it with high-waited pants/skirt it's not a big deal",5
"Love this top! i tried it on in the store and instantly loved. i wore it and ordered it in another color. i bought my usual size but decided i'd like to have it slightly smaller for the next one, so i ordered down. it can go either way, it's quite flawy and roomy. cool for summer and supper flattering.",5
"This is my new favorite white top in my closet - the loose fit, flowy quality fabric, and effortless versatility are spot on for anyone's wardrobe. i took my usual size s - i wouldn't size down in this because although it's roomy in the torso, the sleeves and shoulders fit perfectly on my thin arms. everyone should have this beauty!",5
"I bought the blue in store and loved it so much that my hubby recommended i buy the raspberry online! i usually buy a medium in tops, but went with the small so it wouldn't be so flowy. fabric is soft and not itchy. i will be wearing these a lot this fall!",5
"The top is quite lovely and good quality. i ended up getting a size 4, which fit similarly to the model photos. i am smaller up top and wide in the hips, but the shape worked well for my shape.",5
"I think this dress is my favorite purchase this whole year! it fits like a dream! i saw it in the store while it was full price and tried on an 8 (the only size they had left!). i typically wear a 6 or 8 in dresses, but the 8 was quite large, so i passed. after it went on sale, i ordered a 6 with my fingers crossed! glad i ordered when i did, as they sold out fast! fabric is a nice substantial weight, great for fall! the fit is great, not tight at all and more of an a-line on me, which is weird",5
"I typically wear a 26 in jeans and in these i got the 25 and they fit perfectly. i ordered the 25 because i wanted a more fitted look and that was what i got. they are well made, a nice dark wash and with the size 25 a more straight fit and not boyfriend fit. i'm only 5'3"" so they come a little past my ankle when unrolled. i've worn them two days in a row and they haven't stretched out...highly recommend.",5
I usually wear a 27 in pilcro and for these i have to size down to a 26. the 27 was very large in the waist. they are a great dark denim color and look cute with the bottoms rolled up a little.,5
Much softer fabric than i expected. wrinkles easily.,5
"I love, love, love this top! it is beautiful and very unique. the first day i wore it i got so many compliments! highly recommend!",5
"I was so looking forward to receiving this in the mail! when it arrived, i was very disappointed. the color is more mauve than dusty pink, and the fabric is stiff and wrinkled.....not at all what i expect velvet to be (flowy and soft). the fabric seems very cheap for the price point.  i usually like floreat, but this one is headed right back to the store!",1
"I tried this sweater on and  loved it immediately! it's super soft and comfortable, and very slimming. i tried my normal size s and an xs, and decided on the xs as the s gave it (and me!) a bit of a wider look. love the navy color!",5
"A 3-season top that compliments jeans, dress pants, shorts & skirts. light-weight and double layered (so should you go without a bra the girls have protection). emphasizes nice shoulders, length just covers any belly flaws. i'm a 6-8 and could have gone small or medium here.",5
"This top when pulled out of the box didn't look like much, the contrast of the buttons, wrinkly, shapeless... but, when i shook it out, tried it on i fell in love. it's so simple and versatile. prob the best white shirt i purchased this year, i'd say it pretty flowly, but that's the style and i love it. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small. i would purchase again, and in other colors if they had them.",5
"I bought a medium, my usual size, and had to exchange for a small. i love flowy sweaters, but this one truly fits one size big. the arms and body of the sweater fit larger. beautiful sweater with jeans or legging- can't wait to wear!",5
"Love this top, it looks just as pictured. the lilac color is just as it looks, which i am happy about. sometimes this shade ends up darker than it appears online, but not with this top. it is soft velvet, silky lining and hits right where it does on model. i got a pxs my usual size. i am 5'3. the neck is a bit tight once buttons are buttoned up, but again this is pictured. well made and very pretty. can dress up or down.",5
"This blouse is the definition of how to wear plaid and not feel like a lumberjack.. living in l.a. it's 90 degrees one day, and 60 the next. the lightweight fabric is perfect for our ever changing climate. it runs true to size and is very comfy. thinking of wearing it for thanksgiving dinner.",5
"I do not think i could express how much i love this top! it is so flattering and soft. i love that the bottom half is slightly sheer and a different fabric than the top. it is stretchy, which for me is a wonderful thing. i purchased the day it came in store. it is quickly prone to pilling though!! with the style of shirt it's not so bad, but kind of unfortunate for a top that is almost $100.",5
"I reserve my 5 star reviews for products that are made well, are a good value and have great style. this is one of those rare gems!

the top is just beautiful in person. very lightweight, almost voile-like cotton, so soft and drapey (and yes, you will need a base layer, it's meant to be very sheer) and the crochet and lace insets all over the top are stunning. 

the fit is somewhere between tts and slightly oversized, but the shoulders are pretty tts which means it avoids looking like you're",5
"I feel like i have a lot of blouses like this so it really needed to wow me to keep it. and while it is lovely, well made and very pretty and delicate...i just didn't feel like it was anything special. if you don't have a blouse like this, then it is a great find. but it is nothing super out of the ordinary... fit i feel is tts...i am in between a m and l...i ordered the l. lots of room in the body although i didn't like where the arms hit on me. they aren't wrist length but they aren't mid-fore",5
"I found this skirt in a size 8 at my local retailer store. i admired it on the website but to see and feel it in person was very appealing. i tried it on and it fit beautifully, a style that looks great on my figure. i love the mohair weave of the color block sections. the negative is this skirt is really pricy but i had my birthday discount and since the size 8 was sold out online and this skirt must have been a return the chances of it going on sale in a size 8 were very slim. i am still admirin",5
"This sweater looks exactly as represented in the picture. the detail on the cuffs, neckline and hemline make it unique and set it apart from the typical patterned sweater. i've worn it twice already and i'm very pleased.",5
"I was drawn to this sweater for its vibrant colours and unique pattern. i tried it on and immediately fell in love with the comfort, quality, and design. it is a little short, but this minor issue is easily fixed with by wearing a neutral colored undershirt/camisole. the cuffed sleeves reveal a matching pattern and can be rolled down or up. i usually wear a xs or s in retailer's clothes, but i sized up to a m on this one. definitely worth it. this is a festive winter piece that can be dressed up o",5
"I was so excited for this to arrive. at the end of last summer, my favorite shirt (you know the kind - dresses up or down with ease - it's your go to for work or a night out with friends) was ruined and i have been searching for the perfect replacement. i thought that this would be a good contender, but i was ever so disppaointed when i opened the bag...

firstly, the base color is not accurately represented in the photograph - in person its more of a peachy off-whte instead of white. still pr",1
"This is a very flattering blouse, but it should be noted that holding horses tends to run large in size, so order down. the fabric is 100% cotton, gauzy and light. it is very soft on the skin. i was a bit uncertain whether to keep it at first because it required a bit of adjusting in the way it falls once on, but i decided to keep it and i'm glad i did. it is nice looking with jeans and leggings because the back of the blouse is longer, and because of the lightness of the fabric, it does not app",5
Finding boyfriend jeans that actually look flattering can be tricky. these fit the bill! not too baggy with a lovely side view silhouette and a front silhouette that does not make you look larger than you actually are - i instantly knew that i had to have these. look supercute with the legs rolled up or as shown in the picture. the denim is soft and the creasing and finish do not look too contrived. i sized down a size and the fit is perfect. highly recommend!,5
This shirt is so comfortable and flattering. the quality is really good but i would definitely size down. it's not too heavy and can be worn with skinny jeans/jeggings..,5
"Now that i have this dress in my life i think my wardrobe is done.  there is nothing but love for this dress as it hits all the correct points:  great fit, flattering silhouette, comfortable fabric, shape enhancing cut, and the easiest casual style ever!  i got the 10p and my body is 5'3"" 140# 36dd",5
"This is one of the softest blouses i now own. it feels and wears like a premium blouse. i love it, and it actually makes my backside look smaller too. even though it is flowy, it is true to size. if you have small arms and a chest than you could go down a size. this is one of my new favorite purchases, and i wear it with the cabled knit bomber and boots.",5
"This anorak is perfection! perfect weight, color, and the style is super easy to wear. i found this to fit true to size and not oversized at all. i'm 5""3, 130lbs, 32d with an average build/frame and i took a size small. i can comfortably wear a long sleeved shirt underneath or even a thin sweater. i think xs would have been too tight in the shoulders/bust. it fits perfectly and i love the inner drawstrings that you can pull to give it a little more shape. i got this during the 30% off promo!",5
I love this top! the top has nice details and is not too sheer. it did have a smell at first but that's gone now.,5
Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!,5
"This is a subtle, classy shirt. i'm 5'7, 122 lbs and an xs fit perfectly. shirts like these, that don't fit snugly on my back cover my poor posture (genetic) and make me look like i am standing up straight. nice!",5
I am a petite person with broad shoulders and got this in a size small. i absolutely love it! it is similar to how it looks online but is even better in person. you could wear this with just about anything. so glad i bought it.,5
"This is an awesome bra! it has a reinforced cup underneath (although not an underwire), which i like. i was a little worried that it'd be huge, as i'm on the smaller side of the natori 36b in other bras, but it fits well and seems like it would accommodate b or c cup ladies. the lace is pretty and it is well made. i want more colors!",5
"I tried on this skirt in stores and loved it. the only thing is, i'm usually a 2 or a 26 and had to buy a 6. for reference, i'm 5' 7 and about 120 pounds. if you want to tuck a light sweater or really anything in, i'd recommend you go up a size as well!",5
I ended up ordering this in a petite online after trying it on in store. i found the regular length to be a bit too long and flowy and i preferred it to be more tailored. it's very cute and on trend. can't wait to wear it with some dark flare jeans!,5
"This is a great casual skirt, i ordered the 0p or xs petite and it fit perfectly. both colors are nice, i don't think i could choose though i do have a taupe skirt, so leaning towards the slate color. the fit is also flattering, waist is snug, but not tight. the fabric is soft, could wear in the fall or even winter with tights. i recommend... (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist)",5
"Like most of the other reviewers, i agree this skirt runs quite small. i had to size up 2 sizes. the waist is quite small (but there are parts that are elasticized (nicely hidden)) and the skirt flares nicely and maintains a structured yet flowing drape. i bought the skirt in both colors and it looks great both with and without the tie. i think it will work nicely year round, too.",5
"Love this skirt! the material is so soft and flowy, but holds a nice a-line shape. i do agree with the other reviewers that this does run a bit small. i am a 26"" waist and purchased a 4... and i could probably have considered sizing up to the 6 easily as well.",5
"I love the colors. originally purchased a large for my broad shoulders and it was too big and too long for 5'4"". exchanged it for a petit medium and it fits great. will have to wait for cooler days to wear it since it is a heavy cotton and the weather is still very hot intexas.",5
Really pretty top. very different colors and style = nothing like anything i have. delivered in timely manner. highly recommend.,5
"I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress, but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift, and she was right. not worth the price on sale.",1
Love this skirt! i did have to get one size larger than usual but the length was perfect on me and i love the color (i got the slate).can be dressed up or down.,5
Saw this in my local and retailer store and had to have it! well made and easy to dress up for down. perfect with a light weight shirt tucked in for summer and early fall. i recommend sizing up one size.,5
"I bought this skirt in my local store when it first came out. i have to say it is one of my best retailer purchases ever. fits beautifully. works with a tee, tank, denim shirt, and more! i get so many compliments every time i wear it. will be wearing for many summers to come! runs tts. i am 5'10"", 155 pounds and the 8 fit perfectly. it is not too short for work, but my legs do need to be tan to wear it.",5
Such a cute skirt. it has a touch of whimsy with this tropical flare that makes me feel pretty. it fits well and it is true to size.,5
I was so excited to get this in the mail... and loved everything about it except for the fact that it was only as long as one inch above my navel! i don't know why it looks like a normal length on the model. im returning it.,1
"My review is of the ""black motif"" (no longer listed online, but i saw a bunch in the clearance sock bin at the georgetown dc store, today, 12/27/2015).

i love beautiful and unique socks! so i thought i'd give these a chance. i like them so much that i bought 3 more pairs of the exact same sock now that they're on sale!

two things i noticed... the way the sock is knit, when you put it on, it no longer has a matte black look in the black areas. it is sort of a stretched, slightly two-tone look.",5
These are the best jeans ever! never wore pilcros before and only ordered them because they were on sale. so glad i did! now i'm hooked!,5
"I gave this top 5 stars for the embroidery and fit around the chest/shoulders. i wish this top was a little longer as the xsmall was just too short. (i'm 5'6"" and run long-waisted.) the small fit better in length...the way it does on the model.",5
I am so glad that i got this sweater.it is just perfect!,5
"Skirt fits true to size, i bought a regular size 2 even though im only 5 feet because i didnt want it too short. the size was perfect as it hit right above the knee. bold, vibrant color and great quality! also very unique, which is what i look for at ahtro. recommend, give it a shot!",5
"After a rough day at the office, i went into my local retailer to seek out some retail therapy. i stumbled upon this skirt and knew i had to try it on. though it's more than i normally like to spend, it was well worth the price. material is lightweight and comfortable yet substantial enough for work. fit is spot on (i have wider hips and a smaller waist, which typically makes me a size 12 and that's what i bought). the color is a gorgeous mustard yellow that can be paired with all sorts of colors,",5
"With a skirt so vibrant, it's hard not to feel happy wearing it. i tried this on in store, following a spring fashion show. while i usually need petite sizes for length/proportion purposes (i'm 5'4, slender build), the regular size 2 was a great fit and length. any shorter and it may have taken a bit of the elegance away from the skirt (and i don't necessarily mind a shorter length, but this was beautiful as it was). the price is a bit steep, but the quality of the material justifies it. the one",5
"It's absolutely beautiful! it's a bit more than what i want to pay for a skirt but it's worth every penny. i'm a true size 4, 130 lbs and 5'4"" and it fits perfect. very versatile.",5
"I have a gala to attend next weekend and can't wait to wear this beautiful cape. i'm a big fan of nanette lepore
clothing and this cape does not disappoint. it is absolutely beautiful....chic and elegant.",5
"I love this skirt for so many reasons! 
one, it isn't a circle skirt, per se, which is good. i am hip heavy and don't need extra volume at my hips. so while it's called a circle skirt, the description states that it's a-line. based on that, i was willing to risk it. also, i am 55 and tend to stay away from above the knee dress and skirt lengths (just my personal preference). although i am only 5'2"" i ordered the regular size 10 for the extra length and it's exactly at my knee; perfect for me.",5
Beautiful skirt! dress up or down! colors are lovely and enable one to wear many different tops. lightweight. perfect for casual or summertime work.,5
"To be honest, i bought this sweater as an add-on so i could get free shipping; however, it's the only piece i actually kept from the order! this sweatshirt is warm (fleece-lined) and just the right amount of billow. but the best part is the subtle lavender color; when i ordered it, i didn't even realize i ordered lavender (again, i wasn't paying much attention to this piece!), but the color and texture are so soft...definitely a must buy! for reference, i am 5'3, 110 pounds and the xs (my usual",5
"I love these socks so much! i ordered the beige and red pair with the polar bear design and they are my new favorite socks. these are comfy, with great stretch and just the right amount of cushion. however, the best feature is the cute little frill around the cuff! i want to order more, but i don't care for the other designs as much as the pair i ordered. instead, i will be keeping an eye on this brand to see what they come out with next!",5
I tried on an 8 and a 10 and both worked perfecto. the 10 had just a tiny bit more room to tuck in a shirt with.,5
"I'm 5'3, i ordered the petite (nice to have this option), the length/volume doesn't overwhelm me as some kimonos do. this feels more like a fall-season kimono due to the fabric content. it is not a wispy fabric, there's weight and some stiffness to the drape, you can see on the model how the fabric stands away from her body. it's a different look from silky feeling kimonos that hug the body. a rich blend of blue, black, white, subtle tan, maybe some silver grey - hard to tell, the colors look li",5
"Had been eyeing this for a while. print is beautiful in person, just as pictured. tts fit (size 8, 5'7"", 150#, pear shaped). comes within a couple inches of my knees so long enough to wear to work.",5
"Fabulous colors, great fabric, super comfy and extremely versatile. i love, love, love this skirt. although i'm only 5'1"", the regular 2 was still above my knee so it might be a bit short for really tall gals. the waistband is a bit wide, but with a cropped top or tying a button down as shown, i found it very flattering. love the texture of the fabric and the slightly retro print and it doesn't seem to wrinkle (after getting out the original packaging creases). it honestly goes with everything a",5
I love this cozy and comfy top. it is oversized as the name says and implies - but i normally wear an xs in most retailer tops and i chose to get a small - and i'm glad i did. it is boxy and oversized - but also short. the small is perfect for me and it really feels so cozy as is - and big enough to wear a tee or tank under it and not fee clingy.,5
As a texas girl growing up with cheap hand embroidered tops from mexico - this is a treat and takes that style to a new level. quality fabric and workmanship in a unique sleeveless design! perfection.,5
"Aside from the beautiful colors what drew me to this skirt is the wide waistband! i love that it can hold in a bit of a tummy and accommodate a belt (or not). when i received this in the mail a few days ago i immediately started pulling articles of clothing out of my closet to go with the skirt - a striped tee, chambray top, belt, denim jacket. the quality is great and it has pockets. i have a 30"" waist and went with my usual size 8. i am 5'5"" and ordered a petite. so it hits a couple inches abo",5
Fits like a maternity top. not for my age group or build.,1
"After reading the reviews, i decided to size up to a m (instead of a small). so glad i did - the arms are a tad long, but other than that it fits perfectly. love this in yellow :).",5
"I love this skirt. i usually don't buy skirts of this cut because they make me look hippy. but the fabric is so lightweight and flowing, and yet it has structure. the colors are great and go with many top options. i wear it to work and casual outings. it is my favorite clothing article in my closet right now.",5
This skirt is perfection. i am 5'8 130ibs and the 2 fit perfect. the picture does not even do it justice. it is much more softer than i thought it would be. in the picture it seems stiff looking but that is not the case at all. can't wait to wear this skirt for the summer. you can dress it up with a nice blouse and heels or keep it casual with a relaxed tee and sandals. i will defiantly get a lot of use out of this piece!,5
"It's a sweatshirt that isn't typically sweatshirt looking. first, it's spacedye. then there's the hi-lo hem. it's mock neck and it's wide neck. sleeves are low and cocoon-y. it's oversize in looks but not overwhelming. i love that i can throw this on over jeans or leggings, step into a pair of flats or trainers, whip my hair up into a bun and head out without looking too sloppy.",5
"This is a super cute tank- fits good, flowy and airy which is exactly what i had in mind for summer. fits good.",5
"This sweater is a great, comfy fall or winter sweater. in several of the pictures the neck is folded down, so beware that the neck has a bit of a turtleneck/mock neck look to it. it can be folded down if that's not the look you're going for. cute sweater!",5
"I love everything about this top. it is high volume and looks good with either a skinny pant or a structured voluminous pant. very sharp, but feminine and frilly look. i love the juxtaposition.",5
"Love this top. comfy, soft, and a great length. slightly longer in the back, and works great with leggings or jeans. i love that is has long sleeves. i wish it came in more colors.",5
"Just grabbed this today! great find. i paired it with a white blouse with blue polka dots....will pair with anything though, with great neutral colors. white or blue jean jackets, sweaters....the skirt has a little stretch for my hourglass figure, but would work with any type body i think. a many season skirt, perfect for traveling.",5
I got this for my daughter (teen) who had been wanting this plaid look but didn't want to look like a lumberjack! this is feminine and can be dressed up or down. it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable! she will get a lot of use out of this purchase! new item but black friday discount! yay! purchased in red color.,5
This is a great dress if you don't want to leave the house or you want the world to see your nipples.,1
I wore this dress for my small winter wedding and it was perfect! i thought it ran a little large though because i had to return it 2 times to get the right size! once i got the right size it fit perfectly. i loved the champagne color and shine.,5
Very flattering dress in a comfortable material. the cut is perfectly placed. this is very long. i'm 5'11 and in flats this touches the floor. easily dressed up or down with the tight accessories.,5
"If you are on the shorter side, do with the petite size. i ordered both (at first, petite was sold out) so glad i got to get it. i looked lost in the regular size, the back length was well below my bum. both colors are really nice, but i did end up with the orange one, more ""dressy"", red one looked more calsual (though it is a casual shiryt, i had on trousers, and hte orange looked nice with them).",5
"I loved the color and design until i tried it on in the store. i am 5'5"" with a slender build. i tried my usual xs but couldn't manage to put this shirt on me without risking smear my makeup or scratch my face by the elastic band at the neckline. the band is so small even fully stretched out. i have a normal sized head just in case you wonder... i gave up after wrestling with it. i can only imagine how uncomfortable to wear something with a tight elastic band choking me...funny... but not funny.",1
I love this shirt. it is great quality and hangs perfectly! please make more colors in this one. i would buy all of them!!,5
"I bought this shirt because i needed something lighter to where in autumn and needed to layer. i wasn't expecting so much out of a tshirt. the material is great. it's comfy and oh so flattering on any figure. i ordered the green one, and it was greener in person than online, but a very lovely color. it layers great, and is longer than expected. almost dress length. i'm not a tights wearer, but it would definitely go great with tights or leggings, and it worked fabulously under a wrap. great prod",5
"Love this top! a new take on traditional flannel. yes it is pricey for flannel, yes it is not thick like a traditional flannel shirt but it is feminine, sexy, comfortable....even my husband liked it on me. i ordered a regular small, wish i would've went for a petite x-small, however they are sold out. regardless i am keeping :-) for reference i am 5'3, 110-115 and the small is definitely roomy.",5
"Great top - i have both colors. because the front is 'short' i ordered a medium. i usually wear a small. if you are not long waisted, like me, order the small.",5
This is an amazing looking skirt. it has such an exciting pattern on it and is very flattering. it is very light weight though....almost flimsy. but...it is not a deal breaker. i wear it and love it!,5
"I took a chance on this in green, extra small (one size smaller than my normal size) because that was all that was left and i thought i could wear it under another sweater. no, it's too awesome to waste as a liner. it's the most amazing cut and fabric. it so flattering and so soft.

please bring back this top!!!!",5
"I love this for a casual winter day. the fabric is so soft. the draping gives it a unique look. so cozy and nice. it's a bit big, though. opt to size down.",5
This is a gorgeous buttondown. the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown. the fabric is super soft and drapes just right. i feel the this shirt runs true to size. i'm an xxs petite and it fit perfect. this one is a winner!,5
"Got this top in the blue/orange plaid. its super cute and i love the style much better than your typical straight button down plans shirt.
i highly recommend it!",5
One can't tell from the picture but the top shoulder part is sheet and transparent. it also is very long almost dress length.  feels less quality than what retailer usually carries.,1
"I feel in love with this piece. the color are gorgeous and i received so many compliments. it lifted my mood just wearing it! sadly, ut the end of the first wear i had a run up the front and by the middle of the second wear the light fabric got caught on something and a hole developed. upon further inspection i found another hole at the top where the price tag must have been attached. i also noticed all over pilling after the first wear! so sad! they should recreate this in a heavy fabric.",1
My favorite for work or going out. the perfect black shirt.,5
"I generally don't write bad reviews, but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost. the design and colors are great, but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer's tag is at the back of the neck. the material is very thin, so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment. i shop at retailer all the time, and this is not a $98 item of clothing.",1
"Love retailer's kimonos and when i saw this pattern i had to have it! unfortunately, when i bought it the tag was already showing holes so they gave me 15% off... went to wear it for the first time, there was already a huge snag in it! i love retailer but for 98$ this is not worth your money.",1
"The colors on this kimono are amazing and i really loved it, however, i too noticed the 'delicateness' of the material. it is so delicate that parts were starting to fray - including next to the kimono's label. so sad.",1
"At first, i thought that this sweater would be too thin and show any imperfections, but it doesn't. the vertical ribbing really gives it a slimming effect and it is a perfect lightweight cover up that goes with pretty much anything.",5
This is an amazingly soft and gorgeous sweater. i typically avoid this brand because most of their pieces run smaller on my frame however this not only fit perfect but it is a beautiful color as well! i prefer transitional pieces that can be worn multiple seasons and this one is just right.,5
"This sweater is much prettier in person than in the picture. the colors are soft and feminine. medium fit me perfectly. this is the soft, cuddly sweater i have been looking for.",5
"This is a great top. i love how it's loose and hangs away from my body but is banded at the bottom so it isn't shapeless. the tie at the neck is cute and gives it some personality.

i usually bounce between a s or xs. i tried the xs in the store but ordered the s.",5
I love this top! fits great n is elegant. great for the workplace n a night out. absolutely beautiful! quality fabric. love love love!,5
I love this shirt! lightweight and versatile! perfect for all seasons,5
"Love this shirt! looks great with a pair of black work slacks or with jeans. very flattering with the banded hem, and the material is soft.",5
Great fit,5
Crazy soft and comfy.  light weight so will be great for spring/ summer and layering.  so happy i bought it.,5
"If you're looking for a sweater that's super soft and comfortable, you've found it! you could wear this almost anywhere except for a dressy occasion, but then, of course, you wouldn't wear it with a dress anyway. i wish it came in other colors because i'd buy several. it's on the thin side but not too thin. the only thing that i should mention is that it's not a black black but more of a faded or brownish black which is really obvious with black leggings or jeans.",5
"From the images, it looks like a basic black cardigan. look again because it's a beautiful fabric and can be dressed up or down. i'm 5""1 and always wear an xsmall at retailer however i thought it to wear over other articles vogue clothing i'd size up. it fits perfect i did an xsmall petite and couldn't be happier",5
"This top fits perfect everywhere except the sleeves are a little tight. not uncomfortably so but i wish they had just a little more room so they looked like they did in the picture. other than that, i love this shirt! its super cute and comfy and i have gotten a few compliments on it!",5
It is soft and hangs great. problem - i wore it one time - and the back balled up terrible. it looked like i had owned it for years - not worn it one time. wouldn't recommend. though it is sooooo soft!,1
Love the softness and the length. the color was perfect. but you have be be a very skinny almost boney person for you to not show imperfections to your body. the fabric is not thick enough and does not have the give to over shadow normal imperfections. will be returning the sweater.,1
"I got these in gray and ultimately returned them only because i already have a similar pair of pants. they fit true to size and the quality is fantastic. i usually do poorly with pants that zip on the side because of my small frame, but i had no problem with these at all. i may go after the other colors!",5
The tie neck is super on trend. this will go great under a jacket or cardi. it's a keeper.,5
This blouse is so pretty! i love the neck tie which gives it interest and won't look boring on it's own. i'll wear this all-year round. i ordered an xxs which fits perfect.,5
"I ordered an extra small. it fits with both a humble tee and a button down with the sleeves rolled up. i've tried it with jeans and also joggers and heels. really a cute and versatile sweater. i got the olive but can see where the black might be more universally useful. this one works perfectly for me, however",5
"Love this top! love that it ia jersey knit which makes it comfortable. love the print which makes it stand out. love the design of a side bow. i did not have an issue with the banded hem, in fact i like how it makes the top more structured.",5
"Really cute skirt, love that it has hidden pockets in the front. ended up just being a bit too wide on me. can't size down as fits everywhere else. will look great on someone, just not me! order true to size, fits great.",5
"I have a few pair of charlie's and one thing i really like about them is their consistent fit. i own this pair in both the orange and gray, bought both in my normal 4. they will stretch so if they are a little snug at try on don't size up. definitely recommend these pants.",5
I got the moss color in this cardigan. i'm not sure why these aren't sold out because it is pretty amazing! it is super soft and is a cute addition to a casual outfit. i would say that for this price it's definitely worth the buy!,5
"Ordered in the orange and they are so cute i had to order the other two colors. my normal size 12 fit tts. i am happy with the fabric, fit and color. i have an athletic build and had no issues with the side zip, waist, hip or thighs.",5
This tunic is a wonderfully updated look. it's cinched just a tad at the waist which gives it a great line. i paired it with a pair of citizens of humanity crop jeans. terrific look!!,5
"I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past, and i've never been disappointed with quality, style, or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering. i got these in a 4, my usual size, and the fit is perfect. i also got these in the regular, rather than petite, but the length works just fine for my height. i bought these in the grey stripe, but like them so much i think i'll order another pair in the orange.",5
This cardigan looked great on line but it is one of the worst things i ever ordered at retailer. the quality is awful and the material feels flimsy and cheap.,1
"Although i haven't worn it yet, it is very soft and functional. i will watch how i wash it so it stays that way.",5
"I love this top! i debated between an xs and a s, but i'm usually an xs in deletta so that's what i got. it fits perfectly and is beautiful.",5
"Ordered this dress online and hoped for the best, because there wasn't a size chart to reference. i'm usually in between a size small and a medium, i ordered the size small and it fit well. for a more flowy look i would have gone with the medium.
everything about this dress is soft, i love it! even the ribbon is delicate, soft and made of quality material. the lining feels like heaven. 

this dress goes to the floor on me - i'm 5' 7"" - i was expecting it to be more mid ankle length, but i sti",5
"Soft pretty socks. a little big if you have smaller feet. i'm a size 7.5, and they are a tad too big but still comfortable.",5
"After reading the reviews, stating that this dress was a tent and only fit for the tall and small chested, i kind of had a battle of wills in my head over ordering it. it is very ""me,"" but me is also 5'5, curvy, and possessing a 36g bust. i had to post a review, because i received the dress today, and i actually love it. i ordered a 16 and i love the fit. i know it's flowy, but on me, it's far from tent-like. i think it's great now as a pre-fall piece with some sandals and a jean jacket, and as",5
Agree with other reviewers the jacket is better in person than on model very nice jacket model does it no justice,5
This is seriously a beautiful dress. it has such gorgeous colors. it's lined so no slip needed. it is flowy and just the right length. i went with a petite and it is perfect.. can't wait to use it at the beach.,5
Love this shirt. i can dress it up or down. great fit,5
"This may be the ugliest dress with the worst fit i have ever tried. the blue stripes are brighter than they appear in the photo, absolutely garish. the top is baggy with awful beads on the back ties, it just looks cheap. the skirt is an antebellum nightmare.  
i did not even want to try it on, it's that bad. i considered adding a photo, but was too horrified.
for reference, i'm 5'10"", approximately the height/ size of the model, but it was shorter than the photo depictes. i wanted to like it,",1
"Thought this would be a great dress for warm days, but alas it fit like a sack. love floreat and have a few of their well made dresses. shame this did nothing for my curves. ordered an 8, usually wear a 10 and it was a tad narrow in the shoulders. if you can sport a loose swingy shape, this is a great dress with nice detailing, but sadly the shape did not work for me.",1
"I am not a model shape but this dress looked so light and beautiful i had to try it. it wasn't available in my local store so i risked it and ordered online. i'm 5'6"" and about 175 lbs; the medium fits perfectly. i will say that the skirt fabric comes much more sharply pleated than it looks in the photos, maybe this hangs out/mellows over time. the lining to the knee is going to be great for warm summer days. can wear to work with a shrug and some flats or to a summer wedding. the pattern is bea",5
This dress is very cute and screams summer. the stripped skirt adds dimension. true maxi length. effortless and fun!,5
"A perfectly fun pant for a gray or sunny, winter day. i like the longer length, to the ankle on me, pairing with my kate spade black sabina combat boots and a eileen fisher black cashmere, boxy, cropped sweater. another fun option is to pull out the pink accent in the pant with a pink camisole under a black sweater. the fabric weight is good for winter, they do feel a little itchy at first but it's not noticeable after wearing them a short while.",5
"Don't be fooled by the photos online. the color is a bright baby blue, not pale blue. it's a beautifully designed dress, however, the material is so bulky and heavy. it's so unflattering. i was afraid to try it on and my fears came true: this dress just hung on me and pulled me down. i wanted so much to love it, but i returned it.",1
"I love this blazer. its perfect for work, and makes a great statement.",5
"When i received this dress i was surprised by the weight of the fabric. it's not as light and gauzy as the photos appear, and it is fully lined. it's more substantial in a good way. also i had thought it would be more of a straight cut but it's definitely a swing which i prefer. with the lining, it does stand out a bit from your body so it's not a clingy look at all. i like it a lot but i don't think it fits the way you would expect from the photo. it's roomy, i could probably have sized down. i",5
"I found this dress to be a perfect flowy fit for the super-hot tail end of summer. this definitely is not a form fitting dress, but i bought my regular size medium (size 6) and think it fits perfectly. i have a pretty small chest and find that sometimes these a-line dresses look better if you don't have a lot on top making them ""tent out"". just my opinion. personally do not think it has an abundance of fabric. in fact, it is a lot less roomy than a lot of others in this cut due to the embroidery",5
"I should have listened to previous reviewers. but the dress looks so good on the model in the two dimensional pictures. when it arrived in the mail, i realized this is a mistake. it has no shape, material is poofy and feels cheap. it is going back.",1
"I chose this dress for my engagement photoshoot and i'm so glad i did! it is beyond beautiful, my favorite dress ever!",5
"I usually wear a 4, but ordered a 2 & 0 because of the previous reviews. the 2 fit perfectly. the 0 was too snug across the shoulders. both sizes were the same length and width except the shoulders.the material is beautiful and seems very well made. i am thrilled with this purchase.it looks exactly like the photo.",5
"This is so close to perfect, but there's a seam down the middle of the back and they didn't bother to match the polka dots. you can see the mismatch in the second photo. i was about to buy the jacket, and totally in love, when i turned and saw the error. i hoped it was one bad match, but nope, on every one. couldn't unsee, didn't buy. very disappointed.",1
"This tank caught my eye when it first came out couple of months ago, love the colors and the embroidery especially. the colors on top beautifu and it will complement any skin tone and the bottom is neutral so that this top will go with any bottom. this flows too goes great with skinny jeans and flats or put a strappy heels on and it's perfect for evening outings.",5
"This dress is so different from any you normally see and its gorgeous. the blue on bottom is actually a much brighter blue in person than in the pictures on the site. the dress pleats along every blue line, so when you walk, it's as if the dress changes colors with every movement. it's fully lined so nothing shows underneath and it's just really beautiful. i also like how the back opens, but not all the way down, so you can wear a strapless bra without the back showing. 
but the sizing was a bi",5
I completely agree with the other reviewers this top is easy to throw on with jeans or trousers and so comfy! i'm 5'3 with a 34ddd chest and i ordered in my normal medium which looks fantastic. and if i wanted to i think i could have sized down for a more form flattering look but i love the ease of this top.,5
"I bought these and returned them almost immediately. the material looks nice, but itchy and heavy. the fit is too small and just uncomfortable to wear.",1
"Love the simple, casual elegance of this coat. i especially love the colors, grey & beige, because it looks great with my grey jeans as well as my dressier beige pants. i will get a lot of use from this coat.",5
Beautiful dress! wanted something different. even bought the hat ! very flattering.,5
"Just bought this in the store a couple days ago and wore it for the first time today. love the embroidery detail and i feel that the colors are more vibrant in person. i typically wear a 2 in most retailer tops but i got a 0 in this and it is great - seems to be a generous fit. the slits on the sides do come up a bit high, but i wore a cami underneath since it is sheer and the slits were not an issue with it. looks great with jeans. it is a great transitional piece for the fall as i'm sure i will",5
"Just got this and i haven't taken it off all night.  i feels like lounge wear, but is so cute and works with heels or flats.  throw a necklace on, a nice scarf or a jacket and dress it up for going out.  it looks exactly like the picture and fits true to size.  i will get a lot of use out of this piece for spring and summer.  nothing is better than something that feels like pjs but looks so stylish!!",5
"This dress is absolutely beautiful! i wore it in my engagement photos and it is so flowy and so beachy. you can dress it up or down and it's very comfortable as well. unfortunately, it got ocean water on it in my photos, so i took it to the dry cleaners and they lost it :-( hopefully it will come back in stock and i can buy it again. it is easily my favorite dress i have owned in quite some time. for tall people - it may be too short to wear with anything but flats. i'm 5'6"" and wore sandals and",5
"This is a very flattering top. i'm pretty flat-chested & this top doesn't look too bad. i love the subtle peplum - it makes it a bit dressy. i'm 5'4"", 112 lbs & got the xs.",5
"Love this top, you can really fess up, i ordered in a small i am 5 7 and 154 pounds",5
"I usually wear size 4 for dress, but this is the first time ever i have to go down to size 0, and it fits perfectly. well made, maybe a bit stiff around armholes, nothing major. i love the length as i don't like to show my knees. great color combinations, although this supposed to be a summer dress, it looks great for fall, just need to add a jacket, a pair of boots and i'm good to go, feeling pretty!",5
"Runs true to size, with allowance for some bulky clothing underneath for those cool fall days. definitely not meant for winter - so don't plan on this for freezing cold days. the bottom falls nicely over the hips and the color is vibrant and adds some life to any outfit.",5
"Very much in love with this ethereal, delicate dress. the silk is very light and slightly clingy, so take caution when wearing. the belt can be adjusted as modeled or you can get creative as there is length the play with. the liner finishes above the knee on me in medium petite. those of slender torsos and small busts may want to size down, otherwise tts. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#",5
"For reference i am 5'5 about 140lb, typically wear a size 6. luckily they had it in-store around me so i as able to try it on. i read the reviews and first tired on a size down, but it still didn't look quite right on me. i was daring and tried on another size down, and i'm glad i did! there is no lie that it runs large! it's a beautiful dress and heavy enough to wear into the fall! i will say it does still have a little ""tenty"" shape to it, but it's just the style of the dress.",5
"Fully lined until just above the knee, silk exterior, rayon lining. can dress it up or down. very lightweight and cool-feeling. this is a beautiful dress. i'm 5'9 and it fit great-- shorter people might need to alter it. i tried it on in the store and felt like a princess, but am hoping it goes on sale.",5
This dress drapes very well and is flattering to many different body shapes. the colors give it the flexibility to wear from summer into fall. gorgeously designed!,5
"Love, love, love this silk dress. i feel classic retailer is back! perfect for hot and steamy summer days.

just a few photos of the back, which has the belt band sewn in kind of high so that it can be wrapped through the side loops, grecian style. for some reason, in the online back photo, the model is wearing the dress backwards.

"As much as i buy from retailer, this is my first review. the pictures do not accurately show how large this dress is in person. i wanted something that was a bit flowy, but this was a reminder of little house on the prairie. the most unflattering dress ever and since it's only available online, i'm not interested enough to try a smaller size.",1
I bought this dress as a surprise for my daughter. she was very happy with it.,5
"As the previous reviewer stated, this wrap is over sized but that is the style. the knit is soft and dense and the metallic accents are subtle and lovely. this is an heirloom piece that will last for many, many years.",5
"I tried this top on thinking it would be cute for the summer. it looked more like a maternity top with the fullness in the bottom. so if you're expecting, this one would be great.",1
"This top is great under a blazer for work, can be tucked into a skirt and looks great with jeans.necklaces work great with this neckline unless they are short. the sea green is wonderful! i like the snug armholes but may be a problem for some. my hips are larger than my bust so i had to be convinced to try this on and i'm glad i was overruled. i am a small or medium in retailer tops and i got a small.",5
Love love love this mock tank!!! goes fabulous with everything! it's flows nicely the mock neck looks fantastic! you can probably go one size down.,5
Such a great classic top! very flattering! can be worn all year. i bought it in grey but think i'll need it in other colors!,5
I ordered the size xl and it fits me as it does on the model. it's true to size. it is made of a scratchier material but is still comfortable to wear. definitely needs a tank/cami underneath. i love the vintage look. it's worn well & washed well too. i'd love to see more versions in this same style. i'll get good use out of this in the summer and then will layer cardigans over it in the fall.,5
"Love the rushed sleeves, and the flower pattern on the side. t shirt is, however, a little thin, hence a bit sheer. but i loved it nonetheless... i saw the loose fit and decided ot order a size down (xxs petite) ad it is so flattering. going to keep it as i don't think petite is going to make it to sale... i think it will look very cute with my denim pencil skirt, jeans or other pants for casual days!",5
This t shirt is very beautiful. i absolutely love it. it is soft and flattering and gorgeous - perfect for work or play. i washed it in gentle cycle cold water. i meant to hang to dry but somehow it got in the dryer with towels. i was heart sick when i saw it in a crumpled ball. but it did not shrink nor wrinkle. wow!,5
"I usually get a large in tops that don't come in tall due to my long torso. thanks to the reviews on this one, i got the white top in a medium.  the medium fit perfectly.   it looked just like it does on the model and not like a maternity top at all.  the material is thick enough that the white wasn't see through.  i paired it with some crop skinny pants and a statement necklace and received many compliments on it.  the top is a little bland and needs some kind of jewelry to really make it.  oth",5
"Love this top, i would have bought two but the grey is sold out in my size. very comfortable and true to size.",5
"Great cut, super flattering! it does run a little big in my opinion though. i'm usually a medium/size 8 and i had to get a small.",5
This is a very comfortable top -versatile in that you can dress it up or down. i'm happy with it!,5
"This top is my new favorite. i ordered it on a whim, and oh boy am i glad!! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me, and once it arrived i couldn't wait to put it. once i put it on, i couldn't wait to show it off! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings, shorts, and sandals. such an easy, classic, simple shirt that i will probably wear too much.",5
"I purchased this tee in the neutral motif. i love it, it is comfortable and it's linen (my favorite fabric) it drapes well and the birds on branches with blossoms and fruit on the side are a beautiful understated touch.",5
"My husband saw this in the store while shopping with me and asked me to try it on. i don't normally go for patterns like this, but i thought it was cute and springy.

i tried on a large first, since i prefer to cover my belly and allow for my broad shoulders. (i'm tall, big boned and 175 pounds) the large actually stuck out funny at the bottom and didn't do much for my shape.

the medium, however was great! it was long enough to hide my belly and cover enough of my waistband that i wouldn't",5
"I bought all 3 colors and couldn't be happier. love the cut, fabric, and colors. the fabric is light enough to wear in the hot summer of charleston, sc but not so light that you can see thru it. i love flowing tops in the summer that don't stick to you and this cut does that and is flattering as well. i've already work with shorts and a skirt. both looked great. easy to accessorize.",5
"This shirt is beautiful.its very light weight and great summer tee. don't hesitate to buy this, you won't be disappointed.i usually don't buy t-shirts that are quite this pricey, but i knew it might not last till it went on sale.runs a bit large and since it is linen, it will likely stretch a bit.(i have not worn it yet)",5
This tee is so cute and well constructed. it's not a fabric that's going to wrinkle and pill eventually which i love. it runs tts and i like that it's thin but not to sheer that i need a camisole - just a nude bra!,5
"I saw this in my local store and i fell in love with the bird pattern flowing down the right side of the shirt. for me, i bought the xs and the fit was great. i usually take a true s. the sleeves have a pulled stitching running down them and the top has nice shaping and flare to it. it is a wonderful little tee! the fabric is linen and not as soft as cotton but in this case it is not an issue as the tee does not cling to you.",5
"This top was a great find! it has a beautiful print on the front and goes perfect with my olive green shorts, capris, and pants! it is slightly sheer but not so much as to need a cami underneath. fits true to size. i love it!",5
"I really like this top. while it looks somewhat like just a t-shirt, it is not. the fabric is light and soft, it has a great texture feel, it dioes not feel like a regular cotton shirt. the print is lovely. i am very pleased.",5
"I was unsure about this top at first because of reviews saying ""maternity""and this shirt can have that feel if you look at it from that point. i tried it again and the arm holes fit perfectly. it has a swing cut and a peplum style which brings lots of fabric and swing. it's not that it runs big it's supposed to swing/flow from body like many styles but the peplum adds bulk because it's a little thicker fabric. so i can see how some may think maternity because of all the fabric and cut, but i lov",5
"Listen up gals - buy every color before they disappear!!! this top is amazing. so flattering, incredible fabric, the colors are divine and the price is amazing! i am not one who wears peplum tops often if ever. a coworker of mine spotted this one in our store and told me as soon as i came in. i'm curvy - generally a l or xl on top and i have hips and a toosh. peplums can often either sit on my hips in an unflattering way, or look like a maternity top on me. this one is magic. hits a big longer,",5
"I ordered this top in the pretty, sea glass green color. it is adorable on! it's constructed from a nice thick cotton and has a billowy swing look if you are into that, which i am. the cut of the neckline gives it a cool 60's vibe. my only issue is that the arm holes are cut small. also note that because of the wider neckline, i found putting a necklace on squashed it in a strange way. i'm still keeping it because it is awesome in every other aspect. most likely i will just jazz it up with fun e",5
"I don't normally write reviews, but this shirt was so terrible, that i felt inspired. 

first off, the seam that is in both the front and back of the shirt is much more pronounced than in the photo. secondly, there is no shape whatsoever, unlike in the photo. it bells out like a tent. it honestly looks like a shirt you would buy if you were trying to appear pregnant when not. overall, this shirt is an insult to the female form. 

retailer, what is with all of these shapeless, frocks in cheap f",1
"I tried the ""neutral motif"" one on when it first came out. i didn't buy but it stayed on my mind b/c the colors were so pretty. i got it at sale on sale and am so happy i did! it is sheer but i think it would work fine in a casual setting without a tank as long as you have a skin tone bra. great buy and tts.",5
I have worn this beautiful and super comfy top a number of times since i purchased it. it can be casual or add a long necklace and dress it up. super versatile!!,5
I love this dress! it's so flattering and the length is perfect for me now that above the knee dresses are no longer flattering.,5
"5'7 145# (athletic) 34c. as info, got my usual m and this is everything the previous reviewers have said. the sleeves run long, a bit bunchy at the wrists & cuffing makes them look normal length . maybe it could be just the one i've received & i know its a tie waist, but when i move it opens as if the body is a tad small. it does fit like the photo but opens with ordinary movement. pull it tighter & double-knot it you say? it only reinforced my belief that i needed to size up. i re-ordered in a",5
"The textured marled stripes on this top are so soft and give this pullover the edge it needs. a few people have asked me where i bought this from and i've only worn it twice. fits like the photo- i'm 5'2"" 115lbs and bought the xs.",5
I love this sweater! the wool is soft and not itchy. it can be worn tied in the front as shown or tied in the back. pretty embrodering and very flattering.,5
"I really love this sweater. it is very flattering-especially in the back. and the color is very versatile so it can compliment virtually anything. the tie does not go all the way around the waste which took me a little getting used to, but it is not a problem for me. it is comfortable and keeps to the quality of other boiled wool products. just be careful washing it, i washed mine on hand cycle which is usually fine for everything-even cashmere. but this one didn't survive it. lesson learned, an",5
Size up!!! this dress is great quality and so flattering but tight in the arms and chest. ordered in my usual xs and will regretfully need to return it.,5
"This is a great white dress for summer.

i tried on a 4 in store and it was too big for me especially in the underarm area. when i tried on the 2, it fit perfectly. i almost felt like there should be a 3, ha ha, because it felt like it made more of a difference to downsize than i expected. that being said, i took the 2 home since it looked like it was tailored to fit my body (but not in a super tight way).

fyi, i'm not super curvy. if you have a larger chest you may need your regular size.",5
This top is delicate and so feminine. it is beautiful. does run small. i had to size up. i'm usually a 6-8 m and had to buy l. it has no stretch.  so i needed room for movement.,5
This is beautiful. it can serve as a sweater or a coat and i can't wait to start wearing it.,5
"The dress is exactly as pictured. i bought it for work and it is perfect. the lining is the entire length of the dress and it hits just at the knee.  i would say it is true to size, however it was a bit tight in my shoulders but i have very broad shoulders.  i received compliments all day and remarked to myself it was so comfortable it was like wearing pajamas!",5
"Second to shopping for a swimsuit, i hate shopping for jeans. so difficult to find a pair that are both comfortable and stylish. the good news is that this pair is both. the length hits slightly below my ankle which is the perfect length for me (i'm 5'5). they are a slim fit with a slight bit of stretch. i ordered the size 27 which is my normal size and they fit perfectly. love the wash for a casual look. wish they also came in a darker wash for a dressier look. all in all, i am quite pleased. w",5
"I bought this dress for my bridal shower. it's beautiful, tts. i usually wear 2/4 in retailer and the small was perfect. i tried on in store and the dress had a few snags and defects. they ordered me one to be delivered to my apt and it was perfect. the back is pretty too!",5
Great fit and very flattering if you have curves. perfect to throw over just about anything. i've only owned it for 9 days and have worn it four times.,5
"I'm so glad i splurged on this sweater coat! wow! this is the kind of product i come to retailer from! very unique, good quality, flattering, and surprisingly soft! i wore this over a sleeveless dress for a few hours and not only was i very warm, my arms weren't itchy or irritated at all... on the contrary, it was quite comfortable and soft. this is a bit pricey, but i will definitely get good use of it. i found it to run true to size. i typically wear a 6 and ordered a small. my only quibb",5
I love the dress!  i purchased this dress to wear on my honeymoon to paris.  it made me feel like a princess walking around the gardens of versalles while wearing it!,5
The fit of these jeans are so great! they look syllish and feel great at the same time. this brand does a fabulous job of creating a jean that feels like you can wear them dressed up and casual. a+,5
"I absolutely love this tunic and was pleasantly surprised when it arrived in the mail. i thought it looked really cute in the photo here, but it's even better in person and is extremely flattering on. so happy.",5
"This dress i received is stylish, comfortable and very nice to wear. i love the length, goes just below the knee and i am 5'2 so it is perfect for me. i can't say enough about this dress as i can't wear a lot of things because i am apple shaped but with this dress no one would ever know. thank you retailer for this beauty!",5
This top looks elegant with my stirrup pants and feels like heaven it is so soft. fitted at the neck and arms; loose and swingy at the trunk with a beautifully finished hem. the yarn is two-toned heather.,5
I love the length of the dress and the fun swing the skirt has. the print is wonderful.,5
It was purchased as a gift but truly amazing! the quality is fantastic and the owner of the sweater is truly happy with it!,5
"This top! i was hesitant to try this on because it felt too busy, however it is a must have. it's just the right amount of lace and detail. i am typically an m in retailer tops (sometimes l depending on the designer; i'm a 32/34ddd). i initially tried a l in this thinking it had no stretch but ended up going with the medium. the arms were a tad tight but stretched slightly after an hour of wear and it fits perfectly everywhere. i think if you size up it will be too ""blousy."" highly recommend this-",5
"Saturday/sunday never disappoints! love this black cardigan. runs a tad large i noticed in the arm length for me. not a problem anywhere else though. good medium weight to the fabric. durable quality and waist flattering once tied. great for throwing on over a dress, wearing with a t-shirt",5
"This dress is as cute as i hoped it would be. i love the pockets and length and flattering cut. it looks great with boots and is perfect for fall. only con is that it is dry clean only. it seems like the fabric would do just fine with hand washing, and i will probably go for it. i just don't have the patience or organization for dry cleaning.",5
This is a great cold weather alternative to a coat especially in warmer climates. it is lightweight but dense. love the color.,5
This sweater is absolutely beautiful. the shape is very flattering both tied in front and in back. the wool is nice and soft and the color is a nice neutral that will pair well with anything. the stitching is a nice added detail that makes this sweater somethig special. it is a great addition to any wardrobe and i'm thrilled that it is part of mine. i can't wait to wear it!,5
This is perfect! it fits tts. i am usually an 8 and this was spot on. it isn't too short either. it really is as it appears on the model. i absolutely love it and can't wait to wear it. my hubby definitely approved!,5
"I fell in love the first time i saw it. the xs is the perfect fit. i generally wear xs/s or 2 in dresses. its not too snug to wear over a thin to medium thickness sweater. its a good length also, not too long, which i struggle with given my height of 5'3. the s was overall too big. its not itchy, though i've only worn it with long sleeve tops. its just the right weight. not too thin and not too heavy. its feminine and fun. wonderful topper for jeans, pants, or a dress. the color is versatile. sl",5
"This piece is gorgeous in person. it is more of a broen than taupe and goes with everything... it is more of a coat than a sweater. i bought one for my mom, and picked one up for myself when it went on sale. it is moms favorite piece among her extensive retailer collection.",5
"This was my first shot at high-rise bottoms and i love them. the fit is very flattering and the print is adorable. i just bought the bottoms so i can't comment on the top, it looked a bit small for my bust so i am purchasing a solid colored top to match.",5
"This dress is beautiful. even my husband complimented it several times. true to size. due to the button closure in the back, you might have to size up if you are larger in the chest.",5
"This sweater coat caught my attention online, so i went in search for it at my local store. it's a flattering fit, across the chest and shoulders. very well made. the length is mid thigh. i am 5'4"" 125lbs. i went with the small, with the thought of wearing nothing too bulky under it. it does have an attached belt, that can easily be knotted together or each on its own for another look, if you opt to leave it open. it's light weight enough for cool days or evenings, but also warm enough for colde",5
"Comfortable, thick material ( think: structured sweatshirt material) easy to throw on and look as if effort was made - when it wasn't. sizing. i'm between a large and xl usually. large was perfect. i'm tall and curvy: ( 36g curvy) and this cardigan/ belted jacket/is very flattering.",5
"I am so in love with this dress. i think it is made of high quality fabric and very well designed. i am 5'6"", about 145lbs, 34d and the 4 fit perfectly! i bought it for my upcoming bridal shower and could not be more excited to wear it!!",5
"I've been waiting for this dress to come back in stock and when it finally did i got it in the size 2. i'm typically a 2 or 4 in dresses and the 2 fits perfect. for reference i'm 5'6, 34c, 130lb. i think it runs on a larger size because it's a shift dress. i would recommend sizing down. a great white dress to wear to my rehearsal dinner!",5
"This is one of my favorite purchases ever-from anywhere! one of my new years resolutions was to stop wearing work out clothes all of the time. this is as comfortable as any work out jacket and looks classy. can be dressed up or down. its warm, flattering and unique.",5
This dress is a staple. if you don't feel like getting too dressed up and want to be comfortable. this is it. will be great for travel as well. i like to pack light. so i look forward to traveling with this dress.,5
"This dress is really lovely. if fits and flows in a very flattering way although it is a bit long (i'm really tall so that's a very nice feature for me :p) it actually feels more linen-y than i expected to which was surprising, (i probably didn't read the product description close enough) but it was a pleasant surprise. can't wait to wear this to brunch/beach parties this summer! fair warning, it's also a little see-through - might want to wear nude underwear ;)",5
"I really love these jeans! this is my second pair of ags and they're so comfortable. i will say that these jeans are super long! i have long legs and it takes a 3 inch lift from my shoes to get them to hit correctly. if you're short, you can expect to get them hemmed. the high waist is great! size down in ag because they tend to stretch and being high waisted they for differently!",5
"I fell in love with this sweater as soon as i saw it in the store. runs tts. the medium fit perfect. i am 5'10, 160lbs.
very versatile...can wear with jeans or dress up with all black.",5
"This shirt runs large in my opinion. i wish i would have sized down to a xs but maybe it will shrink a little when i wash it. its a great shirt, good quality and i'm very happy i got it.",5
"I love this dress! i was actually able to fit in a l versus my usual xl due to the style of the dress. a bigger chest person (i'm a d) may not find the dress as well fitting as i do. overall great fit can easily dress it warm with a scarf, boots, hat or best. a great dress for fall-spring",5
"Love love love this dress! the fit is amazing and is slimming. although the lace is delicate looking, it wears well.",5
"Got this for my daughter who lives out of town. i plan on bringing it to her during my next visit. i love it! the style is up to date and pretty. it's a perfect dress for almost any occasion! i'm hoping it will fit her, but the sizing looks right to me and the quality is great!",5
"This dress is very flattering and has wonderful movement, i'm so happy that it went on sale! definitely worth it!",5
"Dress is silk? it's soft and pretty. it's blue so you can wear brown or blue suede boots!
i caught my reflection a few times and thought i looked really bottom heavy. dress is awesome. worth it.",5
"Loose fitting and comfortable without losing its shape. 
looks great on. the tie in front adds to the dress. 

i love to wear with tan knee-high boots.",5
Good quality and design. perfect for casual office. definitely recommend. i don't know why it's called a cardigan because it's more like a casual blazer. note there is no button- just the tie to close. runs big. i'm 5'8'' 130# ordered the xs and it's roomy.,5
"I just got this after ordering online and i was pleasantly surprised. the cardigan has the structure of a lightweight jacket, so it creates a flattering silhouette. i ordered it in a medium, and even though i'm curvy on top it fits really nicely.",5
"Love this jacket! the sleeves are a little big/loose but it's not quite as flattering as it could be, but it's so comfy it's worth it! great quality.",5
"I don't know what took me so long to pull the trigger on this item...probably because it wasn't in my store for very long so i didn't try it on in person. i decided to order this based upon the reviews, and i was immediately obsessed. this cardigan is magical. i first wore it to work with black trousers and a plain crewneck t-shirt underneath with a bib necklace, and everybody in my office thought i was wearing the cutest blazer. i had all the ladies come feel it to prove it in fact feels like a",5
"Bought this today and i'm in love!! very flattering, great fit!",5
"Really cute dress and i cannot wait to wear it for my wedding rehearsal dinner. the buttons on the back are my favorite part about the dress since they add something different. it fits tts, but it is more fitted than a regular shift dress, which is nice. i am 5'9, 145 pounds, and the size 6 fit me perfectly.",5
"I bought this in the store and it is beautiful, the red is more of a faded red/burnt orange, not as bright as pictured, which is great. i am usually an xs or s and was a s in this item.",5
"I read the online reviews that the dress ran large so ordered size 6 and 8. i'm normally an 8 or 10, and the 6 fit perfectly. dress hangs beautifully and lining is really soft. appears that it will wrinkle somewhat easily but i am keeping it anyway since it's so beautiful. the bell sleeves are really cute! i highly recommend the dress.",5
"I passed this sweater a few times during a recent visit to retailer. after striking out on several items i thought would work, i grabbed this sweater in the cream color. i loved it as soon as i put it on! it is meant to be oversized, which i love. the neck is chunky and looks good open or buttoned all the way to make a loose turtleneck. looks great with skinny jeans and booties. i went with my usual xs. great purchase!",5
"Totally love this sweater - everything about it i find to match the model pics (fit, color, length). no dry cleaning required on this one, so i plan to get other colors to wear with leggings and skinnies fall through winter. i love that this is oversized without looking frumpy - it does have some shape to it and the knit falls perfects (not a heavy/chunky sweater...think soft mid-weight that you can layer with). worth full price!",5
Beautiful flowing feminine dress. runs large; size down. hot pink color. well made.,5
This sweater is a must have for fall!! super comfy yet stylish fit make it fun to dress up or down. i plan on wearing it with leggings and high boots!,5
"I tried this sweater on in the store, regretted not purchasing it, and ended up buying it online. the fabric is soft, seems to be good quality, and hangs nicely. i purchased the taupe color and it is a rich, pretty color.",5
Bought these a week ago at full price to take on vacation. love them i see they are now 1/2 price if they came in a different color would get a second pair,5
"I love this dress. i am usually a size 4, but ordered this in size 0 and it fits perfect! great for any season, and can dress up or dress down. the pink is the perfect shade - i feel like i'm elle woods!",5
I just received this dress tried it on. i totally fell in love with it . the pink is just beautiful.it's a little big so i will definitely will be exchanging it for a size 14 . you would absolutely love this dress.,5
"I bought this stylish and cozy sweater in ivory. i find that cable knit sweaters tend to add bulk, but this sweater creates a long, lean look. it looks great with leggings and skinny jeans, and the buttons on the cowl are a fun detail. every time i wear this, i get compliments on it.",5
"I love this skirt! fits like a dream, fabric is soft, light, and drapes perfectly. i bought the skewed pullover to wear with it and the colors are perfect. my new favorite summer outfit.",5
This is a beautiful dress! the photos do not do it justice - the pink is gorgeous! it's also very comfortable but runs large. i'm usually a 6 or an 8 but purchased a 4.,5
"Saw this on sale and tried it, not expecting anything and wound up loving it. i am 5'4 and it covers my thighs and rear well so i can wear it with leggings. it came mid thigh on me. the red is a rich burnt orange/red. i love that is is mostly cotton so i won;t get overheated.",5
The dress arrived wrinkled so i washed it and pressed it. it looked beautiful until i sat down. the entire dress was wrinkled and it looked terrible all day. can't wear this again.,1
"I purchased this piece in store in a size small, ivory. i am usually a size medium but the small fit perfect! material is soft, lightweight, and very comfortable. collar can be buttoned to create more of a turtleneck look or unbuttoned to create less of the same look. i'm so glad i grabbed this because it is a great cold weather staple and i doubt they will last long!!",5
"This shirt works for both going out and going to work, and i can wear it with everything. fits perfect, tucked and untucked, tied and untied. i love it.",5
"This cozy sweater looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. as a 55-year-old woman who loves retailer i'm always on the lookout for cute clothes that don't make me look like i'm trying to dress too young. this sweater is comfy and stylish and looks really classy. i wore it to a holiday party and got many compliments, which is unusual for what is basically a simple ivory sweater. it breathes, has just the right amount of room in the sleeves, and was a great purchase. i wish i had bought other colo",5
This was my go to dress this past summer. so easy to wear and pair with cute wedges. perfect to dress up or down.,5
"I absolutely love this dress. i bought this right before traveling to italy for vacation. it was perfect for the hot weather, flows nicely and was comfortable for a whole day walking around. i am usually a small, but this just felt to loose on my chest. i went with an xs.",5
I love this dress! easy breezy flowy comfortable & pink! fits a true medium ...would recommend to anyone. makes me a little flirty!,5
"This sweater is super cozy and comfy and my new favorite sweater! the green is a dark khaki and really pretty. it's long enough to wear with leggings, but not boxy or frumpy.",5
"I bought this dress for a couple fall weddings to hide my postpartum belly. it was only available in a size 8 -- which is my typical size. i was nervous based on the reviews it would still be too big, but it fits perfectly. i am 5'10"", so i assume my frame can handle the drappiness well!",5
"After reading the previous review, i was pretty confident in ordering this dress. it arrived in the mail today, and i was so disappointed. first of all, it's huge. the medium was way too big on me, and i'm never a small at retailer! (i even considered ordering the large in this - my normal size at retailer.) second, the colors are not as vibrant as in the photo, and the fabric felt cheap. finally, it just looked like i went to hawaii and bought a drab dress there that didn't fit right.",1
"Fun dress to wear, i received numerous compliments on the color and design of the dress. very flowy and comfortable, love it. i wish i had bought a size smaller than i normally wea because it runs large, but an overall great dress",5
"Unlike other reviews, i did not have a problem with the seam. this is a cute shirt that can be dressed up or down.",5
"I purchased this blouse in black. love it. this blouse goes with everything from jeans to work to cocktail. it is perfect! my only wish is that it came in a colors. i would add navy, red, green, white. i'm tempted to purchase another one just so i never have to worry about the one i have wearing out. buy it - you won't be sorry.",5
Always attracted to wool for its warmth and breathability. this jacket has great style that can be casual or dressed up some. it's slightly more boxy then expected which i think lends to the casual look. find myself wearing it a lot.,5
"This dress is a great color, fabric, and the style is very flattering! i'm wearing to a wedding but it will be great for many events this fall! dressy enough for a cocktail party but could also wear to church!",5
"This sweater just grows on me every time i put it on. it is so comfortable, flattering and literally the perfect winter sweater. the length is long but so comfortable with leggings or skinny jeans. absolutely love it. i have the cream color one and i have to wear a tank under but the material and look is perfect.",5
"This skirt is stunning. like the other reviewer, i believe this is probably the most beautiful thing in my closet. the colors are just striking. it is also flattering - i find some skirts can kind of pouf out around the hips and add bulk, this one lays nice and flat and looks great. the material is very soft and simple and i love the frayed edges at the bottom. i am just between 5""3"" and 5'4"" and weigh 112 lbs; i took an xs and it fits perfectly, so it seems true to size. only thing, if you are",5
"I cannot imagine this dress working in any size. i am a small, thin and average height woman (usually a 25/26 in pants, a size 32c bust, and 5'6"" tall). this dress was huge. i sized down to a 2 ( i am always a 4 in dresses) and this dress was still big... i do not know if i could size down to a 0 though as the shoulders seemed to fit right. it was ginormous. i got it for a wedding in two months and i will be 3 months pregnant, it still wouldn't work unless i was 9 months pregnant and carrying tr",1
"Saw this in store today and had to have it. the pink is a really bright pink - definitely more of a hot pink than it appears in the image online. i am a solid 10, and i bought this in an 8, so it definitely runs a size large. highly recommend!",5
I love this sweater especially the color. i never would have order this sweater on line but when i saw it in person the color was more of a burnt orange. the fit was perfect. i can wear with skinny jeans or leggings.,5
"I love this dress and received many compliments when i wore it. the pink is beautiful. however, it does run large so i will need to exchange it. the little square at the base of the neckline was crooked on the one i received. might not bug anyone else, but it bothered me.",5
"I hesitated purchasing this because of the high price, so kept waiting and then the petite sizes ran out so i figured i missed it. then miraculously the petite in the green was available so i went for it. this sweater is yummy and cozy. drapes beautifully. i am 5'1"" , short waisted, and wear size 2 in most clothes. the petite s fits perfectly. with a pair of black leggings and high boots, this is a winner outfit for fall and winter. very comfy. the sweater has a bit of an open-weave, so keep tha",5
I saw this skirt online and immediately went to the store to hunt it down.  is perfect!  one of the most beautiful items of clothing i own.  was worried the waistband would be unflattering since i'm short and curvy but it's very flattering.  can dress up or wear to the beach.  i love it!!,5
"I purchased this in the ivory color and love it. very comfortable and agree with reviewer who said it looks good with 1 button or 2 buttoned up. my one complaint is that i found it to be such an open weave that i feel it necessary to wear a cami underneath, which is not the end of the world. the other issue i have: the back is definitely longer than the front, as pictured. i'm not sure why retailer feels compelled to have almost every top they sell have this styling, i don't think its necessary an",5
"I saw this sweater online and i fell in love with it! i was hoping to wear it for christmas. it arrived on time and it was such an amazing color. there is a touch of orange to the red color. it has a buttoned collar, and i like wearing it with one button open. it has to be one of the softest, most comfy sweaters i've ever worn. i wore it with skinny jeans and boots. it would be fine with leggings, too. the style and quality is superb, as always. i'm very pleased with this purchase!",5
This shirt feels amazing. it also drapes nicely and is very feminine and flattering. great versatile piece.,5
"This sweater was exactly what i was looking for...something well made, cozy, easy to just throw on and go and still look chic. i am 5'3"" and 110 lbs and the x-small fit perfectly - still roomy but drapes well. i got the taupe which is nice but i got the red color for my sister in law and its gorgeous- more of a burnt orange than the red show here. i would definitely recommend this sweater!",5
"I bought two of these in red and taupe. this is a great sweater for those of us who can't wear wool but need to stay warm. the cowl is adjustable with buttons, so not overwhelming even on a small person such as myself (5'2""). the texture is yummy and so are the colors. softness factor is over the top, too. i wish it came in black. have not washed them yet, so can't attest to that feature, but i am very happy with the quality, so far. thanks retailer!!!",5
The top looks exactly as pictured and i liked the fabric. the fit is classic and i will be able to wear this top many different ways. i was hoping that it was long sleeve but it is actually 3/4 sleeve.,5
"I love this sweater! it's extremely cozy and great for wearing with leggings due to the length. i ordered the red color in a s and it fits great and it is long, like i had hoped. the red is really more of a burnt orange than the red in the photo, but i actually like that even better.",5
"Beautiful dress, just like wearing a night shirt!!  great flattering fit for most figures!! wonderful color love the bell sleeves.",5
I hesitated to purchase this dress because of the color but it is a beautiful deep pink that i think would work with all skin tones. i ordered a size down as recommended by other reviewers and the dress fits perfectly. the feel is amazing - incredibly comfortable and not too short when you lean over!,5
"This dress does run large, but i sized down from med to small and it's a great fit. the fabric is lightweight as silk sometimes is, and is nicely flowy, but might require a slip.",5
"As the other reviewer said, the skirt had this weird bunching on both sides of the hips-it was ridiculous. i don't know how anyone could wear it-looks like you had two little triangle things poking out from each hip. i'm long and lean so usually skirts like this fit me well. very very strangely constructed-i couldn't keep it even at the deeply discounted price",1
"Love this blouse. per the previous review, there was no problem with my tailoring. it is exactly as shown. i plan to handwash this and take super good care of it. you can tell from the picture it could be an excellent wardrobe staple and absolutely timeless as well as the kind of sexy and elegant you can get away with in the office.

i do think it runs a tiny bit small. however, it is not short. it's just quite a fitted piece. i would consider sizing up. i love the look of the medium on me, 5'10",5
"Love this! ordered it on sale, but i really do think it's worth full price! i went with a small even though an extra small would have been good too...i'm slender and 5'9"" about 125# with full bust. the small fits similar to the model, and because i wanted it to fit well in the sleeves (i have long arms!) and length, i went with the small. maybe should have gone smaller as it is roomy! it's very well made and although you'll need a cami, i still feel as if it will be very cozy. perfect for our mi",5
"This is my new favorite sweater and i want it in all sizes. i have the ivory and now the taupe-totally would have bought the green had it been in stock. the red is a more rust color, but it is still gorgeous. although the knit looks and is looser, it is still very warm. i wore it today and was a little too hot for this mild day. it is longer so it can be worn nicely with leggings and still look great, but it has a good fit and shape so as not to look frumpy. love. tts, but could also size down i",5
Love this pullover for its versatile style (can be buttoned or unbuttoned) and easy care look. it's casual without looking sloppy. the weave is a bit open work and can easily complement a cami or a thicker top without making me look like a stuffed sausage. the hi-lo hem on the model shots do not look that way irl. the hem is straighter. soft nubbly texture that may snag easily. got this in red and brown but wanted the sold out green too.,5
This dress is adorable. dress it up or dress it down,5
"Like many of the other reviewers, i thought this ran a little big. i am a 5'5"", 110lb pear and xs was perfect - i also ordered the small to be sure. it is not quite as close to the body as the picture. the color is gorgeous and saturated. it hits me mid thigh in a good way. the fabric is crepe on the outside and silky on the inside and it has a beautiful, high quality drapey-ness. it is unlined but not see through. it arrived wrinkled and sad, but a warm dry iron really brought out how gorgeous",5
I am so excited about this swimsuit. i have never felt so good in a bathing suit. it's sexy without being too revealing. the fit is perfect. i absolutely love it!,5
"I usually do not buy dresses at full price but when i saw the teal version of this dress on the website i caved in and bought it. i had also tried the pink version of this dress in store. it's very cute and sweet but i don't think i can pull it off. the teal version is pretty accurate in color to the on screen image.

this dress runs huge. i usually wear a 6 or 8 in retailer dresses and went with a size 2 for this one. it fits comfortably without being too baggy or like a tent. the materi",5
This is the perfect fall/winter sweater. i bought it in red and i would get another one in the green color if it weren't sold out in my size. love it!,5
This was exactly as expected. i ordered my usual size medium. fit well. good quality fabric. it's one of my comfy weekend go to items.,5
"This sweater is gorgeous, i wish i could have purchased in several colors because it's now a staple in my closet. downside- it does say delicate cold water wash, but the lace on the back is so delicate and pulling happens on the sides every time i wear it, so dry cleaning is the way to go. the sweater does snag easily, so don't wear anything that could get caught in it (jewelry/handbags with chains or embellishments) because they will catch.",5
I love love love this top and have received many compliments. if anything it runs small (i wear size 6 and a 36d bra and the s was roomy),5
These are such beautiful cheerful shorts. the floral motif just makes me smile. they do have brocade on them which is nice and dressy. they are perfect for a night out or a day at the beach. i went tts on them. i purchased similar shorts last year in the brown color. very nice shorts to have in your wardrobe..,5
"I typically wear boring shorts. you know - khaki. i saw these in the store and had to try them on. true to size in the waist, not too short, and the leg fit was perfect (slim without being skin tight). the pattern is far from boring. i can't wait to wear them out.",5
"So this is a pricey tee but i ordered it on sale?still pricey. i?m really surprised how much i ended up loving it and wearing it. ordered it in the light red, size xs and it has become my go to tank for the summer?i wear it every week. the armholes are a tab long on me so i wear a black sports bra underneath and it does peak through but not in a tacky way. if you don?t mind the price i would pick this up.",5
This top is fabulous! the color is amazing and the back is just beautiful! i would recommend this sweater to anyone i absolutely love it! my only concern is getting it snagged on something other than that it's a score!,5
"I wore this out to a dinner-party that was thrown for me, and people loved the surprise back. i have a few lace back shirts, but this one is gorgeous and sexy. i am incredibly cautious about the lace, however. it is so delicate. no issues, but just be careful!",5
"This is such a great top for spring and summer. i've worn it with shorts, capris, and jeans, as well as layered it under a denim jacket. it brings an element of whimsy to any outfit. it's comfortable and really well made.",5
I love the detailed cutouts on the shirt and the liner is finished with a scalloped edging. perfectly cool for the summer time but also stylish and hip.,5
"This is a simple shirt, but so cool and comfortable in the hot florida summer! i'm ordering one in the blue and white as well... i know this is going to be a fave. i love supima cotton, and though i adore retailer, i do wish they'd carry more of the supima rather than the non-organic fabrics. so many of the pretty things i simply will not buy, because i prefer the feel of silk, linen and cotton. thanks for this one, retailer!",5
"Love shorts that i can dress down w/ a chambray top or that i dress up w/ heeled sandals and a blouse. this is perfect!
i found them to run a tad big.
i have thin legs but don't have a small waist at all. i took a 0 in them, i'm usually more like a 2 on bottom.",5
"I love the colors, my favorite. purchased a medium and fits perfectly. i've been wearing it all summer. material is thin but super soft. for reference i am 5'8"" 145 lbs 32dd. i'm obsessed with this tank. considering buying a second just in case anything happens to the one i have, that's how much i love this tank.",5
"This is one of those ""very retailer"" tops that you can't find anywhere else. the feel is ""folkloric"", but the country is not specific. although listed as a ""tee"", the material is a knit with heft and is lined (from the bust seam down). the embroidery is combined with cut-work to give it a high-end finish (and justify the price). this is a dress-up tee for sure. i will most likely treat it as a blouse and wear it with cropped black culottes or a slim midi skirt. i wear either a 0 or 2 in mos",5
"I ordered this in a size 1 which i thought would be a small and it was very, very wide. it is very short too. i typically wear a small and am 5'8"" and 132 lbs. it's going back unfortunately. very soft material though.",1
"The fit in the skirt is flexible because the waist is elastic and the shape is flattering, it doesn't stick out too far over the butt. the brocade texture and gold and blue colors are very fall. looking forward to wearing this with boots and tights. i'm usually either a large or medium in skirts and i went for a medium in this one.",5
"In love with this. as soon as i received it in the mail i ordered another color. super soft and easy to wear. i imagine i will live in this top the rest of the summer. felt pricey, but worth it for as much wear as i will get out of it. i am 5'10, 160 and the large is a great fit. perfect fit on the shoulders and just a hair loose throughout the rest of the tank, which is what i wanted.",5
"This top is gorgeous. the colors are lovely, design and quality are impeccable, and it is versatile. this top just happened to catchc my eye and i am so happy with my purchase. it fits tts. i love it!!",5
"Bought on a whim as a gift for my mom, fit perfectly and she loved the details. did not complain of itching as with prior review. it is more blue than gray appearing the photo.",5
"I absolutely love this sweater. it's super soft and the grey/white version is lovely. it's definitely more cropped (i'm 5'7), but looks great with high waisted jeans or a pencil skirt. 

so cozy!",5
"I usually take a small in retailer tops. i did have to order this in a medium though because it is slightly more form fitting. the material seems a little thin so i hope it holds up well over time. i love the green color though. i am curvy especially on the bottom and this was very flattering on me. i do think it is too expensive for what it is especially with the material being thin (even at sales price). overall though, i thought it flattering enough to keep.",5
"First off, they are much prettier irl than in the photos online. they fit very large on me. i am usually a 8 or 10 but have hips so ordered the10. wrong decision. i needed the 8.",5
"These shorts are extremely cute! i usually have a hard time finding shorts i like, but when i saw these the floral and brocade was too nice not to try. the length is good and they are not tight on the thighs, but not too loose either. the material makes them friendly for work as well as outings and running about town. i got my usual size 8 and found that to work perfectly!",5
"Color (orange/red) and fabric nice and good quality
i ordered this since i live in astoria but am glad i did.",5
"Fun to wear inside sneakers or just around the house shoeless. my daughters tried to take them, but i held on to them.",5
"After reading many positive reviews i ordered. sure glad i did. i love the light, airy fabric. it hangs nicely. i am mostly a 12, sometimes a 14. i ordered both sizes and the 14 was a perfect fit. i am very pleased with this purchase. thought it might be too girly and/or young looking on me, but not so at all. i got the white and i certainly like the red detail at the button holes too.",5
"Mine was slightly tight across the bust area, but i'm able to leave it open with a light tank underneath. it still looks great!",5
"Tried this on a whim in store, and it might not look like much on the hanger, but this beauty fits perfectly and is quite flattering! it is loose without being billowy (still has nice tailoring for shape), the fabric is light but good quality, and the pattern is super cute. i was shocked when i saw that the price was much lower than expected - this is a true win, even at full price. for reference, i'm 5'7"" 128lbs and took my usual size s.",5
"So different loose linen, i love the raw edge and the color i can wear with anything over a dress...great top with raw edges",5
"Love the color, ordered the plum. it is very nice in person, not quite as burgundy, more purple-y... i don't typically go for the plain dresses, as i feel at the price, it should be a statement, but i don
't have a dress like this:

wearable as casual or dressed up
solid plain color
soft fabric
long sleeves, yet sexy enough without being too much
flirty (it is on the shorter side)

i decided to keep it as dolan makes a similar dress every year, and i pass every year... this is the year",5
"This is an ideal top - especially for summer. so lightweight and soft! the detailing is adorable and makes this simple shirt feel very special, yet everyday! i ordered the black, and am back for the other colors! this one is an absolute win.",5
"I came across this in the store and immediately fell in love with it. the online photos just don't do it justice! i bought the white version because the little pops of red in the details and the dobby weave are so sweet and unique. 

a size 0 fit perfectly. the fabric is a bit sheer, so be prepared to wear a cami underneath. very light, airy, and comfortable!",5
I ordered the orange plaid version in size 16. it fit me like it does the model. it's true to size. the peplum is very comfortable. the plaid isn't see-through so no extra layer of a tank is needed. the neckline isn't too low. very well-made and a great choice for summer!,5
"I tried on this dress in the portland, me, store today. so much good to say about it: the wine color is deep and rich, the fabric hand is similar to a heavy weight silk, the cut of the dress so flattering.
but, i didn't get it. i am 5'2"" and weigh 135 lbs. i can sometimes wear a medium, but my upper arms and hips can require a large, usually petite for proper length. the store didn't have a large (i didn't even realize the dress also came in petite), so i tried on a medium. nice fit through the",5
It is a little roomy so if you're between sizes go with the smaller. i think it's flattering even if you have a larger chest. love the details and the fabric is a good weight and quality!,5
"There wasn't much question as to whether or not i'd love these pants, as i have several pairs of the pilcro ""hyphen"" pant; however, this one is slightly different (front pocket's and seam down front),
and though they are slightly different, the fit and cut are the same.
these pants are a great weight--can wear year round, really--but these will be my ""go to"" pants this fall and winter.
the length is nice--can wear with shoes or rolled up with boots, too--""utility"" chinos? yes!

the fit is nicely",5
"I have a few pairs of pilcro pants and they have yet to disappoint. the fit, the style and the quality is just perfect for me. i know i can go to my size and expect a perfect fit every time.",5
Love this skirt - it looks precisely as the photo depicts. the metallic stitching may be a little bothersome for some in terms of itching/scratching. i&#39;m 5&#39;8&quot; 135# and the 6 fit perfectly (pear/hourglass).,5
This top is so soft i want to wear it every day. the orange is beautiful in person. great fall color. perfect amount of swing.,5
"I wear between a l and xl..i chose the xl which was the right choice..if you are a bit curvy in proportions, i could size up. the color is gorgeous...i just logged back on to order another if there were options, but alas, there are not. flattering arm cut! could be worn for work, or with jeans/ out to dinner. it's cute, you won't regret it! (as a side note, it is sheer...which you can see in the photo. needs a cami)",5
"The material on this dress is so soft and wonderfully drapey. super flattering; defines waist enough to not add bulk but also hide a tummy. the purple color is lovely, perfect for fall. for reference, i'm 5'1, 32dd, 118 lbs with hourglass figure.",5
"This tee shirt is just adorable. i found it at a local retailer and decided to try it on - and just loved it! i happened to walk out of my dressing room while wearing it, to talk to my daughter who was shopping with me and three customers in the hall said"" that is so cute!"" and went to find their own. i bought the ivory color, but the other colors are really nice as well.

the fabric is substantial, soft and thick. the little ruffle at the shoulder makes a cute statement, but is just fun and not",5
First saw the jacket online and liked it so i went to the store to check out. the color looks nicer in person.  it fitted me really well and looked really nice on me. the jacket is very soft and well made.  the only thing is the sleeves are a little longer but not a big deal. can't wait to wear it when the full is here!,5
"I waited so long before trying this on because i have a bad addiction to white/cream tops that i'm trying to get over and branch out, but after seeing someone else wearing it i decided to give it a whirl. i was also trying on the black and white charlie's with the leaf print at the time and fell in love. it hits me a lot longer than the modeled photo (i'm about 5'7"" for reference) and the shoulders were a little tight for me in my usual small, so i got a medium. the sleeve length is perfection,",5
"I noticed this top as i was going into the fitting room, and tried it on on impulse. i was pleasantly surprised with the fit and soft quality of the fabric, and even more impressed with the price. i usually like my tops very fitted, and found this one hung loose, but not boxy. i have been wearing it quite a bit, sometimes with a camisole underneath, and sometimes not. i bought the one with the flowers, and it is not see-through, and the light fabric is good for our warm heat. i bought my usual s",5
I bought this b/c it looked exactly my style and i was right! i've worn this once and it is so comfortable and the fit is great. i can see this being a shirt i wear again and again all summer. i bought the black and am thinking about buying the peachy-plaid color...,5
I sew and therefore i can tell when something is cut and designed well. this top hangs beautifully and the colors are very pretty. it's cotton.,5
"This dress is a new favorite! the cut is great for most figures and the fabric has a nice drape around the curves of the body so it sort of has a slimming effect - which i love! i'm petite and curvy and so the hem lands closer to top of my knees than it does on the model in the image. the color in person is slightly more purple and less brown/maroon, but it still works for a fall/winter wardrobe. if you are uneasy about the colors, i recommend looking at it in store before purchasing. i love thi",5
"I got this in black. it can be casual or dressy. very lightweight, comfortable and flattering. i ""collect"" black tops (since i rarely wear any other color) and this is now one of my favorites. i think it looks totally different in the black than it does in the other colors -- more refined, less casual. this runs quite large. i am a 0-2 but needed the 00 in this top.",5
"Such a cute shirt! i picked up the white-with-flowers that is not being shown online yet. the straight white looks like it could wrinkle and definitely needs a tank underneath but the white with flowers was not see-through and seems like it will require a bit less steaming (the detail masks wrinkles :)) the flowered-design also has a small tie at the neck that i don't think was on the solid color design (can't totally remember) - cute extra detail but not overly obvious, it blends into the shirt",5
I am in love with this top! it is so comfortable and lovely. it runs a touch big like most items of this brand.,5
"Smooth to the touch and body skimming, this dress drapes over my figure flaws without drawing attention. it's a great base layer for many accessories and outfits. i love this fabric dolan uses, i already own the sleeveless and cap sleeve versions of this dress. i would love if retailer would sell me a long sleeved maxi or midi version. i'm 135# 38/27/35 and purchased size m regular in green.",5
"I bought this in the store without trying it in the black. when i put it on, i loved it. so much so that i went back and purchased the black patterned one. equally as nice.",5
"I am not usually a khaki type of pant person but these are really cute and have interesting details such as the buttons at the ankles. they are also quite flattering and do not ""bag"" out after a day of wearing. i am 5'6"" and about 130lbs. the size 2s fit great. i purchased the ""green"" color and it goes well with a number of tops. these can be dressed up with heels and great to run around on the weekend. the material is soft which is always a plus for me. overall a great purchase.",5
"This is a beautiful and classic blouse. great fit and flow. however, the silk is very light and the snap falls off easily; tricky to sew back on since the fabric is so delicate.",5
"My first pair of pilcros and i am in love. i am 5'5"" 125lbs and bout size 25 in the moss green. i have a skinny/athletic build, and even though i have a small frame, i have thick legs (soccer player) and big butt and hips but a skinny waist. it is hard to find pants that go up my leg, over my butt and don't have a huge gap in the back where i have to wear a belt.... these pants checked all boxes and the best part was the fit around my waist, it is like a glove, no belt required. they have a litt",5
"Adorable fit. the lightweight madras fabric will be perfect for a hot summer day but not see-through. the slightly gathered bottom makes gives my petite frame a taller look. easy to wear, not fussy, no special bra needed.",5
"I paid full price for these gladly (the olive ones) and was delighted when i was able to purchase the black on sale. they are midweight, soft, flattering and stylish. they stretch a little (belt needed) but not much. pilcro are my go-to pants and these hit it out of the park. i wish they would come in a lighter weight version for warmer weather !",5
"I love this shirt. it is soft, romantic and flowy.  i love the material it is probably one of the softest things i own. great quality and lightweight.",5
I bought this on sale in black. it doesn't look like much online but it is very flattering and super thin and airy which is great for warm weather. tts- i'm an 8/10 38c and the 10 fits just right.,5
"I am so love in this top, i wish i had it in all colors and will absolutely be watching the sale rack for these ones. i love this top. i work out at a gym that requires tops, but that means i cannot usually display my awesome sports bras with cute strappy backs. this yoga top has an open back which will show these off, which i really like. the draped back keeps you nice and cool also. and the fit is amazing. i have some extra baby belly that i can't seem to work off-it was invisible in this top.",5
"I am absolutely in love with this piece! yes it runs large. i'm usually a medium to large in vests ands the small fits me prefectly! the quality is superb. i love the feel of the faux fur, i want to pet it! and the snaps and hooks seem as if they will also last forever. thank you tracy!",5
"I bought this tee becasue of the color and brand (my favorite tees last summer were by bordeaux) and am so pleased. the color is great for a fall layering piece, and the fabric is so soft....amazing! it may be better for layering, the fabric is very thin.",5
"I got this top in white and really like it. its soft, comfortable fits well but it is a little see through.",5
"These fit quite well, and it's rare that i find shorts that fit well without being too tight. great for spring or summer. fits tts.",5
This blouse is flattering and fits great. i also have the other color in cream with the floral design. very nice!,5

"I'm 5'5"", 125 lbs, 34c and the xs fit perfectly. very soft, feminine top. i got many compliments the first day i wore it. wire it for business casual, but looking forward to wearing it with flare jeans for a more 70's look. highly recommend this great sale on a wonderful top.",5
I love how you can wear this with a t-shirt or blouse.,5
These are a soft and lightweight material. the photos here don't show the tiny beautiful pattern on them. look closely through the photos and you'll see it. way better than a normal pair of black summer pants. these are very log so i plan to hem to flats to wear for a more casual look but they have the ability to go either way. the pockets flare out a big so i'm going to have those sewn shut when i do the hemming. it is a higher west so great for that look or to wear with some cropped style summ,5
"Interestingly, the description said this was blue, but as it looks on the picture, it is more grey. that being said, about the zippie: love. my stylist (i brought it in for a try on session at my local store), said, ""you know how i feel about sweats, i won't like it""... joke on her, she turned around and was ok, i shouldn't have looked, love the ruffles at the bottom...it makes this ""sweater"" much more special. it is actually really cute for casual day, jeans t-shirt, kids... or over sweats. any",5
"This is my favorite shirt to wear around the house. it's so soft and the waffle texture looks nice, i'd definitely wear it for a run to the store or an evening walk around the neighborhood. the fabric is thin but isn't too delicate and it's not sheer, which makes it a great summer lounge shirt. the cut is flattering and the back doesn't show my bra, which too many of this design do. it is a bit large, you may want to size down if you want it to be a bit more body conscious.",5
"Love these shorts. i purchased them in the peach color. the color is perfect, the fit is perfect, they look great. highly recommend!",5
These short are the best! the denim is incredibly soft. they go perfect with both casual and nice tops. i would wear them out everyday if i could.,5
"Unfortunately this was too low cut for me,so i had to return it. i wish the neckline was higher. i could tug it up but it slipped right back down. the fabric is a perfect spring weight and the floral pattern is lovely. on me the ties, no matter how i fiddled, didn't cover the cleavage issue and i am a aa!",5

I absolutely love this shirt. it's a simple tee but the open back adds cute detail to it. i ordered a small and it fit perfectly. color is beautiful also.,5

it is gorgeous, casual, unique and a closet must have!
i wore it for the first time to an nhl game with black jeans and a red tee and got tons of compliments.

This will be a cardigan i will wear across all seasons. if you want to layer a button down or another long sleeve shirt under it i would suggest sizing up one size. as soon as i put this on it felt like it molded to me. it's beautiful! and comfortable.,5

I just love the print on this shirt!  it is so feminine and pretty!  the material is very soft!  i took my usual medium.  a great addition to my spring wardrobe!,5
This skirt is a great fit for curvy women. i highly recommend it.,5
Fun blouse for spring with enough details to make it unique and dressy. very comfortable fit. banded bottom which is loose enough to still be comfortable. dresses up a pair of jeans quite nicely!,5
"I really love the colors of this top, especially in the pinky pastels. it fits really well, can be tied or untied, and will pair with just about anything from skinny jeans to pilcro shorts. speaking of that, i do recommend pairing it with skinny pants or crops because it does have that classic retailer ""am i hiding a pregnancy"" feel to it. 

but...the price tag. $98 for a tank blouse is just too much for me. i will save this one in my shopping bag and hope it's still available once it goes on sa",5

"Nice work top! i ordered the slightly yellow ivory print, which is beautiful, and the print placement perfect. even better, it's work appropriate. the cotton/synthetic blend has stretch without stretching out.

size: i ordered my normal size small for retailer brands like meadow rue. i'm 5'4"", approx 140 lbs, 35-30-37, 34d, narrow shoulders, short arms, long torso.

fit: the sleeves are slightly long, but the buttoned cuffs rest at my wrist. the fabric blend allows this top very good drape. i like",5
"These pants are gorgeous when you first see them. they fit beautifully when you first put them on. and then you wear them for one day. and they snag. on everything. and little strings start to come out of the pants. and the hem begins to unravel. and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy, worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day.

T.la has another winner in my book. i decided on the blue and thrilled with the tee. it's a soft blue almost light periwinkle. fabric isn't so thin so it not see through. thank goodness. i actually love it so much i'm ordering the other color as well. i absolutely would recommend this cute tee. love love t.la.,5
This shirt is true to size. it has beautiful detail and feels very soft and comfortable. it can be worn to dress up jeans or with a skirt for a night out for dinner.,5
"I'm an xl in retailer blouses, and this blouse is the same. i'm guessing women with a thin frame might size down, but i can't say for sure. i purchased the white blouse with the floral pattern. there is a narrow band on the bottom, but it isn't tight, so i didn't find it to be a problem. i usually don't like blouses with banded bottoms, but this is loose. the band does cause the blouse to blouse out a bit, but the fabric has a really nice drape to it, so it worked fine. the fabric has a gre",5
This is the perfect summer top. super lightweight but with a little swing in it so it is not tight across the hips. the bright colors go with almost anything and the detailing at the top makes this dressier than a regular shirt. great with skirts and jeans!,5

"I love this vest. i think it is heavy for a warm spring/summer day so kind've surprised it was featured at the store early spring. i waited for it to go on sale and purchased my normal retailer size medium. i agree it may seem big or loose fitting but i am a vest girl and the fit for me is perfect. size 34 dd, 145 lbs and 5 ft 4 in height. it is a great finishing piece for causal or office attire. this vest will definitely stay in my closet for a long time. beautiful quality.",5
"These pants are so great;style,beautiful soft fabric and love the length (i am 5'10""). i found the rise to be low and like the fact that that they sit at the hips. i had to size up from my usual size in this brand. very flattering and comfortable.",5
"This top is really a great, and it's very affordable. the fabric is light weight, but opaque enough that you don't need a cami. even though this has long sleeves, i can imagine wearing this well into the summer (and i live in south florida). it's comfortable, and the band at the bottom is not tight. the color is slightly ivory and the floral print is clear and bright. the neck tie is really nice and adds a '70's vibe without being overdone or overly dramatic. definite keeper.",5
"You can't tell by the photo but the top is actually a slightly shiny material...so it gives it a classy, going out look. in the picture it looks more casual, but i can see myself wearing this on a night out with a skirt, wearing it to work, or whatever. i tried it on and i thought ""wow, i look thin."" it's a little shorter than i normally wear (don't worry, it's not a crop top, but notice where the bottom hem sits on the models hips, probably mid-rise), but it looked amazing on. zippers in the ba",5
The larkspur tank is colorful and the embroidered bib is beautiful. the material is soft but not diaphanous. it can hide my little pouch without looking like maternity clothing. love it!,5
"I'm very surprised by the review given that said this was frumpy. it it absolutely adorable, and the classic plaid is timeless. as first reviewer said, the styling of this on the model does it no favors. it is in reality form fitting but in a very flattering, forgiving way. the waist nips in nicely underneath the top section, then flares out on the bottom section. that bottom flare can sometimes add inches/pounds but this top does it in a very modern, subtle and flattering fashion. and the mater",5
Definitely a good buy especially when i bought it on sale! it's warm and can be worn dressed up or down.,5
I love the flowers on this top. the style is cute with the band at the waist. i ordered an extra small and it fits perfectly.,5
"Love this tank. it is so soft and comfortable. the length hits just right on the hip. it hugs the body nicely, not too tight, just loose enough on a hot summer day. i have this in black and white. i wish they would offer more colors.",5
"I am 5'7, the length is perfect, i can wear it with flat. normally the wide leg pants are so long, i have to wear high heels. the flow is perfect too.",5
"I sat on the fence almost too long on this piece and finally ordered one when it popped up as a return...so happy imwas able to snag it. it is incredible. i put it with my favorite closed jeans and chanel work boots and wow! i also have tried belting it where the fur begins and that looks equally fabulous. imput true to size as it is suppose to be roomy, to many people ruin styles by trying to get them to fit in a way they were not meant to...embrace the uniqueness of this piece and roder true t",5
"Love this vest!. it does run large so definitely size down. i'm 5'0, 110 lbs and i ordered the xs which is roomy around the mid section but i think that's the style as the shoulders hit where they should. it is such a fun and unique piece. i cannot wait to wear it with tights or black leggings with boots.",5
I got this at the sale price and it fits great. the bottom was wrinkled so it was not as open at the end like the picture but i am sure an iron will help.,5
"I tried on these pants and was instantly in love. they are very flattering and stylish, but also incredibly comfortable. i am 5' 6"", and the length is perfect to wear with 3"" heels. i highly recommend these!",5
"Got this in the black when i was in greenville nc. i had seen it online for a little while and didn't think much of it until i tried it on in the store. it's surprisingly comfortable and it isn't too heavy. its the perfect ""staple"" black shirt in my closet. it is also very forgiving.",5
Huge with bountiful amounts of extra fullness....not like represented picture. and it snags very easily. i have a 4 mo. old puppy that jumped up on me as i was trying it on and snagged it in several places. 'i'm going to see about returning it with the snags.,1
"Love this blouse. i usually wear a small and had to exchange it for an xs, which fits perfectly. not form fitting but flattering; washes beautifully, too. i highly recommend this blouse.",5
"Overall beautiful skirt, material is a little on the heavy and stiff side but still a really nice skirt",5
"Love, love this top. it is soft, comfortable, and cute. it is versatile (e.g. i can dress up for work or dress down by throwing on a pair of jeans). the tie at the neck adds a cute detail (if you want it tied). great staple for the wardrobe. i purchased in the black and it is very versatile, not sure how i feel about the print...",5
"This is one of my all time favorite retailer purchases. this dress is perfect in every way - mine fits me exactly like the model and i was lucky enough to purchase it in black. if you're on the fence, take the plunge and buy this dress - you won't be disappointed!",5
"I was looking for a dress for my engagement pictures and once i saw this dress i knew it was the one! i ordered the white in a small (size 2) i am 5'4 130lbs. it fits perfect and the length is just right. some reviews said it's boxy and has too much flow to it but if you have the right size it won't be an issue! yes, it's a lace dress so it's going to be delicate and you'll need to handle with care. but it's worth it, absolutely stunning!",5
"I was so excited to see these pants on sale. they fit beautifully and drape well. the hidden lining of 'shorts' is a great feature and i will get 3 seasons of use from these.
now if i could only get them in plain black too ....",5
I love this dress. you can wear it for everyday or you can put some bling with it and dress it up. it fits very well. flattering. i highly recommend!!,5
This is a cute stylish sweater different from the typical. it doesn't itch which is key at least for me. i ordered an extra small but i am normally a small since it seems to run long. i think the neckline is unique :),5
Love this sweater. it fits exactly as shown on the model. the neckline is simple and stylish. the a line fit is very flattering. i normally wear a size xs to s. i purchased the s for more swing at the bottom.,5
"I love how elevenses fit and the length is awesome when i wear flats. this is one of the few brands that sometimes carries a longer 33-34"" inseam. this style is a bit shorter- however, with the lighter fabric, i wouldn't want it touching the ground. pants are breezy and i love that they are lined to the calf. call me old fashioned, but all pants should be lined! the elastic waist is nice and flat in the front and works wonderfully since my butt is larger than my waist.",5
"These are so great! love the fabric weight ( light ) they look great on - the pictures don't do these justice! i tried them on in the store with a black sleeveless crop top (you couldn't see any mid skin) and it looked great together, might have to go back and get the top! they do look great with just a black tank as well though!",5
"I've been looking for dresses to wear to nurse in since i just had a baby & so i bought this dress knowing it just had a tack holding the front fold together & always intending to remove the tack. i love it. the fabric is super soft. i wear it with a nursing tank underneath and a wide belt to cinch my waist & it's amazing. with the tack in, it did pull very strangely across the bust as others have mentioned, so it's not good for a big bust unless you intend to remove the tack & wear something un",5
"I love the weight of the material; sometimes crinkled gauze looks cheap; this does not. the lace trim is more 2-tone than the photo suggests, but that is not negative, and the color of the dress is more salmon than peach, again, not a negative. the length is as it is on the model, just below the knee. i wore it to what turned out to be surprise party for me at the beach! i paired it with huge silver hoops and silver flipflops. i felt special, stylish and comfortable. it was a good dress for some",5
"Stumbled upon this dress which had been returned to a store and was encouraged to try it on by the sales staff, and am glad i did. it's a beautiful dress that i didn't need and have no idea what i will wear it for, but bought anyway. i got a size 8 and it fits perfectly though i will need to shorten it a bit. i am busty and prefer a bit more coverage so will add more tulle to the v neck. i agree with the other reviewer about the tulle underlay but it looks easy enough to remove from the lining o",5
Most of my jeans are ag. love the ankle length and wash on these. not too distressed either. tts. really soft denim! size 27 like my other ag's,5
"I've been looking for a black sweater just like this with this comfortable material, weave",5
I love these pants! waited for them to go on sale and totally worth the price. i wore them work and received numerous compliments. great for casual friday at work or sunday brunch with the girls. can't go wrong with antro!,5
"We were at dinner in provence at sunset... and in walked a young lady wearing this lavender? dusty blue? lilac? creation- just swingy enough to be perfectly comfortable, yet lacy enough to be elegant. the color struck me as ""south-of-france"". they were american by accent. i was too shy to ask the brand of her dress, but knew by the powers of the internet that this dress would one day be mine. magnolia lace dress- i found you!!!",5
I purchased this dress in black a few months back. i was so excited to see it back in multiple colors! the black dress went well with riding boots and tights for colder temps. the yellow dress will be great in warm temps with cute sandals. super comfortable and flattering.,5
"Love this dress. it is simultaneously romantic, sexy and sweet. could be a casual dress but also worn with heels. it does run a little large but it is flowy and not meant to be super tight. i am 36d and the top isn't too tight - ordered the size 4 and am very happy with the fit.",5
"This dress is gorgeous! the color is perfect for spring/summer. the dress does run wide/loose. i read reviews before ordering and i am glad that i did. i am usually a petite size, but the reviews recommended going with the regular due to length and the design at the bottom (and wanting to be able to bend over comfortably). i am 5'2 and about 116lbs. i ordered the 2 regular and it worked well. i received many compliments!",5
"Fun and elegant!
this cape is my favorite purchase in a long time! the juxtaposition of the black and red body against the grey faux fur collar is stunning! it has brass detail snaps up and down both sides as well as at the generous pockets at natural length on both sides. it is very well made of good quality materials, as all tracey reese pieces have been in my experience.
it does run true to size as it is an oversized piece, which adds to its classy dramatic flare! it is comfortable to wear",5
This dress is lovely! so flattering. i'm 5'6 and 140 pounds pre pregnancy and just into my second trimester. purchased a 4. will work for many more months and again after baby.,5
"This is a casual, flattering off the shoulder float dress with pockets! perfect for sunday brunch or a casual night out. and, as other reviews stated the fabric is lightweight but you cannot see anything through it, except perhaps a glance of the outline of your legs but that is it. definitely not a reason to not buy this adorable dress!",5
This dress is beautiful just like the picture. it fits true to size and is quite comfortable considering it is on the delicate side. definitely recommend this one!,5
I love this sweater tunic! the neckline adds interest and is so flattering. i think it is more flattering in person than in the photos of the model. my husband even noticed the neckline and said he loves this top on me :) it is soft and not itchy at all. i bought my regular size small and will wear it with jeans or leggings and boots. i love that this neckline comes up a bit but is not huge so i can definitely pair a scarf with it for a change if i wanted to. this will definitely be a staple in,5
These pants are beautiful and so comfortable. the liner is a nice surprise. they can be casual or dressed up with a jacket. i'm so pleased to have gotten them on sale!,5
"I got this tank because it was on sale, thinking it could be cute, but i didn't have high hopes. once i put it on, i loved it. i have a long torso and it's the perfect length. i have worn it with a jacket over it also to extend its life into cooler weather.",5
I wore this with a velvet moss-colored skirt (also sold at retailer) that hits above knee and received so many compliments. the neckline and sleeves are gorgeous. i like my sweaters comfy so i ordered a medium and love it. not quite cropped but it does hit a bit higher on the waist. sleeves hit above wrist as well.,5
Agree with other reviewer that this is massive even for a cape. unflattering overall. i normally wear a size 2 of 4 and bought this in an xs and two of me can easily fit into this with room to spare. unlined and it itches!,1
"I am 5ft 8in and about 140lbs-athletic busty build. i normally wear a size 4-6. i ordered this dress in white in a size 6 and couldn't be more pleased! i actually hopped online today to try to order another in the lilac but they are unfortunately sold out. this dress is exactly as pictured-the upper back is fitted, keeping it from going out too much and looking like a straight up tent. i adore it and hope that they will re-stock it!",5
"This sweater is perfect with leggings, crop pants, jeans and wide leg pants. a line, 3/4 sleeves, does not cling to waist area... very flattering. so soft , comfortable and thick cotton knit... no cami required. length is bum covering.",5
I just discovered this dress a few days ago and it's simply dreamy!! i'd been searching for the perfect summer dress to wear to a wedding in june but had been highly disappointed in the selection of pastel colors from other shops. this dress is the perfect summer shade and will be perfect for the texas heat in june! i absolutely love how it flows and is elegant yet modest. the lace cut-outs are gorgeous!,5
"This dress is adorable. the colors are vibrant and very eye catching. i found it runs tts -- for reference i'm 5'4"" 140lbs and i ordered a 6. the dress is fitted on top with some very nice/forgiving pleats around the stomach.",5
"This dress is just absolutely adorable! you can dress it up and wear it to a wedding, or you can dress it down and slip on a pair of sandals and use it as a casual summer dress! this dress does run a tad bit large - i'm usually a size 4 but the size 4 was slightly too big for me. best purchase yet!",5
The holding horses brand never ceases to amaze me. this dress is gorgeous in person! i have received so many compliments while wearing this dress. the lace is intracately crafted and the lilac color is perfect. i actually have this magnolia dress in black as well and i might even get the new reddish color too. needless to say i'm obsessed with this dress?,5
"Love these! i wore them today for the first time and got tons of compliments. they are comfy and sooooo cute for summer. also, fyi, they make my butt look great.",5
"I purchased this dress in my normal small size - via online. i exchanged it it for a medium in the store as the shoulders were just a little too tight for me. i plan on wear it with tights/leggings as it's a little to short on my 5'9"" frame. well made and the bodice has so much detail but not over the top.",5
"I love this dress for fall. it is slightly sheer, so i would recommend wearing tights or a slip underneath, but it is lightweight enough for fall that i can transition the dress into the season as it gets colder. one note -- i am 5'1"", and was required to size down to an xs in this dress due to length. the xs is perfect for work, as it hits me slightly above my knees.",5
Kind of excited about this little number. i found it online and was immediately drawn to the boho-chic look. it arrived and i was impressed with the weight of the dress and the detailing that is missed in the photo.,5
"This is a great, easy-to-wear dress with lovely beaded detailing all over the front bodice and ladder lace trim running the length of the sleeves. easily dressed up or down. i usually wear petites but ordered the regular size based on previous reviews, and the slightly longer length was perfect for me (it hit just above the knees). there were a few beads that were coming a little loose, so i did have to secure those but it wasn't a big deal for me as i'm pretty comfortable with light mending, et",5
"This dress is beautiful - the pattern is pretty and the beading detail is stunning. i immediately received many compliments the first day i wore it. i do think it is a little short so i bought a size up (i also like loose fitting clothing) and i wore it with bare legs and boots and felt ok, will likely add leggings or tights as the weather gets cooler.",5
"This dress is more beautiful in person than it is online. during the fall/winter i love to wear dresses with tights and pair them with boots. this dress is so cute, the material is pretty thin, but lined and flowey, i am 5'9 34 b bra 27 inch waist and a size 2 was great. the dress itself is pretty shapeless but string around the waist is adjustable to make it fit you the right way (giving it some shape) the v neckline is definitely more attractive in person than in the pictures, and the stitchin",5
"Wore this to work and nearly everyone complimented me on it. very comfortable. lots of detailing. perfect for fall. pockets! i'm usually somewhere between a s and m but this piece was generously cut and a s was perfect. i debated ordering the petite, but actually the regular cut was the perfect length even though i'm only 5'4"".",5
"This dress was one of those incidental finds i saw in-store while making an online return. for whatever reason i didn't notice this one online but loved it in person. the fit is easy going and flattering, i took a small as the shoulder fit would've been a little tight in the xs. great dress for transitioning seasons :)",5
"I grabbed this immediately when i saw it in the store - the details are beautiful - beading, embroidery, and small opening details on the arms. from a practicality standpoint, it has pockets, it's machine washable, and it can easily be worn as is, with black leggings or tall boots in fall, and then throw an additional chunky ivory cardigan on for winter. for sizing, i am usually a size s and found it to fit loosely, but in comfortable slightlyyyy swingy way. if i had sized down the shoulder seam",5
"I was not so sure i would like this dress as i was afraid it may be too boxy looking. per other reviews i took a chance...i love it!
so sweet with my grey boots and just dressy enough...but still casual and fun.
detail work is very nicely done.",5
This dress is beautiful and extremely well made. there is s little more weight to the fabric than i had assumed but it's nice for fall/transition/cooler temps. i'm so sad that i will most likely return this dress because it's just not working on my postpartum body but there is a part of me that wants to keep it because of how stunning it is.,5
"I agree with the other reviewer who said she cannot believe it's not flying off the shelf. this looks gorgeous on and the fit is perfect. i ordered my usual size m. i am 5'3"" 34dd and it looks amazing. it is breezy and flowing but without the baggy look. it is so cute with jeans or leggings. the fabric is the perfect weight- light but still thick enough that it's comfortable and my light bra is not seen underneath. love this top!!!",5
Great dress. fits perfectly. will be perfect in the winter and with leggings.,5
"The dress is as great 'in person' as it shows in the pictures. if you usually buy petite keep in mind that you may like the regular size if you prefer the llonger look. if you prefer a shorter length go for the petite size if this is what you usually get. i am 5.3, 117 lbs and tried both, xs regular and xs petite. i ultimately went with the regular size as i preferred the longer length.
everything about this dress is perfect, the color, the material, the cut. highly recommended as a transition",5
Love this so much. it's beautiful and i get tons of compliments. it's a touch short as a dress but looks amazing with leggings!,5
Love these! they are thick and comfortable. they feel like sweat pants but are cute enough to wear out if you are running quick errands. definitely recommend!,5
These are so comfy. i will wear them for 3 seasons. so worth it - especially on sale.,5
"This dress is amazing beautiful and perfect for fall. the colors and beading are so much better in person. the pockets are an added bonus! i'm typically a xs but sized up to a s only because i felt the sleeves were tight and across the bust was tighter than i'd like when moving my arms. the xs would have worked but the s is perfect comfort. i highly recommend this beauty. for reference, i'm 5'2, 120 lbs.",5
"Absolutely love this jumpsuit. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits perfectly (i am typically an xs/00). when i read previous reviews i was quite excited to read that most people found it to be ""short waisted""-- the waist band actually hits my natural waist (just how it is pictured on the model), which never happens! great quality, thick fabric and the pleats in the front are beautiful. can't wait to wear it!",5
"This is absolutely beautiful.  but i am only 5'6""and the dress hits my thigh about the same place as it does on the model. one lean over to pick up my purse off the floor and i will flash everyone.   so i am going to wear it with dark denim leggings and tall boots.   likewise i did not detect even a speck of black. to me it is navy and purple. i was wishing it had black because those are my favorite leggings but quite honestly i think you're going to have to do navy or denim.",5
"Bought this at sale price. pretty in person and soft / comfortable. runs really big. size down.
i got it in my usual size l, but will have to exchange for an m.",5
"This shirt is boxy. but, as the pictures clearly shows, that is the design of it. if you know how to style outfits, it's a great buy. i really like it. i'm tall and slender, so it's a bit easier for me to pull this off. the design and color are just really neat. really cool shirt for the fall.",5
"I did buy these when they were 40% off the sale price. well worth it. they are comfortable, thick but not too warm. they are my 'nice' home pants to wear outside. =) i love them. i got a large and they fit on the baggy side but not bad. i'm usually a large or xl.",5
"A culotte and basketball short hybrid. these culottes are heaven....very comfortable. the are great on windy summer days or walking around the city (between the buildings are like wind tunnels). the waist does run alittle large...i have a 29-30in waist and the medium petite fit my lower waist, but is large on my natural waist...a small petite would be better, so size down one size on the waist. plus the waist band is stretchy, so there is a lot of forgiveness in sizing down. plus the petite's le",5
Love this dress!! will go from fall to winter. so comfy. got it in medium.. and fits great.,5
"Very flattering! i am petite, but have large breasts. so, i expected this dress to look boxy on me. but the flowy fabric falls perfectly on the body and shows just the right amount of shape. the pattern is beautiful and perfect for the cooler seasons. the dress is also very versatile. it can be dressed up with heels and a jacket, or down with flats and a denim vest or jacket. i know i'm going to wear this dress over and over this fall and winter.",5
"There is so much going on on this dress - it's fantastic. hard to tell from pics - but there is a peek-a-boo lattice detail going down the front and back of the sleeves. the beading is plentiful but not too much for work. dress is significantly longer on me than the model - i'm 5'6"", but still a tad above the knee. with tall boots or booties and tights, this will go straight from work to out for the evening. i'm real long waisted - originally ordered m, but exchanged for l. much better fit overa",5
This dress is so much better in person than pictures. details on the sleeves and buttons on the front shows quality and makes it an original looking dress. i've wore it yesterday for the first time and received 4 compliments. buy before it sells out!,5
"Great knee length, lovely twirl and drape. though a staple piece, the material and the blend of the navy and black bring this skirt up a notch. pull on styling. i purchased a small and returned it for an extra small as it was too large in the waist. i like my skirts to sit at the natural waist and with the style of this skirt, i think that would look most flattering and slimming. my waist is abt 26/27 for reference (34c bust and hips abt 35/36) and typically a 2/4 at retailer. the skirt is quite s",5
"I skipped over these when they first cme in store, but it was reccomended to me to try them on. so i did, and i loved them, they look like a skirt which is amazing but you won't be worrying on those breezy days ;) they run very big!!!! i'm usually a 26/27 or 2/4 in pants and i got the xs and feel like i could have even sized down but that's the smallest size carried in store. i got them in the green because i felt that the color went more with the casual feel of the pant. if you are interested i",5
"Nice feminine pattern with a thick fabric. it's great having pockets! the white is ivory. i'm a size 4, and the small fits nicely. it would be nice, if the pant length was a little longer. i have a 31"" inseam, and they end up being a couple of inches above my ankle, but that's just my preference. overall, very happy with this purchase.",5
Super cute style but runs slightly larger then other ag jeans i have.,5
"This feels and looks like a ballet skirt on, so light and flowy, super comfortable, just love it! extremely flattering cut, tiny gathered folds at waistband add pretty detail and create a slimming effect on my tummy, what's not to love?! great pockets too! i have a 34 inseam and the length is perfect. ordering in both colors now as i can see these becoming my go to bottoms all summer long....",5
"Runs true to size for brand/retailer clothes (xs for 5'5"", ~120lbs), but a little tight in the shoulders/biceps if you have fairly developed muscles or just wide shoulders. watch out for the skirt riding up when you reach for something or bend over.",5
"I bought this dress for an october wedding in savannah, ga. i love it! can be dressed up or down. i'm 5'3"" and 112 lbs and bought an xs. like other reviewers said, it's a little tight through the arms. i probably could have done an xxs but wouldn't be as comfortable. i'd recommend this dress to anyone looking for a versatile dress for fall and winter.",5
"I noticed this outfit earlier this year and remarked to my husband how heavenly it was. i couldn't bring myself to buy it since i shy away from strapless outfits (this lady is a small chested diva). to my delight- my wonderful husband remembered my gushing, and surprised me with this outfit for christmas! imagine a 33-year-old dancing around the house holding up this outfit - because that is what happened. this outfit it truly a work of art. it has a lined bodice with soft boning that fits perfe",5
"I am here online to buy this pant in both colors. i tried it on today in store in regular lengh,, but am opting for petite size. i am 5'2. i could have purchased the regular length, which hit me above the ankle, but i think p will be more flattering and better for summer.

the pants are a woven material, and kindof shiny!? the pants also may be a bit see-thru in sunshine due to the structure of weave. that said, i am buying them anyways because they are that comfortable and professional. i may",5
Nice skirt. texture pattern gives it character. does run a bit large.,5
"Love!!!! i was super hesitant to try this dress on, it didn't look great online or on the hanger. but it looked great on! it has a very boho/70s/vintage feel. i am curvy, and it looked fabulous.",5
"I fell in love with these bottoms at first site. i was a little worried they would not work for me because i'm a curvy size 12/14, but to my surprise they look great! i tried on the large as that is what i usually wear at retailer, but i was able to size down to a medium - which was great cause it minmized some of the fullness for me. they are light and breezy and will be the perfect alternative from shorts - which i hate. they are so worth trying!!",5
"This dress is beautiful, and the a line shape is very flattering. i'm 5'10"" and it hits just above my knees. i'm small on top, so the keyhole slit isn't an issue for me, but it does gap more than it does on the model. this dress has lots of versatility.  like another reviewer said, you can dress it up with heels, or dress it down with boots.",5
"I almost did not buy this dress because of the poly/rayon construction but i saw some sweet styling on instagram that got me hooked. the dress is silky soft and a bit oversized as i purchased the smallest of my size range. looks very swingy and free spirited when worn loose. cinch the string tie or add a wide belt for a defined waist and beautiful full skirt. i have many outfits in mind for this perfect fall dress, i'm excited to start wearing it! my weight has been fluctuating, so right now i'm",5
"This beautiful dress is the perfect style for fall. when i first picked this up, i was surprised by how heavy it felt. there is so much embroidery i thought the dress was lined with another layer. however, the fabric is not stiff. there are numerous exquisite details including a button up bodice, additional embroidery on the skirt and ladder lace on the sleeves. 


i sized up to l because of my heavy back/shoulders/upper arms. sizing up does make the bodice of the dress look a tad wider but n",5
"This dress is truly a no brainer purchase! it is a stunning dress with gorgeous embroidery, beading and  the color is just perfect for fall! i am only 5'2 and i went with the regular size since i don't like to go too short. that said, you can totally rock this dress with leggings and boots if it is too short. i weigh 103 lbs and i am normally an xxs but i'm glad i went with the xs since it would have been too tight at the top and should even  be slightly loose fitting on the bottom. love everyth",5
"This is a great tunic for those of us who like to wear leggings as pants once in a while, it covers all the important parts without being too baggy. i found the fabric to be light and comfortable, but heavy enough that a light colored bra can't be seen underneath with it great if you don't feel like wearing multiple layers.",5
"I am floored by all of the positive comments about these culottes! i can see that they would work for someone who is rail thin and has no hips... but for those of us with curves (i'm a size 12, hourglass), these are very unflattering. they made me look like i was carrying an extra 20-30 pounds, just around the hips! so bummed because they look so cute on the model.",1
Nice top; the material is soft and drapey. i like to wear it layered under a shorter shirt or jacket.,5
I am usually a regular xs with retailer tops. i took a chance and went with the xxs in blue and am not regretting it. super comfortable top. fits perfect and will be great for work.,5
"I loved it but can understand the mixed reviews. i am 5'7"" and a size 2-4 usually. 32d. you need to be on the tall side for it to work. definitely will not work if you are petite. i can also see if you have a fuller chest how it would tent and look like a maternity top. i have that happen with off the shoulder styles. that said, if it works, it is great. i didn't size down went with s) because the xs didn't hang well. it was too short at the shoulders and neckline. again, probably need to be in",5
"I am in love with this dress. the colors are amazing but also is the fabric. it is soft and supple. i am a curvy girl and this dress does all justice to my bust, waist, and hips. this is truly an amazing dress. you can dress it up or dress it down and the best part it is professional enough for a causal office look.",5
"I adore this little sweater- the pictures don't do it justice. i'm tall, with broad shoulders and small chest- the cut and design of this sweater is so flattering. colors work with denim or any neutral, and the weight is perfect for spring or early summer.",5
"This is the prettiest little nighty. it is romantic, soft and so very pretty. i really adore everything about this piece , but the pink detail on the trim, along with the floral embroidery is are just the right extra touches that retailer shoppers have come to love.",5
Love this sweater! it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease. very soft and seems durable. i highly recommend it!,5
"Soft very forgiving and flattering top, wish it was not so pricey",5
"I love elosie sleepwear, everything is well made and beautiful designs. i am 5'5"" and wear a size 4, the small fits great. i love the embroidery it is a nice touch, and the pink is a pretty contrast.",5
"This is one of those pieces of clothing that is destined to become a wardrobe staple.
the fabric is soft and generous. . the chiffon trim gives it swing and style.
i just ordered another one because i know it is going to be a long time favorite..",5
I love the off the shoulder tee so much that i ordered two of them in different colors. i can wear them with jeans or i can wear them with gym attire while out running errands and still feel like i look nice!,5
"Love this dress! adorable, comfortable and figure flattering! cant go wrong with this purchase!",5
"I tried this on in the store because i have had my eye on it for a while and i want to be sure i get the correct size. as other reviewers have said, it does run large. i normally wear a s and the xs was big on me. i could go with the xxs, but of course it appears to be sold out now. the lighter colors look like they would be slightly sheer, but the navy blue and red are not. i thought the material was good quality. not sure if it would shrink. top is rather long on the back, but the picture does",5
"I'm 5' 3"", 115 pounds, and bought the xs in white. i actually wear this as a bathing suit cover-up instead of a top. i love that it's little longer in the back so it covers part of the back of my thighs. it's light weight, cool and comfortable. it is thin but has washed well with no pilling or holes so far. i've worn this several times and have had lots of compliments.",5
"I have been watching this dress online since it arrived, finally decided to order it online. it is as great in person as it looks on the website. the fabric, cut and finishing of the dress are high quality and my usual size 10 fits great. it falls about 3"" above the knee on my 5'5"" frame which is a little short for the office, but i could do it on a friday with a cardigan. the fit is comfortable and flattering for a gal with broad shoulders and small curves. when i tried it on friends raved. thi",5
"Runs a little big, but super comfortable and looks great with jeans slightly tucked in.",5
"This picture does not due this sweater justice, at all! i purchased this today for summer. it's beyond cute and the colors are awesome! it's a very light sweater with a fitted (but not too tight) light feel. the sleeves are a little longer than quarter length, at least on me. it looks amazing with white pants, very fresh!!",5
I bought this in an extra small at a store in the lilac color and loved it so much i ordered a white one online 2 days later. they were out of extra sm so i ordered a small which is still ok as it looks cute being on the big flowy side with my jeans. i normally wear a medium in tops. i've received many compliments on these... they are very figure flattering and it's nice they are a little sexy for a loose top because of the open shoulders. i hope they come out with more colors for summer because,5
"I love this brand and their different styles of tshirts. extremely soft, washes well and wears well! the shirt runs a bit large and i usually wear a medium, but in this brand i am a extra small or small.",5
"I love this tee, i own it and wear it nearly every other day in black and purple solids and ordered 2 of the prints. wish that the purple/gray floral print would restock since it sold out before i could purchase it. only possible negative is that i am careful not to tumble dry it due to other reviews of its vulnerability to tears or holes. so i hang it up to dry after machine washing. i read that it runs a bit large so i ordered and am thrilled with my medium.",5
This is better than the original tla t shirts from last summer. better quality/not sheer. great fit! i bought both the white and the purple. love tla tees!,5
T la is such a great brand for t shirts! this one is so soft and comfy and the yellow color is a great neutral yellow.,5
I bought this tee in most of the colors available. that's how much i liked it. it's not tissue thin; it's a good medium weight. it does't hug the body too closely. i am 5'4 and 140 lbs with a little post partum belly and this is a really flattering tee in m.,5
"Easy, breezy comfortable light weight tee",5
"Incredibly soft, great to dress up or dress down. i must have summer tee.",5
"I picked up this tee in store, where they had a pattern that isn't pictured here (purple floral on a grey background). this is a loose fitting tee, and usually the loose fitting tees i try on at retailer are really unflattering- however, this one fits great and is flattering. the fabric is wrinkle resistant and comfortable. this top will definitely be a staple of my spring and summer wardrobe! considering ordering in other colors.

for reference, i'm 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 measurements, 34ddd",5
"A perfect basic tee!
loved how soft it is. not worth full price, but definitely one to add to your cart once on sale.",5
"I've never bought a tee at full price, in so many colors. i love this tee.it's quite possibly the most perfect fit ever. the material is thick and hangs well without being stiff or bulky. i'm 5'2 -117lbs usually a small petite or 4p but purchased the regular small so i can wear this with skinny or regular jeans. i purchased the purple, navy and black and may go back for the yellow. the white is still a little too sheer fir me otherwise i would have purchased it. wish they had a light grey versio",5
"I love these t.la tees, and i buy them often. i find them to be very versatile and super soft. i have several colors and they hold up well if you wash and hang dry. i am a small in most retailer tops and these are no exception. they wear well under jean jackets or even a long-sleeve button-down shirt.",5
"I'm extremely pleased with the quaiity of these leggings. the material is comfortable and supportive without feeling too restrictive. the pattern ans styling are slimming. most importantly, they don't slide down during your workout! i'm 5'8'' and a size 12-14 and the large fit perfectly.",5
I got this in the color listed as pink. it's not a usual pink. the fit is good--not too tight and not too loose. the length is good for a tee.,5
"I'm a petite so as usual i have to order from retailer. i saw this on line and tried it on in a regular size in the store. even though of course it didnt fit, the style of the tee was nice so i ordered it. i couldnt have been more disappointed when i received it. the quality was truly awful. i'm not even sure why it is being sold. the neckline was warped and wouldn't lie flat again the neck or chest; the bottom hem was crooked. it was really bad. also having purchased tees in similar material befo",1
"I just received this swimsuit today and love it!  i was a little hesitant to order with the cutouts, but i feel it is very flattering.
i was choosing between an xs and s.  i ended up going with xs and am glad i did, i think going up would of caused gaping on the sides.

great suit, only comment is in the description i believe it said the straps are adjustable, but they are not.  also, there is light padding which i appreciate.",5
"Denim is a little heavier than my other pilcro stet jeans, but i love the wash and the broken-in wear on the upper legs and pocket. i mostly appreciate how little they stretch out during the day, just enough to be comfortable but without losing their shape. they seem a bit more fitted in the hips than the waist. but, i prefer jeans that aren't tight in the waist, so these are perfect for me. i purchased the same size as all my other jeans and they fit just fine. i am 5'6"" and the hem fell right",5
"I love this t-shirt! it is so soft, fits true to size and great with jeans or shorts. i purchased in yellow and plan to purchase other colors!",5
"This is comfy and casual and fun to wear.  moss ombrã© is darker and less ombrã© than pictured, so i wish i had gotten the other color way instead.  i can see myself wearing this for running errands, grabbing take-out and other important things like hanging out on my couch.  definitely size down or this will look too wide & boxy.",5
"I was worried this sweater would be too tight, but it has a very flattering fit. i am a librarian and this sweater makes me feel like a quirky librarian. i love it!",5
I found these jeans on the sale rack at my local retailer. they were the very last pair and in my size. i couldn't believe my luck.  i tried them on and was very impressed with the fit and feel of the jeans. thyre soft yet substantial. they retain thier shape. . love the worn in look to them.  .. .. so adorable.  nice slouchy skinny jean.. i stayed true to size,5
"I love these jeans! they actually look better than the picture and you cannot beat the sale price. they are a boyfriend fit, but you can order your normal size. usually with boyfriends, i have to order one to two sizes down. with skinnies and more fitted jeans, i am a 29 and that's what i got. there is no sagging or stretching out after wearing them for a while. the wash is absolutely beautiful...very worn. hopefully the holes in the knees won't get even bigger. i have worn and washed them now q",5
I get nervous ordering clothes online but that was my only option for this dress. i love everything about this dress and i love the pockets.,5
"I ordered both colors, but ended up keeping the green in petite xs b/c the red in xs was just slightly too big. both colors are gorgeous, and i agree they have a retro 70's vibe. just a tad itchy, but not enough that it would make an undershirt absolutely necessary. i'll probably just wear it alone. i think the regular size would work for most petites b/c it's not ridiculously long. i would suggest sizing down in regular if you're petite though: for instance, the regular xs fit noticeably larger",5
"This skirt is great, a classic. the little dots on the skirt give it some character while remaining a simple black and flattering skirt. the material lays nicely and flat. it does not make me look like i have a stomach. the skirt fits tts. i am a little afraid that the waistband will stretch out over time so i might exchange it for one size smaller. overall, i love the skirt!",5
"As the previous reviewer mentioned, the pockets ruin this dress. pockets, usually such a good idea! but here they're misplaced (right on the hips) and made of the same thick ponte fabric as the dress, so they stand out far from the body and completely ruin the line of the dress... not flattering to have huge gaping hip pockets. this makes an otherwise good dress a total loss.",1
"Absolute best pair of yoga pants. they are the softest material- so comfy! i'm 5'3, 125lbs with a curvy figure and the m fit perfectly :)",5
This reminds me of the 1970's. the fabric is soft and it looks just like the picture. i'm ordering it in line in a petite. my store doesn't carry petites. it's typical moth quality and fit. perfect.,5
"Very long shirt, i have to tuck it in. i love the lipstick design and its great quality material. its really soft and cotton breathable.",5
"This is quite possibly the greatest jacket of all time. i ordered it with the ""layered luna dress"" in grey, and i am now giddy with excitement to wear the combo! very chic. i am confident this will be a staple in the years to come. for reference, i ordered my normal size xs (5'5, 115 lbs, muscular) and did not find it to be too tight in the arms (and i have fairly broad shoulders). i did not try it on with long sleeves, but i still think there would be adequate room.",5
"This is an amazing jacket! it fits perfectly through the shoulders, with enough give to make it comfortable. i love the color and the feel of it, as well. it will be perfect for the spring and summer evenings.",5
"Absolutely love this jacket - soft, nice amount of stretch, and the fit is beautiful. i'm 5'7"" with a long torso and was happy with the length on this too (motos are sometimes tricky for me). totally cute and versatile - worth full price!",5
"I love this jacket. it has great structure and lays nicely, while still have knit arms and a lining. don't try this on if you aren't prepared to buy it because it's amazing. color is more of an olive than a khaki to me as it appears in this picture. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small fit perfectly. definitely consider this as an investment piece across many seasons.",5
"Ordered this jacket in the holly color thinking it would be brown per the photo but when it arrived it was more olive green. it is a beautiful, well-made jacket but i already have two olive green jackets?don?t need a third. if they bring this jacket out in brown i will definitely order. i order the xs and it fit perfectly.",5
"I bought the navy/ivory patterned one in size 16. i loved the details of the faces so much that i ordered a second one in the same pattern on sale. now, i see they're still available on clearance so i have a 3rd (the ivory with pastel stripes). the length is perfect. it's comfortable, washes well, and has personality. i love these. i should have bought the other whimsical prints. i've had good use out of them this summer and will in the colder months too.",5
Got this on a whim and boy i'm very pleased! it's flattering and the material is perfect for spring weather. size up as mentioned by other reviewers.,5
"So i ordered both sizes in this, small and xs.  i'm 128 lbs. and 5""4 and the xs fit me.  at first i wasn't sure about this piece but after getting it on it starts to grow on you.  the top part of the jumper fits really cute and the bottoms are very wide and can be long.  i did get this at a great price so i'm going to keep it, don't know how many times i will end up wearing but thought it would be really cute to wear out on date night with my husband.",5
I agree with the others...this is the type sweater that hooked me on retailer ten years ago. i love my new sweater. i do recommend wearing a long sleeve tee underneath. the sleeves are itchy.,5
"This tank is well made and the top part is doubled (partially) so you can get away without wearing a bra (if you wish). i'm 5'1 and tried on the standard xs in store because xxs was not available. it was a little bit longer on me than on the model pictured. the pin-tucked area fit well, not too tight or loose and the bottom part was flowy which i don't mind. i expect this top to shrink in the wash a tad which would make it perfect for me. i opted for the white vs. the black because i love the pi",5
"This bra is obviously very pretty and feminine, but i was surprised that it's also really comfortable! it provides a pretty good amount of support, especially for an unlined bra, and feels pretty sturdy despite there not being much there. my 34b fit true to size.",5
"I love this sweater! aside from it being absolutely adorable, the quality is great and the sizing is accurate. i have received so many compliments on it so far and honestly, i want to wear it everyday! the sweater is super soft and comfy... and of course, i totally recommend it! thanks retailer!!",5
"I love the design and color of this jacket. when i saw it pictured, i thought it was a vest. the sleeves and collar are made of a contrasting type of fabric; the sleeves are a knit but fit in very well with the design of the jacket.
i ordered a small because i had ordered a small in a vest made by the same manufacturer. 
this jacket runs smaller, the sleeves were very tight , and overall it was just too small. had to return it.",5
"This brand makes the best jackets. i got a vest from them last year and an olive moto jacket. both fit amazing. this one is no different. it fits great!! love that it's a great casual jacket with structure and drape. i can't say enough good things about this jacket. every time i wear it, i feel so pulled together. fun light gray color that you don't see too often in jackets. this is a jacket i see in my wardrobe for years to come. must have.",5
"Comments. the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve. and the quality is there with the lining. trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape. imo, you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank. i looked at the model (after purchasing) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not, it is terribly unflattering.",1
"I bought this top in the black with the dobby 4"" shorts in grey and wore them as a set 2 of the 3 days last weekend.
mind you, i am tall, but the neckline is lovely, the smocking creates a nice close drape, and the length and the fullness in the bottom, perfectly offset the short-short concept. got lots of compliments with the 2. 
i generally wear a 12 and ordered a medium which was fit nicely with enough room for a wash and dry going forward",5
"I absolutely love this blouse. it is so soft, easy to wear and can be worn with so many things. i'm 5'3, 135 pounds and got a small (regular). i could've gone for the petite but decided to do regular. love it!",5
"First off this jacket is more of a greenish hue in person (which i personally love over the tan). i was not sure how the sleeves would be after a few wears since they are not canvas, but they are holding up and not stretching out. there is fleece inside the sleeves for extra warmth since it is not the best layering jacket. overall, if you're considering this jacket, take the plunge like i did. order your usual size for perfect fit or size up if you're hoping to layer.",5
"I loved this jacket it is very cute until i washed it! i followed the care instructions and it still does not wash well. the arms shrank about half an inch making them a little short, i have been rolling them up",5
"Hi, i bought this top for my daughter. she absolutely loves it. the fabric is very substantial. it flows really nice. if i was younger i would buy one for myself. lol",5
"Took a chance without trying it on and ordered online...i love everything about this sweater!!! fit is on the spot, details are pretty and wonderful! try it, you won't be disappointed.",5
"This is my third marrakech jacket in as many months. i love it! i was hesitant to order it because of the beige color. luckily it is more of a green beige. it is a very flattering jacket and yes, you do want to size up. this jacket is so comfortable i usually leave it on when i get home because i don't want to take it off. i am 5'5"", 34 b and the medium fits great!",5
"Hi there, 
if you are looking for a shirt you can wear all summer long; this is it! soft, a little darker than shown in the picture (which i like better), and super comfortable. it also keeps me cool in these hot june temperatures. a great blouse to throw on with shorts or white jeans, and it can easily be dressed up for casual fridays at work. it is definitely oversized, but no more so than all clothes these days. i stuck with a size small and usually wear a size 4/6 in tops. so, if you are ti",5
This looks just as pictured. it's comfortable but dressy. i love it!,5
"I am really impressed with the workmanship of this jacket as well as the ""fit."" it really does fit me well and has a ""cool"" look. the quality is really worth the price. thank you retailer!!",5
"I saw this in store, but they didn't have my size and i balked at the price. however, i kept thinking about it and once i received it from online i now think it's well worth it. the quality is very nice and it fits tts. i like that the arm materials is stretchy. i've worn this with jeans, but will also wear it with a skirt to the office. it's got enough weight to function as a light spring jacket. the color matches the photo and is a nice neutral to go with many things.",5
"I bought this tank on a whim without trying it on in the store, in black. the detail on the front is cute and the peplum is really cute without being frumpy at all. i am usually a small, ocassionally a medium in retailer shirts and i bought this in small. it fits but i feel like i could have gone up to a medium, it's just a little tight across the chest, but i do have more broad shoulders than most so maybe it's just because of that. the fabric is nice and stretchy, so i might be able to get away",5
"This dress is really lovely in person. the fit was perfect and the length not too short. for reference, i'm very busty at 38f and the dress actually fit! (i'm an xl usually, and the fit was tts) the only thing i'm not crazy about is the slip, it's more of a flesh toned color. i'll probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these, retailer!",5
This is such a beautiful dress. fell in love with it at first sight. it is very pretty. can be dressed up or down .. comes with an attached slip that is a tad longer than the dress and it shows on the bottom.. darling dress that will get lots of use this summer.,5
As in super comfortable and a joy to wear. i saw it online and then went to the store to try it on. the moment i put it on i knew it was for me. i missed out on getting it in the other color. i hope you get more in other colors!,5
"Fell in love at first site, cozy and wonderful design that creates a slim line even with full figure.",5
Love the quality and fit! it runs small so i got one size bigger.,5
"I absolutely love these sleepwear pants. they are lightweight, soft, good fit and quality and the design is really pretty!! a steal at this price.",5
"Cute and super comfortable...so it's the best of both worlds. it fits true to size, but i bought a size up to add a little extra length. love the soft blue color and ruffles.",5
"This dress is great! it's the perfect transition piece from summer to fall. it is very comfortable. the material and fit are similar to an oversized sweatshirt. overall, i love it.",5
"I love this blouse. it's a tad more billowy than i would have thought but looks fine. to wear to work i need to wear a camisole underneath as it's a bit sheer. and the button at the back of the neck broke immediately, but is still functional. the decorative part fell off. they give you a replacement button so if i decide it matters i'll sew that one on.

i absolutely love the blue stitching on this and how crisp it is. i didn't realize it was dry clean only but that doesn't bother me.",5
"After seeing an influx of this dress in my instagram feed i decided to go ahead and purchase it last weekend. i'm usually leery with the length of swing dresses, for instance the endora swing dress (paper crown) is a touch too short for my taste in petite sizing. either way, i decided to go ahead and purchase this dress in petite considering no previous reviews mentioned the length of the dress to be an issue. 

typically, i take a size 0 or xs in retailer clothing. i ordered a size 0 petite and",5
"The price was worth the splurge, free shipping and a special discount helped. the minute i laid my eyes on this sweater i was hooked. light, airy weight and that handmade texture make the overall design something special. this is the kind of sweater that has enduring style. the big kangaroo pockets scared me a little, which i have determined to be not a distraction after trying it on.",5
"I just bought this pretty dress at my local retailer after finally deciding to go in the store to try it on. once i saw it on display in the window in the lilac, i already knew i was going to try that one on and take it home though i really love both colors and prints. the dress fit me tts (sz 6, 34d-27-35) and looks absolutely adorable on! it's super soft, light weight but not so much that you don't feel it's worth the price and the design reminds me of the retailer i love. it has a wonderful vinta",5
"This is a gorgeous bathing suit. the colours are more brilliant than the ones in the picture, and much more beautiful. comfortable, chic, and unique",5
"Tried this is my normal 4, and it fits exactly as shown. i can see how this could give issues to someone with any curves because the lining is definitely more fitted than the loose overlay, especially in the bust and hips. i found the quality to be very nice, length was slightly above the knee on my 5'7"" frame so it feels work-appropriate. my only wish is that the colors/pattern could transition better to multiple seasons. it definitely feels very springy and not much else.",5
"I cannot say enough about these pajama pants. they're beautiful and crazy comfortable. it's a nice change from black or grey. i also love that there are no pockets because i hate how they jut out on me. i wanted a petite l because i am short, but the regular large is fine. i just wear them higher up on my hips. i normally wait for sales on sleepwear, but i couldn't resist on these. they're well worth the investment!",5
"I bought this in the store because it was irresistible. generally i only buy sale merchandise but this item is unlikely to ever hit the sale racks. the colors are delicious - they go with everything in the grey-rose-blue pallet. the fabric is superb, heavy and glossy, good for cold weather. the size is generous in the upper body (not so much in the hips). i usually take a small or medium. there were only smalls left in the store so i couldn't try an xs. the reversible inside fabric is a complete",5
"Definitely shorter than expected, but a super light, airy, and comfy dress for summer nights. a must for summer dinner parties!!!",5
"I bought this after eyeing it for months, when it went on sale! the colors are bright and so pretty! the blue very warm, flattering in intensity. this pattern is very unique and the suit is well made. there is some stretch, making it not a chore to pull on.  the bust padding is minimal (like a tshirt bra) best for a & small b cups. no underwire no shaping in cups. the halter has enough room to be comfortable and secure. i felt this fit more like a 0 on the bottom (hips) and a 2 for top portion,",5
Totally see through.,1
"This vest was a must-have the minute i saw it! i usually stick to the sale section, but this was a worthy exception. i love the reversible option! i bought the matching leggings as well, and have worn them with the smaller floral motif...so many compliments! i teach barre, so i figured i would wear this to and from the studio, but i find myself reaching for it to go over all my regular clothes too! the only draw back is the zipper. i'm sure its because it is reversible, however, the zipper hasn'",5
"So nice to switch it up from all my black and gray sweats. these are luxuriously soft, and so so comfortable. they are light weight and beautiful. i am 5'5 , 125 and i am very happy with the size xs i purchased . was deciding between xs and s and i am happy i went with the xs. worth every penny. you won't regret. also , finally - perfect length .",5
Beautiful warm vest. originally bought small but had to exchange for extra small. i love that it reversible and has a hood.,5
"Seeking the perfect ""go-to"" dress? this one will work for day or night, and it's an ideal match for transition seasons. the best part? the cut. swing dresses and shifts can ""tent"" my slightly ""top-heavy"" frame. this dress brags a side-zipper and slight tapering through waist to create an a-line. the small petite fits tts for me at 5'4 size 2 to 4. the fabric is a high-quality, textured fabric - wrinkle free, and a great pick for travel. best investment i've made this spring.",5
Saw this in store and knew i gotta have it! beautiful colors and slimming effect.,5
"These pants are great. i am 5'6"" and 133lbs. i normally wear medium for athletic bottoms. medium fits well except knee pit area. maybe because they are not very stretching fabric. however, they are still flattering. the material was thick enough and their print hides underwear lines.",5
I saw this dress in the lilac at the store and loved it immediately! the picture on the website does not do it justice.,5
"Beautiful and very versatile dress. extremely forgiving for post baby bodies, while stylish and classy.",5
These super cute leggings are comfortable and functional with a fun design!,5
"After seeing this dress online i wanted to try it on and was not disappointed when i did. even though the coral color dress of the same style was pretty it wasn't the right color for me. i absolutely love the blue and white dress! i usually wear a size 8 but found the 6 was more flattering. i'm 5'2"" and the length was perfect - above the knee but not too high. love it!",5
"Adorable & comfortable. i'm 5'3"" and 115 lbs and ordered an xs. it hits at my knees & is loose fitting, but not tent like.",5
This dress is very thick cotton material. like a sweatshirt. i was hoping to wear this to a wedding but it is a tunic at best. the bell part of the sleeves also stick out awkwardly because of the fabric.,1
I couldn't resist this basic white button down with the cute side buttons that added some interest. i bought my usual size large and it fit perfectly. the soft substantial fabric from cloth and stone never disappoints. i love the longer cut since i'm 5-10 and love a long shirt to hide the belly pudge. the blue is darker than the online picture shows and i'll probably be going back for that but at almost $100 i'm hoping it'll go on sale.,5
"I love this dress. it is the kind of dress that i dream about. the feel is young and carefree. typically i love swing dresses on the tall thin models pictured but when i try them on i simply look frumpy. this dress is an exception. i have the lilac version and the fabric color and pattern enhance the boho pixie fairy aesthetic. for reference i am 5'4"" 122 lbs...average build a little busty 34dd. only the 6 was in stock so that is the size i ordered even though i wanted to try the 4. the 6 has en",5

"Comfortable, decent quality and very casual",5
"I am quite happy with this dress! i was wondering what the colors would look like in person, and i'm happy to report that the skirt is a nice mellow orange-coral. beautiful detail in the patterns used here, and i always like a dress that has great color-play close up and far away. for reference, i am a size 16, full figured, with a 40 c bust, and the size 16 was just right for me. sometimes with maeve dresses you can size down, but there is no stretch to the dress, or the slip, so that is someth",5
"Sometimes i feel like i have to try on the dresses that sell out super fast, just out of curiosity. and sometimes, they're surprise hits, like this one. i tried on the purple/black/blue option, and i had to have it. it is boxy through the torso, but the length keeps it from being too cutesy--it's pretty short. i'm just 5'5"", and i'm not sure this is work appropriate without tights. i may have to try, though, as otherwise it's a great workable dress for summer--not too tight or revealing in the b",5
"I absolutely love this dress!! i bought it in the blue , the brown and the pink colors.. it is incredibly flattering. the one interesting thing that i found is that the pink dress seemed to run smaller than the other colors. so happy with the style and i have gotten so many compliments when i where them :)",5
"I bought one of each color. love them all! they fit well and are very soft. washing and drying them are not a big issue either. i didn't notice any shrinking. i wear xs and s depending on the fabric and cut. for this, i bought a small. (i'm 34a, ~125 lbs, 5'8"".) it's loose and flowy without being overly baggy. the tail of the shirt reaches just below my butt. if you're going to wear this with a pencil skirt or low rise jeans, the buttons on the side might get in the way a little. but that doesn'",5
"It is a beautiful dress, light and delicate. i got my usual xsmall ( 5'4"" 34c, 134 lbs). it comes with a slip and the slip is a bit fitted. it worked for me, but i can see this being an issue. it can easily be resolved with any other ivory or nude slip. it is worth it. very cute dress.",5
"I saw this online and thought it was so pretty--so i ordered a large even though i'm usually a medium in retailer shirts. i thought i might need the extra room to layer. i was in the store returning something and they had a medium and a large so i tried both and the large was way too big in my shoulders and chest even with a sweater! the medium was a little tight in my hips-but still
fit. overall the medium was more flattering on me. so i recommend ordering your regular size. it is such a pretty v",5
I've wanted a vest for the past few years and could never find the perfect one until now. the material is perfect and the colors are amazing. it's definitely a vest that you can wear all year. i would 100% recommend this.,5
"Beautifully made, well constructed and kangaroo pouch gives it character. turtleneck is very low, sweater is very appealing. great buy, especially when on sale.",5
"The fit on this dress is super flattering! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one. i am definitely a pear shape, bigger on the bottom than the top. one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top. this is not often the case. i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it. i also love the colors. i bought the green and blue. i have worn it once",5
"This is such a good dress to just throw on and go! the inside is lined with fleece so it's basically a giant sweatshirt. it does run large. i normally wear a medium and i bought the small but could have bought the xs if the difference in length between the two hadn't been about a foot. (i am tall). the color is actually a light mint, not the grayish blue it appears in the picture. overall a great purchase though.",5
"I was so excited to receive this dress! it even has embroidered loops on the hem of the slip underneath which was such a cute detail. it's very pretty on. that being said, i ordered a size 4 which fit me perfectly (150 lbs) but ladies, i do not mean this in any way but in my personal opinion, my arms are out of shape. not toned and flabby. the sleeves on this dress will not do you any justice. it will make your arms look worse because of the shape of the sleeve. so keep that in consideration if",5
"This dress makes you feel like a little kid. it certainly helps that it is an excellent twirling dress, for sure. i wish it had a little more definition to the waist--it just barely works for larger chested women, definitely on the line from being a little too baby doll shapeless. the colors are so beautiful and the fabric so light that it's hard to pass this one up. it's just too beautiful. i recommend it, but it's probably not for everyone.",5
"...on this great vest. i wear it all the time. it's soft, pretty, warm and durable. love!",5
"This is a gorgeous lace dress, well made, true to size. a little tight in the neck but not unbearable. lovely for any occasion. i got this to wear to a fancy wedding, it will be my go to dress for fancy occasions.",5
"I wasn't sure about the dress on the rack. lace can either look amazing or make you look like a doily. it was on sale so i figured why not? let's try it on. it is gorgeous on. true to size. i am usually a 0 and the 0 fits me perfectly. the quality and tailoring is amazing. it is a heavier dress with the lace and lining so it may not work on a super hot day. overall, i love the fit and quality of the dress. i love it even more on sale!",5
"This dress is absolute perfection. the quality of the dress is great, the fit is comfortable and it's such a fun summer dress. the slip underneath fits perfectly the outer layer is delicate yet durable.",5
"I saw this dress in the store in the coral color and tried it on. i am 5'4"", 34b, and slender to athletic build. i wear the size 2 in this dress. as far as sizes go for retailer, i would say it is tts. the slip fits like it should and the dress is flowing. it is not see through as were some of the other silk dresses this summer. it feels so comfortable and makes me feel pretty. it is a flowing dress and meant to fit that way. i waited for it to go on sale and the day it did i purchased it!!!",5
"This dress is really sweet and flows well. i love the fabric, and the colors are soft. this dress is perfect for hot summ days and is so comfortable. you could dress it up with fun sandals or simple wear flip flops. i love how the seam around the bodice drops lower in the back, it's very flattering. i bought a small.",5
"Unfortunately this top is shirt-length, and i'm only 5'4"". needs to be about 6"" longer. made of sweatshirt material, which i wouldn't mind if it were longer. also runs very wide- ordered an xs and could have gone smaller.",1
"I love everything about this vest! comfortable and cute, great transition piece into spring.",5
"I fell in love with the dress when i saw it but i was worried about a few things before ordering it. one comment mentioned that the slip underneath was tight in the hips, yet as a size 30 in pants the slip was still fine. the other concern was the length. i was worried that the dress would be very short compared to my height, however, it was a good length in the front and the back was came down longer than the front which helped the overall length. overall, i ordered a size 6 and it fit well in",5
"So much prettier in person. love it! i'm a size 2 in retailer and a small in this vest, even over a sweater still left quite a bit of room.",5
"Bought this because i don't have a puffer vest and living in san diego, i wanted a layering piece. it's much cuter on, but it does like much of retailer's clothes run a bit small. got tons of compliments on it when i wore it while shopping round town. very pricey but since the hood detaches and it's reversible, i guess it's worth it! (treat yo'self!)",5
Comfortable and true to size. it fits more fitted on the top and very swingy/flowy on the bottom. i got a petite and the length was perfect. if you like to wear very high heels you may want to go with a regular as its a tad short.,5
"First, this picture does not do this shirt justice. in fact, the hanger does not do this shirt justice. you must try this shirt on! it drapes so well. not as soft as some cloth & stone tops, but it is still very soft. the slightly stiffer feel makes it easier to dress up. there's no pockets, which is nice in a button down. it drapes in a very flattering way. i've never been happier with a cloth&stone garment. i normally wear a small in this brand, and that is true for this top as well. however,",5
"This dress is extremely feminine. the liner is the unsung hero here: it's cleverly designed to be fitted because on a windy day and the dress flies up, it's a saving grace; it has snap buttons and can be detached, the fabric is opaque so the dress is not see-through. the fabric of the dress is sheer, soft and smooth, and i thought it was silk until i read the tag which listed as viscose. the details of this dress is breathtaking, from the flower design (check out the bottom horizontal lines of t",5
"Purchased this today at my local retailer-been eyeing it a while-thinking i would wait until on sale-until the salesgirl whom i know said it was their second shipment and all have sold out. knew i needed to splurge. i tried on the small and x small and wound up going for the small. i did however try on 3 smalls and two of them were way to roomy, but the third one fit like a charm-it was quite a bit slimmer in body than the two smalls, strange but true. i do have room in it-i am a 32 c to 36 b and",5
I wasn't sure about this dress because some of retailer's cloths can make a women appear older before her time. i have to say that is not the case with this dress. i ordered it with the green and mint patterns in my normal size 2. this dress could not have been more beautiful on. i'm 5'6 115lbs and it fit perfect. the colors really compliment my dark hair and fair skin. i won't even need sunless tanner. i highly recommend this dress and placed the designer on my list to try out again.,5
"This dress is to die for. it's exactly as pictured, beautiful quality and extremely flattering. all the lace and lining make it a slightly heavier dress - i can imagine it getting really warm after a while in the summer sun. but it would absolutely be worth the bit of sweat to wear this gorgeous dress.",5
"This dress is horrible. i can't believe they can get away with calling it a ""dress"". it should have been called a tunic or shirt. it looks like it is a soft flowing dress made out of nice material from the pictures, no way. it is made from sweatshirt material it is lifeless and is kind of stiff. it came to the top of my thighs. i can't find one nice thing to say about this dress and i do not recommend it. the picture does it so much more justice that it is worth.",1
"I love this top. lovely, light, airy material, though i don't think i'll wear a cami under it. i'm usually a small petite so i ordered this in an extra small. i love the way it fits.",5
"I couldn't wait to get this top in the mail since they didn't have it at my local retailer, but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit. the white is completely see-thru, i can't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price. even as the shirt is lying down, i can see through both layers of it... the fit runs small, and short.",1
"This is even nicer in person than it is online. i absolutely love it. i am 5' 5"" and 128 lbs. and ordered my usual size small. i probably could have worn an extra small, but don't feel like the small is too big. this could be my favorite purchase of the season.",5
"For me this is the perfect blouse. alone or with a cardigan it's a winner. not too low cut, armholes are perfect. i would buy other colors if they were available.",5
"I bought this top in a size 6 - i'm 5'5"" with a longer torso. i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up. the material is on the thicker side so it's a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape. i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more. i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic",5
The quality of this jacket is outstanding. color combination is very chic and sophisticated. jacket is warm but not bulky.,5
"This casual top is adorable! a great top for jeans, linen pants or shorts! it would be cute with skirts too. 
i love the heavy feel of the fabric. too many fabrics today are thin and/or clingy. this is soft, but is substantial. it works well on my body-type. tall, thin, without much figure. it's not cheap, but something i'll likely keep for a few years.",5
"Great fit. colors look just like the pic. not too heavy but, warm and cozy.",5
"I actually rather like this top, i ordered a size smaller than usual, based on how flowy it looks in the picture, and was quite pleased. the pink color is rich, and i love the cut work... it has a bit of a sparkle in it, and is very pretty and flattering on the back. it does swing out a lot, but i ended up half tucking it. the pink color is very nice. it is gauze material, so of course, it is thin. i usually buy 0 but this 00 was great. also, there was no petite in the pink, so can't comment on",5
"I found this top in the roc center store and knew i had to have it! when my usual size 2 was unavailable, i sized down to a 0 because it looked plenty big and it fits fine. i bought the ivory color and love it! i plan on wearing it with pants as well as skirts. it's a lovely shade of ivory, quite flattering. boxy tops are often not for me, but this one is perfect!",5
I love this shirt. i bought it in both black and white and i get compliments every time i wear it. i totally recommend this top! it's a great material and easy to wear with a lot of different bottoms.,5
"Get this one during the 20% sale. if you dry clean it, you will have it forever!",5
The quality of this blouse is great. a bit on the thick side which i like. the fronts a bit shorter than the back. looks great with joggers or jeans. great neckline and design. i bought this in black and wore it with camo pants and sandals. love it!,5
"This top is very well made. nice heavy material for those in between days. the back is slightly longer than the front and it is well finished inside. i ordered a 00 which fits great in the body area, but a little tight on my arms. still a keeper!",5
"The picture does no justice to this stellar piece. its extremely comfortable and looks extremely chic!!! its very 1970's , studio 54 look and ive received tons of compliments!!!! at the price point, its worth it!!!!!",5
"I found this top to be quite flattering.........the slight give in the outer straps is necessary to allow for arm movement without issue.
i did not find it to diminish the aesthetic value.
i purchased it in white and loved it so much that i ordered the black also....not much of a pink person or i would have gotten that one too!
classic with a bit of a casual edge.
a must get!",5
Super simple top that's comfy. i like a looser fit and its boxy- both things i like. seems like it will be a staple piece.,5
"Love this top! it hits at the top of the waist & is very flattering. the fabric is thicker than i thought it would be and had a deep texture. when i first took it out of the package, i thought it would be a ""send-back"" because it looked kind of square & shapeless. but once on, it took on a whole other look.",5
"Saw this top on-line and thought i would give it a try. i am glad i did. there is not a thing wrong with this top. cute design, nice weight fabric,(no cami needed underneath) and it fits very well. for reference i am 5' 1"", 120lbs. and 35c. and of course it goes with literally every piece of clothing you would wear on the bottom half of your body!
this is a keeper.",5
"Love this top! with swing/loose tops, i always size down. i'm 5'1"", 115, 34b, and took a 0. it fit very well, i tried a 2 on as well and i could see what the other reviewers were saying about the top part not laying flat. so size down if you can! i got white so i use a nude bandeau bra with it, works well!",5
"This is a really unique and well made top. i saw it online and thought it would be boxy. but when i tried it on in my local retailer it fits perfectly and i love the shape. i bought the size small. i will say this is not a long shirt, skims just over the belt line so i will be careful when laundering. i will be getting a lot of wear out of this.",5
Goes with absolutely everything. it's very comfortable and versatile. can be dressed up or dressed down. great thing to have in the closet when you don't know what to wear!,5
"Absolutely loved this top but after i washed it the underside color ran at the stitching. it is all white on the outside but at the bottom hem it has a really cool 1"" lining in a mustard color. i did a cold water wash and flat to dry. i noticed around the stitching at the bottom the mustard color has bled through just at the area of the mustard color stitching. 

i am so disappointed b/c i loved this top.",1
"I held my breath as i slid this on for the first time right out of the package; the size 8 was perfect for me (usual medium, size 8, short-waisted, 34f)! this blouse is truly a find: luxurious linen in a unique, appealing design, excellent fit (the pleat at the back gives nice room to make the fit just right, the v-neck is not too deep (thankfully bra friendly!), the slightly lower back length is stylish but not extreme, and finally, admirable craftsmanship. i highly recommend! this will feel di",5
"This sweater is the kind of find i hope for when i browse the retailer website or walk into the store. i tried two sizes -- i sometimes wear an s and sometimes an xs these days -- and after trying them both i felt that with this sweater it was better to err on the side of snugness. the hooks and eyes pull a bit, but i won't be fastening this all the way to the top. the smaller size works better to hug my waist before the peplum flares out. the color is a dreamy pinky nude (more pink than nude), an",5
Love this poncho - plan to take it to europe this fall. warm and cozy yet not constricting. great neutral color!,5
"This skirt is great for the office, but also stylish enough to wear out to drinks/dinner afterwards. i think it fits a little big - i'm usually s and i ended up with an xs.

i think the tan is a little cuter than the gray in person, so i would recommend this one.",5
"Love this skirt because of the colors, the unique style, and for a knit skirt i'm very impressed that it maintains shape throughout the day. great skirt to own. received several compliments. had to size up from a 2 to a 4. 28"" waist and 36"" hips. the size 2fit snugly and not very appropriate for work, but great for a night out. the size 4 is still form fitting, flattering and work appropriate. very comfortable going up a size without compromising the form fit.",5
"This sweater is beautifully detailed, however, it seems too spring like to be for sale before christmas. very pretty. the cut may not be for everyone. it is like a peplum on the bottom and looks best open, as shown, on my busty top (36d) it seems cut slightly large but i am keeping my usual size medium. i'll keep for early spring! colors are as shown, detail better in person.",5
This is a beautiful sweater.,5
"This cardigan is not my usual color choice, but the details were so beautiful i had to buy it when i saw it at the store. the birds and flowers are detailed with sparkly little beads that are prettier in reality than you can see in these photos. it's also a versatile piece that can be worn in many ways and dressed up or down. i'm only 5'1"" but i didn't need the petite (which is good since it is sold out in petite). the sleeves are cropped so they don't hang too low for me. the sweater is hand wa",5
This is a great looking sweater. very nice quality and is a great design. can wear with many colors. love the look of this sweater and how it lays with the extra attachment on the bottom of it to make it kinda have a floating and airy look. nice!!!!.,5
This skirt is nicer in person. the fit is a little strange. the waist is tts but rest of the skirt runs a size large. i am a curvy size 8 and purchased the 6 based on another review. the waist is a tad snug but overall the skirt fits. it's too beautiful to return.,5
"I was uncertain about purchasing this dress. wow so glad that i did. i'm 5'5"" and 138lbs. i can wear a small or medium so i ordered both. the small was plenty big enough. wore it to a family event and received numerous compliments. so different from anything else and classy with the longer length. thanks for a great dress! i hope that it cleans well!",5
"I ordered this in the ""chocolate"" color which is really a pinkish/taupe-brown. but i love the color; it's neutral yet not too pale, just the right hue to go with almost any color and the style works with any outfit, from jean shorts to a dress. i love how soft the knit is. although i worry it might be prone to snag, especially the open-weave sections. i also love that the sleeves are full length, fitted enough to be pushed up on my forearms yet i can pull them down past my wrists when i am chill",5
"From the photos, i thought the design was embroidered. in reality, it is stamped on. there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins, but overall, the design is just printed on the fabric. i didn't feel it looked good, in fact it looked kind of cheap to me, so i returned it. the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual. i was disappointed it didn't work out.",1
This dress is so cute and comfortable. i'm normally a 0 or 2 and the xs is plenty roomy even though this is a clingy knit. the nice cotton under slip hides all the bumps and bulges. only worry is whether or not the loose weave will pick and how it will clean but so far i am thrilled.,5
"Unique and well-made skirt, sure to turn heads.  embroidery is lovely.  def a statement piece for any wardrobe.",5
This runs large. i usually wear a m so i ordered the m/l. reordering in next size down and hope that helps. i gave it 5 stars because the knit is beautiful and quality looked great.,5
Love this sweater. it can look dressy or just right with jeans! now if it will just cool down i can wear it!,5
"I am petite, 5'2"" - purchased the xsmall and it is a little big, but had to have this!! i would say runs a bit large. i think it will be a great addition to any wardrobe.",5
"While i wouldn't normally look at this piece, the price was unbeatable. i was even more impressed when it arrived and i tried it on! the design is reminiscent of an old time patchwork quilt fairy tale- more beautiful in person than in the pic. the covered buttons at the neck and wrists are just lovely and feminine, and the dress falls and flows around me in a fun and flirty way. i paired it with charcoal heather tights and dark gray booties- super cute! you won't regret it.",5
I wasn't sure if this dress would hang correctly on me and make me look shapeless but i'm so happy with it! the fabric is so comfortable and the tie in the back really helps draw it in so my waist is defined. the length is great and it's super comfortable but looks polished!,5
"This dress is beautiful and surprisingly flattering. i never would've picked this up for myself, but i'm so glad i did. it's also super comfortable.",5
I love paige jeans and these are no exception. the wash is so so great - a faded black/charcoal grey. it's like having two pairs of jeans in one! i am normally a 26 in most jeans and that's what i took in these. highly recommend!,5
"I am 5'8"" 140 lbs and the m fits perfectly. it is flowy and feminine but the tie in the back keeps it from looking boxy. pattern is really nice. great dress!",5
"This dress is amazing! it's perfect for a casual family or friend get together, or a fall dress with boots. the back ties to make it more flattering than just a shift dress. quality of the dress is great, and the material is very versatile.",5
I purchased these pants on 12/2/15 as a more fashionable alternative to yoga pants while traveling southeast asia starting february. after about 10-15 wears (with little washing in between as i was backpacker style traveling) the pants wore through in between my legs. the fabric first started to develop little fuzz balls everywhere and then literally disintegrated in places. i tried to sew them to continue wearing them while traveling but alas the fabric had become so thin that the thread could,1
These jeans look better in person - the pattern is more subtle than the picture online. these run true to size for ag denim.,5
"Hi, these are really nice. the material is thick. they will probably be warm in the heat. they are made of 100% polyester. if they were made out of linen they would be perfect.",5
"This dress is very pretty. i love it! people are not kidding about the buttons! i was prepared to reinforce them after it arrived. unfortunately, both buttons at the wrists were missing and they were not in the bag. it was on sale so i'm guessing they were lost before shipping. i love the dress enough to keep it. it will not be that big of a deal to replace them. besides the buttons, the dress is a very nice quality. it is lined and has a nice weight to it. i'm obsessed with rifle paper co. so i",5
"The fabric pattern is darling. i wore it in amsterdam and was told it looks like a traditional folk pattern. the dress is lightweight and is loose at the waist. sometimes i add a belt to cinch it in.

like another reviewer said, the buttons do pop off easily. i lost one at the cuff on the first day i wore the dress.",5
"I'm 5'2 & the length is fine except i'd probably hem if i used for yoga/pilates. but i prefer cropped for those activities, so these are just knock a round lounge pants for me. they are thin, but not in a cheap way. i don't understand why they're called french terry became that's not what i see/feel; but they are sumptuous & soft. i like that the fold over waist part is stitched & keeps its shape. for size reference, , i got the black xxs- i'm 115 lbs, athletic apple & they fit/look great & clin",5
Top is completely see through. i cant imagine if it were to get wet what it would look like. it is a cute design but not practical at all.,1
"I bought this on a whim because the colors were so me and fell in love with the bows and button back. i wore this over a lace peplum and opened up the bottom buttons of the button back for a fun layered look. true to size, as i was in my normal size small (5'5"", 135lbs, 34c). definitely check this out in person.",5
"I am a sucker for bows, so decided to try this one and ordered it. i went with the petite, without trying on the regular size (in hindsight, i should have ordered both), but tit fit very nicely in petite, so keeping it. length is as on the model, right at hip, the colros of hte bow are well represented on the picture, light pink, light mustard yellow and navy, so i stil lthink it is neutral ebough to mix with other colors: warm or cold palette. love hte button detial in the back, i ordered xs an",5
I tried this one on in the store and my typical xs fit perfect. it's not too boxy in the waist like every other sweater this season. also the mock neck is not to wide and is flattering. it sheds which i do not like but not as bad as some. the material is thin but warm i would layer it.,5
"I fell in love with the color and peplum design of this top online, and decided to order it. the fabric is soft, but strong, and the color is just as pictured. perfect for a casual shopping day or lunch date out with friends.",5
"I absolutely adore this shirt, it is such a comfortable material and goes great with a pair of jeans! i love how it fits tightly in the sleeves and flows out at the bottom just the right amount. i highly recommend adding this to your wardrobe.",5
"I pretty much love any sweater by moth. this one is no exception. soft, lofty, and a pretty shade (i bought in pink), this will be a cold weather staple.",5
"I love the fleetwood style...very trendy...fit like a dream - very long for you leggy gals. me, i need to hem (these would also look cute as cutoffs for us shorties)...true to size - slim fit!",5
"Super comfy cotton top, will be great for hot summer days when my shoulders have had enough sun!",5
"Agree with above review. these are described totally wrong. they are not 8.5 rise. they are very high rise, so much that i didnt even try them on...the color isnt good either, it looks like a cheap levi's color or just not a quality denim. if you like high rise, you might like them. i can't comment on fit..",1
I made the mistake of ordering without checking the reviews. cute design but not as comfy as it looks. returned immediately.,1
Great mock neck fits well and looks great with pants and skirts!! also love the dark grey color!!,5
Love this top! the length is perfect and it is very stylish! hope it will come in other colors because i would buy more!!,5
"5'7"", 135, 34c, 27-28 waist. love. a thin pullover (early fall weight) great for layering or on its on. darling with a skirt or jeans. buttons down the back for looks. bought the small. tts. fits like in the picture - hits at the hip. colors in photo are accurate. would be darling oversized too. it has just the right amount of fun without entering the stratosphere of crazy-cat-lady level. no bows on the back. i'd hand wash this one. if you still love bows, but don't want to be mistaken for being",5
This dress is so flattering and just beautiful in person. love it!,5
I'm an employee and bought this top today. i'm so happy i ended up buying it on a whim! it's adorable and super comfy! it's perfect for those jeans and a tee day! i can't wait to wear it to work. the color is gorgeous and the peplum adds a feminine detail without being too puffy...in love!,5
"I liked this as soon as i saw it. the cross stitch embroidery on the front adds a lot to the usual striped top. the fir is good, not too right or lose. i took a size medium, which was good for my 5' 140 lb frame. the 100% cotton was a plus for me, also. the thing i like the post about retailer is the uniqueness of the clothing. i don't feel like i see myself all over town.",5
I washed this on the delicate cycle and air dried - very happy to report that it washed very well and still looks new!,5
"It's soft and not itchy at all (itchy sweater is my all time nightmare). the design makes you feel like a snow princess. i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.",5
I can not speak highly enough about this shirt. i originally bought the navy one and then went back to purchase the other two colors. the material is soft and thin without being flimsy. the fit is very flattering.,5
"Versatile piece to finish out your look. love how it goes with so much of my wardrobe. simple, comfortable, and classic.",5
Love the cutouts and embroidered detail of this top. it swings away from the body due to the crisp cotton drape. perfect for summer!,5
"Soft, comfy and cute! great for casual wear! should've bought in more colors",5
"This dress is especially beautiful in person. the tulle doesn't snag and lays nice and flat, not point. this dress is easy to dress up or dress down, fits comfortably and has some stretch to it. the bodice does run a little high, higher than what is shown in the model picture, but lovely nonetheless.",5
I found this top at the beginning of the summer and waited until it was on sale to snag it but honestly wish i had gotten it sooner and paid full price. it's perfect with navy shorts or white jeans and can dress up or dress down. it's a little bit short on the bottom but definitely still flattering. i would recommend it to anybody looking for something to throw on for an easy outfit. definitely worth the sale price!,5
"I loved this dress. i am 5 ft tall and usually wear xs. this dress i would definitely need an xxs in. i like things not too tight, but this was too roomy so the style was lost. it was a little long, but i think that is because it kind of hung on me. the material is light but substantial. it has a lot of stretch to it, which is very nice. it has a silky feel - could be worn dressy or every day. a very good dress all around. waiting for the xxs to come in - i would definitely recommend it.",5
This dress is the perfect combination of beauty and comfort. the quality is excellent with a forgiving fit. it could be paired with black heels for a formal look or flats for a an easy date night. i just cannot say enough positive things about it!,5
"I love the color combination, and the bodice is very falttering. it has a tiny bit of stretch. the tulle is also feminine, i love that i could wear this with a moto jacket... sizing: no need for petite, it was short enough in regualr size. i think petite would have been too short (unless you are younger:-))",5
"I love this top--the fabric, the color, they way it hangs. i'm glad i tried it on in the store though because the v on the small went waaay too low, so i sized down to an xs and it was perfect. it basically fit the same as the small but with a higher v so my bra wouldn't show.",5
"This dress is very pretty, versatile and high quality! i'm planning to wear it to a wedding. with the holiday season coming up, i will definitely get to use it as well. the fabric is very comfortable especially the top part; it's very soft. i usually wear an xs petite, this dress seems to be a liiiiiittle too long for me and the waist is a tiny bit too loose from how i like it but it's manageable. (i have this dress in ivory top)",5
"Beautiful and different material, like it a lot. very happy with the purchase.",5
"I don't even know where to begin--this is a dress for all seasons, but especially the holiday season! i bought it specifically for the guise of a holiday part, i can't tell you what a (black) velvet blazer and (black) patent leather heels did for it! the amazing part is that i wore it to work with a cardigan and booties with no problem. my coworkers were amazed but its transition. i have a slim velvet belt with a antique-ish looking clasp that i wore all day with it, too, and that was the cherry",5
"I love these jeans, they have a great high waist thats tapered and supersexy, long legs and some stretch but not to much. the distressing is perfect and the wash nice and dark. i'll be wearing these alot.",5
This top has so many details. i love the material. it adds a little formal to the casual jean. i am waiting to wear this come fall weather with slim jeans and some boots. it gives me that old victorian vibe without being still and formal.,5
"I love this flirty, well fitted dress! quality material!",5
"Love it! i usually wear a small but i just went to our local store and they only had a medium. i tried it on just in case and it fit perfectly. it is sitting pretty in my closet now. :) so if you are a size small, try ordering a medium and i hope it works for you as well.",5
"Great little black dress for cooler evenings with boots, or dress down with a pair of flats for daytime. perfect fall dress!",5
Was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge. the material is not soft so it doesn't fall well. it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant!!,1
"I was apprehensive because of the long tail at the back of this shirt, but it is very pretty with capris.",5
This dress is perfection! very flattering and pretty.,5
"This dress is huge. i am normally a l-xl regular in retailer brands. i love a loose, flowy dress. after trying one on in the store (just a random returned petite xl) i ordered the petite medium. and it was still huge and not flattering. so sad. i wanted to love this- loved the material and colors, but way off.",1
"I bought this dress for my engagement photo shoot and rehearsal dinner and it's beautiful! it's delicate and feminine, without being too girly or frilly. very simplistic. and probably the comfiest piece of clothing i own! my only con is that i'm a little tall and it doesn't hit me completely on the waist, but it's still very flattering.",5
The yellow is not as bright as the pic and the tee shirt base color is more off white/oatmeal making the shirt look much more drab in person than in the pics. fit was ok but nothing special about this and will be returning.,1
"This skirt has a beautiful style, cut and pattern. i am so surprised it is on sale - what a great price. it has a medium sweater knit that is not clingy and has a slight flair. looks great with boots!",5
"Got this 4 days ago and have worn it 3 of those days. it is a perfect, beautiful autumn dress. the fabric is textured and slightly color-varied in a way that gives the black a more charcoal depth. the fabric is a thin sweater knit -- because of the texture it looks thicker than it is and i had hoped it would be thicker but i actually think if it were thicker it would not have the movement it does, nor would it be as figure-flattering. despite its thinness, it is still warm. would buy this in oth",5
Super cute and more fitted than the baggy overalls of yesteryear. i love them.,5
"I didn't buy it for the longest time based on the other reviews but i finally did and i love it. great color, great quality, great fit. oh and great price too! i say - go for it.",5
Love this blazer. you can wear it with anything. fits well and lightweight. perfect for south florida.,5
"I know it's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock, or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on! the fabric is incredible. so luxurious. it fits me amazingly. i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing, as i'm fairly skinny, but still curvy, and while i love my curves, i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you're trying to look sexy. this, however, is a godsend.",5
I ordered this in blue and the color is absolutely gorgeous! i really loved it until i put it on. wow it was bad. i ordered a small--normally a sm/med due to bust but this was so wide and had so much material. it wasn't long but rather incredibly boxy. one of the most unflattering things i've ever tried at retailer.,1
I am pleased with this skirt. the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips. i ordered a 2 which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse. i am 5/5 and 119. it works well for work and leisure.,5
"I bought these in my usual size 28 and they were much too loose so i returned them. i definitely need a 27 (39 inch hips, 33 low waist, 31 waist). i have lost a few pounds but i am usually a size 4-6 in pants. even loose i can see the pants are flattering and long enough for my leggy 5' 9"" frame. they are still cropped but i would say look much the same as on the model. if you are shorter, i think the petite option would be necessary to achieve a cropped look. the material is not bright white wi",5
"Love this top, dramatic in a casual way.
i ordered the teal and love love love it....with skinny jeans or leggings the style is perfect !
i am over 50, so the teal is gorgeous and i think very age appropriate.
i ordered the blue also, a very pretty shade of blue.........but felt in this style, the bright/light colors would be more appropriate for someone younger.
it's a stunning top...........and fits very true to size..........the drama of the ruffle is what sets it apart..
hoping they do",5
Great denim color and fit. gives a nice feel to the waist.,5
Women who want some flutter without too much fullness,5
"I love this tee but it isn't for everyone. i am usually a solid medium & i tried on both xs/s. i went w the small bc i liked the volume.  for reference, i'm 5'6"" and wear a medium/size 8-10. 

not thinking this is for small petite women as the peplum hem is poplin, not tee knit material so it holds its shape. on my frame it was so cute. got the holly color.",5
"I purchased this top at my local store this past weekend, and i have to say i already know it will become an easy, go-to top. it does run large, so consider that when choosing what size to order. i generally wear a medium, but purchased a small in this top.",5
"I had such high hopes for this top! the colors! the peplum! the ruffles! the price point! the fit was terrible, unflattering, and laughable! please try again with this one, retailer. you could have a real winner with a little tweaking!",1
"These pants are simply darling! i purchased them with my birthday discount (thank you, retailer!) and even without a discount i think they are worth every penny. flattering, and the most important feature of any pant, makes my butt look good. don't hesitate, buy these today before they are out of stock. 

the fit is true to size and the material is of excellent quality.",5
It fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me.,1
"I think i wanted a skirt like this in the 1980s. with its aged denim and retro style, it looks like i've had it all that time. i couldn't zip my usual 4 but the 6 is comfortable if a bit snug, sitting right at my natural waist. it's flattering and shows off my waist with tops tucked in, something i never do with my other skirts, which all sit lower. i like how it flares a little oddly due to the horizontal seam. it's interesting and different. i will wear it in summer with sandals and it will lo",5
"I followed everyone's advice in the reviews and ordered up one size. i have a 32 inch waist, but size 10's (and 30's in pilcro hyphens) usually fit me. i ordered the 12 in this skirt, and it fits perfect. it's form fitting at waist and hips and then flares out, but i'm curvy. if you are straighter, it will be looser around the hips. i love the length. it hits me mid calf, so a bit lower than it does on the model. i'm 5'5"" tall. the fabric is soft, but has no stretch. it's 100% cotton. there is a",5
"While this top does fit very loose, it is very cute and can be relaxed or you can dress it up. it is shorter in the front and longer in the back which makes the shirt take on a flattering look. i bought the green color and it is a very rich color, it will be perfect for fall! you may consider ordering a size down if your regular size tends to fit loose.",5
"I adore this top. it is super soft, drapes nicely, and looks great with a ton of different bottoms. i am 5'4"", 104 lbs., and ordered this in both xs (my usual size), and s. i ended up keeping the s (most cloth & stone xs tops swim on me, so i was a little surprised), but glad i tried both. my only concern is how it will hold up after washing it. it is a gauze-like material, and i just hope i can get a long life out if this top.",5
"I had my eye on this skirt online but it sold it out in my size 2 so i ordered a 0 and crossed my fingers. before it arrived, i happened across a size 2 at my retailer store that someone had returned. it fit perfectly. i am 5'6"" and my waist is 25/26. it is high waisted but i thought that added to the fit and made it stand out from the usual black skirt. it fit my waist and hips./butt fine. it is quality material and has a structured fit and great length. it is unique and classic. i can see this b",5
"I saw this blouse and had to have it. i ordered my usual size large and was shocked at how big it was. it looked like a maternity top on me, so i sized down to medium. it fit much better and i was able to fully appreciate how gorgeous the colors were and how feminine and pretty the mock neck was. i definitely recommend it, but suggest to size down for a better fit.",5
"This top is well made and fits me like a glove. i am only 5'1"" but have a very muscular build. the xs fits perfectly--slimming around the torso but roomy enough in the shoulders and arms. the fabric is a nice upgrade from typical flannel.",5
This top looks even better in person! the fit is very flattering and the fabric is comfortable. i highly recommend it!,5
"I was hesitant to buy this dress due to there not being any reviews, but decided to take a chance and order it. it is fabulous!!! great fit, off the shoulder design stays in place, and the dress hits the smallest part of my waist perfectly. the lace detail on the hem and the tassels on the ties are details that sets this dress apart. i wish that it was made in another color, perhaps a solid. you all hit this one out of the park, retailer!!!",5
I love this blouse with a pair of jeans. the neckline is fairly deep but very flattering and feminine. the detail is beautiful.,5
"I love this skirt, wanted to order it from the moment it was new and took em a while to decide to do so (when i saw it was almost sold out in my size, which it is now). another thing is it doesn't come in petite - boohoo.
anyway, ordered the 0 (smallest size) for my 26.5 in waist - didn't have any trouble with the waist being too tight, like some other reviewers. it fit really well and comfortably. sits at the natural waist, so the hem isn't too crazy low on me. fine for heels (would be so cute",5
It fits great! i love the material and how it fits and drapes.,5
This shirt runs gigantic and it's not even cute. i.'m done buying retailer online.,1
"I got the small petite and this fits beautifully, as on the model (i am 5'2""). i do think that it flatters a flat belly more than it would flatter a fatter one! it would certainly hide any belly, but the drape works best if you're streamlined, i imagine. if you've got a tapering torso, go for it! depending on your bust, you may want to pin the overlapped fabric just to be sure of hiding the bottom of your bra. not that i've found it a problem.",5
I ordered this in size xl and it is a perfect top. the draping is very flattering to my shape. the material is soft and the flowers/colors are appropriate for work. it's the perfect length too. i love everything about the cut of this top. the pattern will vary on each since the flowers are staggered. i love the knot effect along the waist. great purchase. hope this style will continue to be used for other tops in other patterns/colors for spring/summer timeframe. these are a little too dark/heav,5
"I love the feel of this shirt. from a distance it looks like flannel but close up it appears more like muslin. i find the fabric very soft and the colors are fab--more vivid than the photo. the buttons do not go all the way up the shirt. for me the top button is right at the top of my cleavage so i can wear it alone or with a cami or other scoop neck. if you want a more refined flannel look/feel, this is it. i find it tts. if you're in between sizes, i would order down.",5
"This dress is very pretty in person, and perfect for warm and hot weather. the material is comfy and breathable, and the length is perfect. for reference, i usually wear a medium in retailer dresses, and ordered this in a medium as well. at that size, it does not bunch up around the waist as much as it would if i had ordered a large, but then the fit would have been baggier elsewhere on my body. i am fine with it being a closer fit across my waist, so i would say it fits true to size for me, but w",5
"I love this shirt for its subdued colors and casual style. it is lighter in weight than a flannel shirt but retains a feeling of softness. it is from cloth and stone, a brand i like. usually i buy that brand in a small because their shirts run large for me. i liked this shirt so much i ordered it twice and waited for a backorder. i sent the small size back and was lucky enough to get a medium before the next out of stock situation.",5
I love the fit and feel of this shirt. the fit is narrow but true to size. the stitching details are beautiful and make this shirt really versatile.,5
"This blouse is adorable! very flattering wrap design, especially on my small chested body. also, the black and white is very appealing. can't wait for warmer weather so i can wear it!",5
"This dress is so beautiful in person. it is not overly flowy, well made and extremely feminine. i really have not a bad word to say about it. and on sale, it's a steal. i plan to wear mine with tall boots as shown and with my cowboy boots.",5
"I love this skirt! i know others have thought it frumpy, maybe it's because i'm so long waisted but this skirt is perfect for me! not too long not too short but just right! the fabric print is beautiful a mix of muted and bright colors. the fabric quality is nice but nothing overly outstanding. still i'm glad i ordered it before it was gone!",5
"Ugh, the fit of this dress is terrible :/ what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential. but, the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok, if not a tad big, but hip down was crazy tight that i couldn't even zip it without a ton of effort. i don't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger. disappointing.",1
"For some reason they are not replenishing this shirt even though it sells out like wildfire. 
i got a small even though i was pretty sure i needed an extra small. this shirt is pretty wide, not prohibitively wide but not a fitted shirt by any means. i'd love to get this in my size if they ever opt to sell more in the ivory.",5
"This shirt is absolutely beautiful! the front is very thin and delicate, but wearing a nude bra underneath, you can't see a thing. i did need to add a snap between the top two buttons to avoid the chest ""gap"" but the back of the shirt offers enough stretch that it doesn't appear to ""pull"" at all. it's hard to find a button down that fits nicely when your short waisted and large chested. this one is it!!!!",5
"At last, in a world of loose, billowy silhouettes, a draped top that falls a little closer to the body! the fabric is of good weight and has the right amount of stretch.

i also love the retro/vintage pattern of the fabric itself. the fit is feminine and comfortable.

you will have to wear a camisole with this top, but i do not consider that a negative. it is the way of the deep v neck.",5
"I am glad to add this very versitile top to my wardrobe. it can be worn with a sweater in the cooler months (like i wore it today), a business jacket, or alone in the summer. i wore it with a fit-and-flare skirt today, but it goes with pants, jeans, shorts, etc.
fyi: i am a 36 c(34d), short waist, broad shoulders/back, size m in knit tops, 10/12 in fitted or ones with buttons. i purchased my normal size m in this top.

"I have featured photos below. i'm 5 feet and 120 lbs and 34 d. i purchased a small petite. the fabric is cotton, i thought it would be rayon. it is lined with cotton fabric. the skirt has major poof. it falls like a midi on a petite. the waist runs high, which can not be a  good thing for a busty gal. why do i love it? the pattern is one of a kind. the colors are so fall. i wore a vest to accomplish a tapered look. i can't resist this skirt. if your tall, this is a dream. if your petite, you can",5
"Absolutely love this dress. it is perfect for the summer. yes it wrinkles but that does not take away from how cute the dress is. the style is so unique, love the pleats. i am 146lbs, 5'6"" 36dd and the size 8 fits perfectly. not tight through the arms holes or the bust area. the dress hangs perfectly, you can dress it up or where it to run errands.",5
"Very cute dress for special occasions or even work. dress is comfortable, excellent quality but does run slightly large.",5
Nice and colorful dress but runs very oversized. material mutes the colors not as vibrant in person.,1
I ordered  flora nikrooz for my daughter for her wedding.  it is beautiful. the delivery was quick!!! very happy.,5
"True to size, very pretty.  as pictured expect that it is more peachy and not this light.  i like it and will keep it but just be aware that it is not a pale pink as in the picture.",5
Beautiful design and fit.,5
I bought this when it first came back a number of years ago and loved it because it is great for travel! it actually can be kind of a blanket when you are on airplanes that tend to be cold and it is so hard now to get a blanket. it is also great coat for me as i live in southern california and it is not too heavy but does help the evening chill. i went on a trip with this a few months after i originally bought it and i accidentally lef at the hotel i was staying at. i am so glad it is back so th,5

"These are very nice pants. good quality and as expected. however, they do run small. i generally wear a small or size 4, sometimes a 2 depending on the maker. on average a 4. these i measured were 0 to 2 sizing. sending back and going a size up.",5
"Here's the thing: i ride horses. you would think this would mean i would love this, but the first time it came around, i hesitated simply because i spent too much of my childhood in horse-bedecked things looked overwhelmingly nerdy. but this time, having actually purchased the belted navy birds version, i had to give it a try, and it's kind of a must. there is just something about the way it falls that is super flattering. it's just warm enough to serve as a jacket right now (in new england) but",5
"This is every bit as lovely as shown! the shade of blue is delightful with the pintucks, lace embellishment's and covered buttons. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) my normal size. i can see where it could be a problem for bustier women because the pin tucks tightened the upper chest area and it is fitted in the shoulder area. going up a size may help some but if your smaller like me it is tts. i think it's a wonderful rendition of a denim top. this would work in any season of the year.",5
"I bought this coat 5 years ago and every fall/winter, i can't wait to wear it again. can't even begin to describe how many people comment on how beautiful and unique it is! it has worn well over the years considering how much it has been worn, but i just might be tempted to buy it again (which is something i have never done with a statement piece). the only design feature i would change is that it has no closure. i actually had a beautiful large antique button that i sewed on with a snap and it",5
"This jacket is so cute and fits perfect and i love the motif. however, it deposited black linty particle all over my pants and top and the fabric was already pilling just from being on the hanger in the store. this piece will look bad/worn/old in a very short period of time. it's a big shame, because it's so perfect in every other way. i choose not to buy it. it's very expensive for the quality.",1

"This sweater sold out fast at my local retailer store. you know that stuffed animal that you owned when you were a kid, and you would never let it go because it was so soft and snuggly? yeah, it is like that for me. it's a bit pilly but that's what sweaters do. size petite s fit me perfectly (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), hem falls 4 inches above my knees, sleeves fall right at my wrist, and it gives room for wearing a sweater or turtleneck under it. hood lays flat, horse print is so cute.",5
"I saw this in the store and wanted to try it but couldn't justify buying *another* denim shirt at this price. then it went on sale! as others said, this does run a bit small though the chest/shoulders, so i sized up one size. it's still slightly fitted, but my broad shoulders are used to that. i was afraid that the pleats would give a maternity look (although my chest size is not that large 36b)-- it doesn't do that on me. it's loose but not overly so--kinda like the current swing top trend! the",5

"I love these pants. they are beautifully made and appear to be very comfortable. now if i could just get them buttoned! i am a size 8/medium. i bought the large after reading other reviews. i'm not joking when i say i can't button them. i am in such love with them (and still hoping to lose some baby weight), that i am going to keep them in hopes to wear them!",5
For those who are wondering this sweater coat is 50% lambswool and 50% acrylic. the original version of this coat was 100% lambswool. 50% acrylic yet the price remained the same???i would have payed more money to have this sweater coat made in 100% lambswool like the original version. this is another example of declining quality and a high price tag for synthetic materials.,1

the colors are even nicer in person; the neutral yellow is sure to compliment a lot.
you would be disappointed with this purchase.",5
Love these jeans! runs true to size and has a bit of stretch. can uncuff them and have a longer straight jean. very versatile.,5

"Wonderfully soft fabric and gorgeous pattern. the background color is a more standard gray than shows in the on-line photo (which looks more pinkish gray on my screen), but it's just lovely -- looks perfect with jeans or a skirt. i will be wearing this a lot this fall, and will keep a lookout for additional patterns!",5
"Love this top! the colors are so fun and happy, and the fabric/fit are soft and breezy. it is definitely on the boxy side, but not in an unflattering way (in my opinion). super cute in my usual size small.",5

however, very nice jean once again from pilcro.",5
"Nice thick fabric, lays well. sleeves three quarter but looks great on.",5
"Great tee! the color online is lighter and nicer in my opinion than in reality. it's much darker in real life, but otherwise it's a super soft tee with gently fluttered sleeves and side slits. i bought it in a s and it's roomy without being oversized. great for fall....",5

"I thought i'd be the first to review for non -size- small ladies... i'm usually between a large and xl in retailer.  the large was great.. with room , as this top is pictured.  you'll love the details on this colorful, fun top ( ex: buttons on the side).  great with skinnies. i bought it on sale, but it really is a special top and worth the price.",5
"These are so much better than i anticipated! they are lightweight for summer, the perfect length (i'm 5'7"" and they are just right with a 2"" wedge), and very flattering. i will be living in these all summer long! i agree with the other reviewer who felt the catalog picture misrepresented them. they do not have a technicolor sheen at all. rather, they are a beautiful, classic chambray.",5
"Nice quality, details, and i like the looser cut (works well on this blouse).",5
"T.la makes the best tees. soft feel, sophisticated color layering, and a body skimming shape -- all retained after multiple washings. versatile, too. other tees fade, stretch out, shrink. not t.la. a gem.",5
"This is a great little top. a wonderful basic, but the crochet/lace detail adds the perfect amount of uniqueness. it's a soft jersey material that doesn't cling. falls very nicely over the body, flow-y without being too flow-y. i ordered my usual small, and it fits tts. for reference i'm 5'1, 125 lbs, and 34d bust. i did not order the petite since i have a longer torso, very happy i orderer a regular small. will be a great spring and summer top.",5
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d)-32-40 and the size l fit me perfectly. i probably could have gotten into the m, but i don't like my t's to pull under the armpits or across the bust, and this top looks like it needs room to flow.

2. the white is very sheer, but a nude bra won't show through. the navy is not see through.

3. i love the asymmetric hem in the back.

4. i'm a little concerned that the raw edge on the hem won't hold up in the wash, but i plan on hand washing these anyway, bec",5
"I bought this shirt yesterday for 30% off the sale price. i usually wear a m. the store only had s and i didn't want to pay for shipping, so i bought the smaller size. it was loose through the body, tight in the arms. you could size down if you need to. but if you have large arms, i would get your normal size or get one larger. the arm fabric does not have much give. the shirt dips low in the front and back, so it has ample coverage for your mid section. it also would accommodate just about any",5
"Fun top, 5'4, 135 lbs and i ordered xs. it was too wide and boxy so exchanged for xxs and it fits great. i like the fun slant to the side. not tight on stomach which is great! :) great top.",5
"Based on the first person's review, i ordered a l at first... then i got it and it kinda fit like a maternity shirt and looked a bit too baggy/sloppy, not as flattering as the picture. i tried using the measurement guide below, based on the bust measurement, and i'm at the low end of the m size, so i ended up ordering the m and s just in case. the s size fit like the picture. i'm glad this isn't slim in the waist and fitted nicely in the shoulders. the blue color is beautiful. if you are more of",5
"Lovely top, flattering and dressy, would definitely get another color if they have it.",5
"Got this in the white and it fits perfectly. just the right length and enough detail on the shoulders. i'm 5'6"" and 120 (usually an xxs or xs for tops) and the xs fits just right, not too loose not too tight. i like the style since it emphasizes my shoulders and balances nicely with cropped jeans (i'm pear shaped). material is slightly clingy but it adds to the drape nicely (wouldn't work well if it was fitted, but it's not).",5
"I wasn't sure about this shirt at first glance, it's difficult to see in the picture but the top of the shirt and the peplum are two completely different fabrics, with the top having a much looser weave. however, it looks great on. the blue color is very saturated and pretty. the fit in the shoulders and arms is stretchy and comfortable. and it hangs in a really flattering and comfy way on my hourglass frame. i'm pretty busty, 36dd i think....i usually have to wear l in retailer tops unless they'r",5
"This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews, but it was way too big. sadly, i had to return it.",1
"I know i'm going to get a lot of wear out of this t-shirt this summer. i have it in white, and it's not too see through, which is what i always worry about when i wear white shirts. it's basic but then it has lace on the shoulders that adds something extra. i love its drape--it's not too form fitting. on me (i'm 5'2), it tends to be a bit long, but i like it. the shirt being cotton means that it's super soft. as far as washing goes, best practice is to machine wash and hang to dry--i'm afraid of",5
"Once or twice a year, retailer dons out a true 80s masterpiece!  the sweater is sturdy, bright and bold. quality and craftsmanship are amazing and the fit is tts!  i cannot wait for the cooler weather to wear this beauty with some skinny jeans!!",5
Tried this on in the store and fell in love. it's such a simple shirt but the details are special. runs tts. will get a lot of use out of this.,5
"Spotted this in the local store last week & just had to try it on! it is a soft cotton gauze texture which is slightly stiff but in a good way. my usual size small was too big. the oversized look was fine from front & back view, but in the side view the bottom stuck way out. the xs was much better so i took it home. its very comfy & looks great with dark blue denim. 5'3"", 118#.",5
"I?m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors. somehow, this top was love at first sight. it looks simple but it?s not. it?s unique in its own way (look at the back, the slightly puffy sleeves, the side slit), and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything. the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot, so cute. i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online (i?m 5?2?, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i know the price seems",5
"This pretty tee looks wonderful on! the cut and drape really flatter a woman's shape and will be versatile for pairing with casual or work outfits. i love the soft feeling, although it is not cotton as posted online.; the tag inside the shirt says: 95% rayon, 5% spandex. it doesn't really matter, but it's not what i expected. the rayon/spandex is very soft to the touch, has a beautiful texture to it and certainly feels comfortable. i really love the lower back hem at the hips, so flattering! i d",5
Great shirt that is basic with a little something extra. meadow rue does it again...i swear i buy everything they put out...,5
"I purchased this jacket on pure impulse. to be quite honest it reminds me of a coat my dad used to wear, and i was halfway on the way to retailer when i decided to try it on. my goodness it's perfect. it's slightly oversized, delightfully 70's and makes everything look good skirts, pants, dresses etc. buy it, especially off the 70's have a special place in your heart.",5
"This tee is my favorite this year! it just looks great on! not fitted, but not loose either. i love it so much i have it in white, black, pink, light green, gray, slate blue and holly. the holly was my least favorite color (i thought it would look a little 'greener') it is so dark, you almost have to see it in the sunlight to be sure it is green. i ordered it online from the store and i kept it just because...

i love the fact that it can be machine warned and dried without shrinking. i don't dr",5
"I knew when i bought this bralette that there was something special about it...the intricacy of the design is really pretty as is the style...but seriously - every single time i wear this bralette out (paired with a cute top or dress) i get tons of compliments from all of my friends. i never thought a bralette would spark so much conversation! aside from that it is super durable...i've had it for a year now, have washed it several times, and it is not stretched out at all or frayed aka it is gre",5
Perfect crop jeans with just a tiny flare. i'm a size 8 and the 29s fit perfectly.,5
"The fabric is thin, though. you better wash it in a bag or the washing machine will tear it up!",5
"I'm very pleased with this jacket! i've never owned a ""vegan"" leather anything, so i didn't know if it would show up cheap looking or smelly.. but to my surprise, it didn't have a ""smell"" or that shiny cheap look. i'm so glad i headed the other reviewers advise and i sized up, my typical size would have been to tight and short! i'm excited to wear this with dresses and jeans this fall! i bought the ""honey"" color and it's more like a cross between beige and blush(a slight dusty pink hue)! i love",5
"Absolutely stunning design with the eyelet lace top!  it's a very romantic, comfortable top that has a flattering fit. i'm so glad that it has lining so i don't need to be concerned about exposing myself to anyone.  it has a light fabric so it's very comfortable in the summer heat and humidity in florida.",5
"I've been looking for a leather/faux leather jacket for ages, and this one is perfect! it's just a tiny bit edgy, but more feminine than most leather jackets, which is exactly what i was looking for. i typically wear xs, but after reading the reviews for this jacket that said it runs small, i ordered both a small and xs to try on. the small was way too big, and the xs fit perfectly - it can be worn over a light layer or over a chunky sweater very comfortably, without the arms getting tight. i th",5
"So happy with this jacket! i have looked for what feels like forever for a vegan leather jacket that is (1) long enough in the sleeves and (2) wide enough in the shoulders without being bulky through the body. i found it ran true to size. my usual large for well, xl was a little big. the material is beautiful and soft and the colors are great. i ordered the honey and cognac and love them both.",5
"This is a stunning dress. fits true to size, very high quality, has a very flattering shape, and the lace embroidery is gorgeous.",5
"These are adorable and very very comfortable. i'm loving the flattering mid rise.
as stated before there is no flare as depicted in the photo but still super cute!
nice with flats, easy to dress up with some sexy heels.",5
"I am 5'4, 34b, 106lbs and the 0 fit me perfectly. it comes just above my knee so i could also have worn the petite and would have been fine if it was shorter too. i rarely wear green but this shade is so pretty.",5
"I love this dress! i am 5'3"" 117 lbs and ordered the size 0. the fit is excellent and is very flattering. the color is more kelly green than what is shown in the picture, and is lovely. i wore it to my 40th celebration and adored wearing the dress!",5
"A friend of mine has several of these jackets and i always asked ""where did you find that from?"" the answer? retailer vegan leather jackets! i bought 2 when they were on sale and i love both (grey and dark brown/purple). they are super comfy and surprisingly warm. can dress up or dress down for any occasion. i can't wait to buy more!",5
The material that was used to make this top is very thin and poor quality. it feels like the type of material that will disintegrate after one wash. i normally wear an xl and this top is huge and not flattering. returning asap.,1
"I've been looking for a leather or faux leather jacket for years and years and this is the first one that i've ever loved so much! the style is edgy and modern, yet still feminine and flattering. love the cut of the jacket, so flattering! looks amazing with dresses, skirts or denim. i got the dark red color, and it's much more brown and neutral than it appears online. i would love to get the tan color as well, but it's currently sold out in my size. the faux leather looks believable and expensiv",5
Just received this dress in the mail. it's stunning!! the lace is just beautiful. i ordered two sizes and had to size down a bit - the fit is generous. can't wait to wear this to my rehearsal dinner next week.,5
"I bought this at the store today and it's the perfect summer top! i'm not going to pull it off my shoulders, so it's a little shorter than shown here. but it goes great with capris and skinny jeans and i plan to take it with me to italy. it will go with so many things! very well made, thickish material.",5
I got the jacket in the gray. it's a pretty pretty shade of gray. it's soft and feels really good on. it's short. like hits at the waist. i have long arms and the small for perfect which i was very pleased.,5
"I'd been looking for a replacement for my faux leather jacket and this has surpassed my expectations. well-made, lovely color, very soft, flattering cut. it runs small so i sized up from my usual petite xs to a petite s. it's warm and the lining is very pretty. hopefully it'll hold up to daily wear. i'd definitely recommend it as a great jacket to take you from fall - spring. i got the plum color.",5
I tried this on today and loved it. it is so well made and stays down off the shoulders without any struggle. it is lined in the front and the back is billowy and gorgeous. a timeless and well made piece.,5
"I have a hard time with jackets fitting because i have chubby arms compared to the rest of me. i like the way this fits and it doesn't pull when i try to cross my arms in front. i feel like it's good quality and hopefully won't flake the way 'vegan' (i.e. fake) leather can. and i think i can throw it over a top with jeans or a dress and it will be cute and versatile. i also like the length that hits right at my hip. i'm 5'2"" and don't like when jackets like this are are too long.",5
Love this jacket!got my usual size medium and is perfect! beautiful quality,5
"I have many moulinette soeurs creations. all are true to my size, breathtakingly beautiful, unique, made well. i ordered this dress, and i am very excited about receiving it soon. the front neckline is round, and it becomes a v in the back.",5
"Bought this for my daughter who is graduating this year. looks much better in person then it does in the photo. she is 5'7"" and 135lb. we bought the size four. great length on her. green adds a nice pop of color. she loves it.",5
These shirts are perfect for a casual day. basically t.la shirts are my daily go to. i usually wear a small but i buy these in medium because i like the looser fit. a little pricey so after buying 1 at full price i waited until they were on sale to buy more.,5
"Love this top! not too low cut, drapes nicely and the material is thin enough but not so thin you have to wear a tank top. it does seem to run on the larger side.",5
I agree the pictures are confusing. the front top of the dress is not cut out as some pictures seem to indicate. this is such a great dress! it has a great lining underneath and is really flattering and nicer/dressier looking in person than i imagined it would be. i think it fits true to size. i either wear a 4 or a 6 in most retailer dresses and the 4 in this dress fits me well. i'm planning to wear this dress to my bridesmaids luncheon! i definitely recommend!,5
"The catalog shot and model shot are completely different. it's like not even the same dress. the neckline, color, the quality of lace",1
"I am consistently a size 27 in pilcro jeans and these are no exception. these are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am 5'3"" but i still love them. i found them to be true to size. because they don't have much stretch, they are a little snug in the thigh at first but the denim gives a bit throughout the day. the shorter length with the little flare is so versatile - they look great with a dressy top and heels and just as good with a cozy sweater and flat chelsea boots. love pilcro!!!",5
"Love this so much because it's so soft, pliable and fits wonderfully with all of my fall wardrobe.  i ordered the plum color, which looks brown to me.  was advised to size up and glad i did.  i bought large petite and my stats are 5'3"" 135# 38/28/35.",5
"I have no where to wear this pretty spring time inspired dress.  fits just as pictured, except that i'm short.  i ordered the 10p so my 36dd chest and wide rib cage fit comfortably.  i'm saving this dress for easter or a fancy bridal shower.",5
Love this jacket! it is incredibly soft and expensive looking. i love the details with the zippers on the sleeves and very cute lining inside the jacket which is not pictured. i ordered my usual size xxsp and it fit great. this brand does run small so if you are between sizes or prefer a looser fit you should order a size up.,5
"I saw these in the sale section on line and just loved their look. they fit great and have a cute little flare at the bottom. i like the reinforced inside seams which means they will last longer. i've been wearing them with my shorter boots and booties this winter. i have slim legs and they aren't too tight and not too loose. my inseam is a 33 so they may be a tad short on me, but i love them.",5
I love this bralette. i have it in other colors as well and it is always the one i go to when i want comfort.,5
"I admittedly watched this dress until it went on sale, then was lucky enough to find it! i couldn't find my normal size (8p), so thought i would take a chance with the 10p and it fit perfectly! i haven't tried on the 8p, but i'm guessing it would have been a bit snug. the dress is comfortable and feminine, and i absolutely love it. i know i will wear it all summer!",5
"I love this jacket. i have not worn it yet, as the weather is still very warm, but i am looking forward to wearing this a lot this fall. the cropped cut is very flattering and the vegan leather very soft, i followed the other reviews and ordered one size up and it;s perfect. i am normally a size 4 and went with he medium. the plum color is quite neutral in person. i also love the printed lining. i did notice quite a few long threads around the lining sewing, i hope this is just an overlooked pos",5
"There is some confusion in the first few reviews over the image, but the dress has a medium green lace and does not have a cut out at the front of the neck. it runs more true to size than some dresses at antrho -- my size is a small 6 petite (meaning that i often end up in a 4) and the six is perfect. 

the dress hangs gorgeously and fits fabulously. the zipper is a bit hard to get through the seams and lace, but worth it.

it has a formal feel, but i think it can be made casual with shoes a",5
"I originally ordered the white in this cami, but after receiving was absolutely obsessed with it! i ordered the 2 other colors. the fabric is so soft and the buttons are perfect as i just had a baby and will need easy access for nursing. love this cami!",5
I recently purchased this blouse on their 40% off sale in white. i was hoping for a crisp white structured blouse. i did read all the reviews and thought i would give it a try anyway. it is awful. there is no structure or shape but the quality is the reason i am returning. it feels like a napkin or thinner. not even worth the extra sale price. i will be returning.,1
"This was a last minute addition to my online order to hit the free shipping! anyway... this ended up being my favorite item from my order! i love the way it wraps and also lays open. i didn't realize that the fabric was a mix of two different knits, but i think it adds nice interest. i ordered the red,which is a nice, deep red...not an obnoxious fire engine red. it's very complimentary to my skin tone and dark hair. i run between a small and medium, but chose the medium since it looked like it c",5
"This jacket is very well made. the denim is quality and very soft. the other fabric isn't as heavy as the denim, but not so much that it feels like a mismatch when wearing it. i was surprised to find slash pockets by the side seams. on the interior, the slash pockets are sewn down and deep so that you can use them as pockets too. handy for your phone. fits true to size maybe a tiny bit on the generous side like a jean jacket should be. love it.",5
Love this top! it's very simple modern design can go with many different bottoms and the soft pink color gives it a slight distinction from a plain white tank. love it!,5
"I really like the pilcrow denim military jacket. fabric is comfortably soft, but the jacket is still structured. love the tie detail in the back and the contrasting sleeves. i wear either a small or medium. i tried both sizes with this jacket and decided on the medium to allow for an extended season wear.",5
I have never loved denim jackets because they always have seemed kind of basic or boring. this one is edgy and the design is amazing. it can be worn with anything and will go through many seasons. i found the fit to be on point. my normal medium fit perfectly.,5
This jacket is perfect!! the denim mixed with the military style is such a good combo. it fits great and is very comfortable. the little ties in the back are a cute addition.,5
"I ordered this in yellow after the size small in store didn't fit. it's such a cute summer top, perfect with cropped jeans! i'm a 32b and usually a size small but had to size down. i could still see the top of my strapless bra in the front so i wear a lacy bandeau with it and it's super cute. because of this though, i wouldn't pay full price so i'm happy it was on sale!",5
"I hesitated to buy this after reading the earlier review, but went ahead anyhow, and am glad i did! i ordered the white in a small petite, and it is as cute as can be. it is crisp and true white, not off- white. there is a large pleat on one side of the front to give the blouse some interest, and there are openings on each side which allow the blouse to swing a bit but do not open up to reveal skin. it is not long, but by no means is it cropped. it is really sweet with slim jeans or slim printed",5
This top is easy to dress up with a blazer or wear casually with jeans and trainers. so many nice details and a great fit!,5
Absolutely love this jacket!! i convinced my girlfriend to get one too; we could not be more pleased. slightly oversized throughout the body - this is true no matter the size you buy - with great contrasting sleeves and back. the side ribbons can be adjusted to bring in or let out the waist. perfect spring/summer weight. can be worn with a sweater/sweatshirt underneath. it's a feminine takeover of a boyfriend jacket - looks gorgeous over a casual dress or great with jeans/chinos. perfect for mus,5
"This is a beautiful skirt. great, soft, draping fabric. fringed along the edges. i ordered size large, which was an okay fit, perhaps a bit wide but the drawstring helps at the waist. because i carry my weight in the tummy, this made me look wider than i am. as an elder, i just couldn't handle the length which hit me right at the top of the widest part of knee. i have great legs but my knees aren't their best feature. so sadly, returned but i do recommend.",5
"I have not owned a denim jacket of this kind in...15 years? i have a wonderful pilcro chambray jacket with a military cut from last year, but this kind of boxy, straight up denim jacket cut has not been a part of my life for a while. however, i was in a store last weekend and with the additional 25% off, i thought it might be wise to give this a try. i'm so glad i did. i've now tried it over two fairly girly dresses, with tights and booties (it's not exactly spring in boston yet), and i love it.",5
"This is a great sweater. it can be worn ""wrapped"" as on the model, or open like a cardigan. it is a lighter weight knit, perfect for how warm this winter has been. i love the deep purple color. normally between a small and medium and went with the medium in this sweater.",5
"Got this in purple and love it! ordered red and silver and only received red so far, but had to return because it was oddly shaped and didn't fit well like the purple. not sure what happens. maybe miss sized?",1
"These are really nice jeans (i am a jean fanatic). some ""patches"" are faded others are dark with still others with stitching across them. very distinctive and nice. they are truly a boyfriend fit...so, if you them big, they are. ag makes very nice jeans both in fit and quality. i buy other brands, but not often...",5
"I've owned a number of pilcro denim jackets it in my day. not because they've ever needed to be replaced, but because i'm obsessed with the fit, the color and the style. when i saw this one i knew it would be no exception! this jacket is even cooler looking in person. the fade on the denim is totally perfect. not too dark, not too light...and not so distressed that it looks sloppy. the denim is soft just like all other pilcro, and the fit is a dream. what i love the most is the interest in the c",5
"I saw this in store and had to try it on! it is really cute. i love the different textures and the red drawstrings. it fits well, although i am somewhat between the small and medium sizes. i went with the medium in case i want to wear a bulky sweater with it. really cute and i have never seen a coat like it!",5
"I love this sweater! i'm very sensitive to fabrics and this really doesn't bother me too much. it's soft, but just a tiny bit scratchy. but the color is a rich purple and the flexibility of being able to wear it draped or not is a nice touch. it comes right at waist length....little on the short side if you want to hide your muffin top, but otherwise a winner all around.",5
"The fabric is soft and the wine color is rich and a good alternative for black. i love it so much and bought the grey one as well. you can wear it open or button up like on the model. great layering pieces. i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.",5
Amazing jeans!! without pockets on the front there are no weird lines like there are on other white jeans with pockets. the high waist is extremely flattering! perfect for spring and summer!,5
"I saw this jacket in a store and wanted it right then and there. i bought a shirt and scarf instead but it was on my mind. when i saw it on sale i grabbed it. the fit is a little boxy but the length was perfect! not too short. the small amount of spandex is so comfortable. it is versatile because the green arms can go with colored jeans well. i am 5'4"". i can wear a med or large. i bought the large. it fits perfectly to layer short or long sleeves. not a typical denim jacket. looks great over a",5
"Fits well, super soft and very flattering. great for layering and for dressing up or down. highly recommend!",5
"I had been eyeing this sweater since it came in for the fall mostly because of the beautiful purple color. it finally went on sale and i scooped it up. like most reviewers, i luv that you can wear it two ways. i prefer to wear it closed as i do not have the slimmest waist and this sweater hides this well but it looks just as good open and drapes well on the sides. this sweater looks a lot better in person than online like most of the retailer sweaters. i have hand washed this a couple times alread",5
"This skirt is about an inch longer on me than on the model in photo (i'm 5 ft, ordered petite) but the length actually works. i have a bit of a tummy, so ordered size 4 - fits great. really love the colors - so many tops will go with this skirt, so it will be easy to vary the look.",5
"This an absolutely beautiful quality stylish coat but through no fault of the coat, i had to return it because i looked like a bear in it. i'm too short and too round around the middle for this type check and this type material. i wouldn't want to discourage anyone from trying it.",5
"This tank is an easy piece to add into your summer wardrobe and its amazingly affordable. i don't think the material is too think like the previous reviewer. i chose the petite size and it sits well at the chest and is a great length. not too long, but still able to front tuck. i bought two colors and am interested in all the rest!",5
"I'm happy to say i got this on the sale rack but had been eyeing this long before.  it is a flattering fit on me in size large.  i just love the colors in the print!  also, the style is not a basic shell but a very feminine cut.  the skinny straps are also a very nice touch.  i plan on wearing this with my long white linen skirt, denim capris or with shorts.  i think i will also opt for a solid cardi or scarf.  this is just so pretty!",5
"This is the perfect pencil skirt! the pattern is flawless!
the top shown with it here online is outrageously expensive! i paired it with a lace turquoise top that retailer has in stores and you can also wear it with a wine colored top. i would not wear it with black because you just lose the stunning colors.
if you love fall colors this skirt is perfect!!",5
Wore with leggings & ballet flats ??compliments!,5
"I bought this coat shortly after christmas and am in love. it is meant to fit oversize but runs true to your natural sizing. i am a m/l in most retailer clothing and that is what i bought. it is great for layering for a dressed up look with a skirt or dress for work and also dressed down with jeans a t-shirt. and, although the arms are 3/4 length it is super warm! so happy i purchased!",5
"Fits a bit on the bigger side, but also being the style of the top. i would order down a bit. i'm usually a 4 on top( 34c) and the xs was perfect. the wine color is classy. it's a timeless piece...",5
"This is a beautiful dress that glides over your body and swishes around when you walk. i received many compliments when i wore this, with black korkease platform sandals and peruvian opal jewelry. the fit is true to size, i took my usual size l. it is longer on me than the model, and my only complaint is the slip-it is very sheer and you can see your legs through the slip and the dress together, so i had to find a different slip. i think retailer should also make their slips a bit longer, i don't",5
Bought this on a whim and am so glad! this is made of the softest fabric and the loose flowing nature of the tank make it perfect over a bathing suit.,5
"Maeve consistently nails pencil skirts - i always know exactly what fabric and fit to expect, and it is flawless! the fabric is soft, lined, and has stretch. it feels as close to wearing sweats as you can in a skirt! the colors are beautiful on this - i'd say in person the colors are a bit deeper and richer than they show in the model photo. length is about the same on me as it is on the model at 5'7"" and got my usual s with no issue. this beauty will go with lots of different colored tops too,",5
I love the way this loosley falls and is so light you barely feel it on you. it is very sheer to you need to wear another tank underneath.,5
"I tried this on (blue) in size 0 or xs (not sure how sizing was), regular size (sometimes i need petite). i don't think i need petite in this one though, i love the peek of lighter solid fabric on the hem, the whole tank is very soft. probably need a strapless bra to wear it, but could be paired with jeans for casual look or nice pants. pencil skirt for dressier look. i am 115 lbs and 30 dd for reference.",5
"Such a beautiful pattern on a lovely fabric. soft to the touch and flows beautifully. i love the lacing and even the butterfly sleeves - which i'm usually not a fan or. i have a feeling i'm going to wear this to death once the weather warms up! my only complaint is the slip, which is a scratchy material that is also completely see through. it's also very short, at least for my comfort. i have a plain black slip i'll be using instead, which is fine with me as i bought the dress for the outer shel",5
"This shirt is very attractive! i tried on my usual size 2 and it fits like a glove. i wish they had more colors than ivory, but i couldn't pass up the unique fit and design of this shirt.",5
"I tried this on at my local store. i love the look and the color of the blue tank and wanted very much to like it. alas, it was not to be. the material is super thin (almost see-through) and it is of poor quality. i did not buy it.",1
"I love the style and look oft this blouse but the fit is a bit off for me. i'm usually either a l or xl. i don't think it came in an xl so i decided to give the l a shot. i would say it runs roomy except through the arms. i found the arms to run strangely tight...and it's not an area i usually have a problem with. the body skimmed nicely over my trouble spots (middle). i found the neckline very flattering and it laid nicely over by dd bust. the v is deep but you don't feel overexposed.

"Lovely dress ,comfortable fabric and great cut .
the combination of the alignment of stripes works beautifully and is very figure flattering.
versatile to keep casual or dress up with a great pair of shoes.",5
This is such a cute and different jacket. of course i asked if they had it in black but i am glad they didn't because this is such a great color that is so versatile. i use it as a topper when it is not that cold out with a short sleeve under it or a long sleeve fitted shirt. you can wear with jeans or black pants if you want. great material for the price as well. i am usually between a small but more of a medium in my jackets. i ordered this in xs/s and it has plenty of room to even wear a swea,5
"I purchased the black in the store and wore the next day. so soft and lays nicely, pretty sleeve detail. quality and fit as expected. the arm holes are a tad larger than i prefer, but i typically wear a camisole under tops so it doesn't bother me. for reference, i'm 5'8, 36c and purchased the medium.",5
"This dress is flattering, comfortable and beautiful. it hides my imperfections too. currently my favorite dress!",5
The softest tank i own. even though it's a soft burnout fabric it's still not too sheer. great quality,5
Beautiful top... the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school. it's a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but it's beautiful. definitely worth getting!,5
"I'm a power-walker. i bought this tank in 3 colors and rotate through them. they're great for working out with a nice sports bra underneath. i also wear them with leggings. so cute! love the colors, the fit. yes, they're thin. i don't think they'll last for years and years, but with the sale price they are such a great deal.",5
The material is thin and of poor quality.  it snagged the first time i wore it. the arm holes are very low as other reviewers stated.,1
This oversized coat is fabulous! i've received so many compliments on it.,5
"Great, comfortable tank. cool added detail in the straps. runs big so size down. i wear both a medium and large at retailer and got this in a small.",5
"I love this top. so much so that i bought it in black and red. i do think it runs a bit big. i normally wear a medium or small. i bought this in extra small and it fits beautifully. can be dressed up or dressed down. love that it is a double layered knit too. the fabric is soft and drappy. this is a staple top. looks great with a pencil skirt tucked in. got lots of compliments when i wore the red one. havent worn the black one yet. for reference im 5'9"" , weigh 125lbs and wear a 34b.",5
I bought this dress for my bridal shower and it is perfect. the pattern is beautiful and very similar to the image shown online. the fabric is much lighter than i anticipated which is nice for spring/summer weather. i had to get the top altered slightly to better fit on top but it was a very easy alteration. i am normally a size 8 in dresses and found this to fit very true to size.,5
"Is gigantic-it could be so cute, but the neckline and armholes are ridiculously low. i am 5 feet 10 and 140 pounds, and a small was huge on me.",1
"Purchased in the red and love it! love that it goes with anything from work pants to jean shorts. the ruffle details add just a little extra, which makes it perfect. i just paired with gray chinos a couple days ago and it made a lovely outfit. fits tts. i wear an xs and purchased that.",5
"I was on the fence about this toposition because, as others have stated, it is quite billowy at the bottom. just before returning i decided to try it on with a navy linen v-neck cardi and it completely changed my mind!! wow! now i am not saying that this isn't beautiful on its own, because.it truly is!! i am just saying that now this has become a truly versatile piece in my wardrobe. i did not order a petite even though i am 5'3"", and for that in am glad! i ordered regular size xs (108 lbs/36b)",5
"So comfy and well made, perfect to dress up or down, bought one and coming back for several more. cut a bit low in arms, lace bralette is perfect under.'' bought a small, length and fit similar to model",5
"Nice fit, stretchy fabric, but they do not stretch out of shape or so much that they are too big after wearing for a few hours. very true to size and great length. i am going to buy another pair because i know once i wear these out i will want a back-up!",5
"When i spotted this online i just knew it was a 'must have'. holding horses brand usually runs big on me, but this is a more fitted top. i ordered the size 4 & 6 so i cld compare. well, the 4 is a little snug in the bust area & the bodice seam falls high across the mid-bust area. except for that the fit is good. being cotton i realize it will probably shrink some when washed so i don't think the 4 works for me. the size 6 is much looser overall & the fit is much better in the bust area. the armh",5
Bought (on sale) the first to use for working out/yoga and they're perfectly suited for the job! so i bought 2 more (also on sale). has held up well in the wash so far and i've washed each about 3-4 times. runs a little large but it is a loose flowy top. normally wear a medium but got smalls in these.,5
I am very happy with the top.well made and beautiful color.,5
The length on these are great. they stretch but so far they don't stretch out. the material is a dark and soft. i am 5'6' and 135lbs. the size 26 fit great.,5
"This dress is beautiful and delicate, so flattering! runs a little big- slightly looser fit- got the size small, usually a 6-8, and it is perfect. the slip included is very sheer however, so i am using a different black slip for mine.",5
"I haven't taken this off since i got it. and since then, i've ordered two more colors. it's definitely sheer, but the blue isn't see-through, though i expect the lighter colors are. it is a distressed look, but super-soft, comfy, and perfect to wear over work out clothes or dressed up with jeans. really a nice summer top for hot days. i'm 5'4, 135 the and the xxs is perfect--drapey, but not baggy. very flattering straps too.",5
"The quality is there. these pants are just as pictured. very wide leg, romantic pants. the pockets lay nicely inside so as not to be bunchy like some pants do. these fit perfect and look great.",5
"Just picked this up at a store....had a terrible time deciding between the plaid and the chambray but went with the chambray. super soft fabric and not too short for a 55 year old. i'm 5'5"", 135 lbs, and 34 d and the medium is perfect. sometimes i wear a small but have broad shoulders so need the m in this. i'll wear without a belt...it falls nicely and is very flattering!",5
The fit of this sweater did not flatter my body-type. the top half did not fit well; the armpit area was loose fitting and the neckline was awkward.,1
Love this sweater! great quality & styling. slimming and the side slits add a feminine appeal. pair with your legging and boots and enjoy the compliments.,5
"The sweater is light and very soft. the silver banding on the neck, sleeves and hem make it easy to dress up.",5
"I'm 5'3"" with high waist and some booty. this dress has a fantastic, flattering fit. i paired it with the elita belt as opposed to the thicker belt on the long waisted model. (love the belt too, btw).  the fabric is soft and will pair well with tshirt or cami underneath. i plan to wear with brown booties as well as sandals. looking for a suede jacket now...",5
"I disagree with the reviewer that says these are more straight-legged. for me they fit tight throughout. sits perfectly on the waist with just enough stretch, but they still look very structured. i'm 5'0, 110 lbs and the 26 fit me perfectly. the length was perfect for my height. often pants are too loose in the ankle for me, but these are snug and perfect to wear with booties.",5
"Soft, comfortable material and flattering with or without a belt. i'm 5'10"", 130...typically wear a 4. the small fits me perfectly and even the sleeve length is long enough when unrolled. high hem hits me a few inches above the knee, low hem a few inches below.",5
This cardigan caught my eye and i had no idea how soft and wonderful it would feel so it's a win-win! it hangs a little boxy so i'll need to figure out how to style it so it's more flattering. the pockets are a pretty gold color (you can see it from the inside) and adds a nice touch of color. it's a keeper!,5
"I initially saw this sweater in the store and it really stood out. the rose pink color is absolutely beautiful and i love the glimmer band. it adds a beautiful detail to the sweater. the fabric is very soft. the only downside i see, is that lint did get all over the tank top i was wearing underneath. though i think that will change over time as i wear it more. it wasn't a huge inconvenience, which is why i still give this 5 stars. i am always a small at retailer, which is what i ordered, so",5
"Very feminine! comes with a coordinating cami. i liked it so much that i'm going to order the other color, too!",5
"Beautiful! caught my eye online. i had to order then reorder in a smaller size, but it is wonderful. colors are beautiful.",5
I ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru. it's true.. had to return it,1
"Love my jeans, fit great and very flattering. they are a tad snug in my usual size but i think with time they will stretch a bit. receive compliments every time i wear them. if they go on sale i will buy another. :)",5
"Really cute casual dress. wore it to a ""girls night"" out!! they all loved it. can't wait to wear it again with knee high boots!",5
"If you're on the fence about this dress - go for it! i am a huge retailer shopper but haven't ever been compelled to write a review until now.  this dress fits beautifully.  the materials is so soft and comfortable and the design of the dress is very flattering, with or without a belt.  i am 5'2, 118 pounds and i purchased the pxs. it's perfect!  i wore this with booties and received a ton of compliments. the fringe and hemline make this dress really stand out.",5
"I have a short torso and short arms, so i purchased this in a petite medium. i probably could've worn the ps, but i do like the little extra room. it is a classic shirt dress with just enough of today's trendy ""frayed edge"" to make it contemporary. the fabric is super soft and lays nicely. i can imagine wearing this through the seasons with a variety of shoes/legwear & accessories! looking forward to it.",5
"I probably would not have purchased this sweater had i only seen it online because i typically think wool is scratchy, but this sweater caught my eye in the store and it is as soft as a sweater can get. i love the pink with the gold trim. it is so soft and warm. i have washed and worn it a few times already and have not had any problems with stretching, either.",5
"Love this preppy sweater for fall. only detail i wasn't crazy about was the deep slits in the sides, it gapes a little oddly then around the pocket but not enough of a distraction for me to send it back.",5
"I must politely disagree with the previous review. i hesitated to order this item based on the reviewer below and i am happy to say this item is everything i hoped it would be! it looks exactly like the picture (fit, color, quality). being a silk top i believe this item was priced appropriately and the quality of the item does not disappoint. the pom poms are colorful and bright but not the least bit juvenile. this top is light and flowy yet flattering for hot, humid summer days! i will look for",5
"This top is a joke unless you are really into expensive clown wear. i thought this looked whimsical, fun and a well-designed piece when i saw it on line--especially at this high price. i started to laugh before i even pulled the entire top of out the bag when i got it in the mail today. it is not expensive looking at all, and the pom poms look like a sad craft project rather than a special detail. it is a bit juvenile too. even if you wore it and were going for ""ironic"", it would be difficult to",1
Great fabric. soft and easy to wear and goes from day to night easily.,5
Long enough to wear without leggings but also great with them. i also purchase the belt pictured and it looks as good in person as it does in the photo!,5
"This dress is amazing. nice material, comfortable and really flattering. slightly tight in the arms but otherwise perfect. highly recommended!!!",5
"I read all the reviews about the fabric being see through, but liked the dress enough to give it a shot. it is soooo see through. this trally could only be worn on a beach. very disappointed.",1
"I was really eager to receive this sweater, i was expecting the same as in the picture. i received it today and i am already returning it. first of all the sweater didn't look new, it is mostly shapeless, it has little balls and piling on the wool (what happens after wearing a sweater for a few months) and the metallic color makes it look cheap. in the knitting itself there are missing points and there are actual holes in some places. it is a beautiful design but other than that not even the col",1
"This sweater is super soft and the metallic banding is a really nice detail. the fabric could turn out to be a bit fragile though. if you have a chest, it may feel a bit boxier than you expect but i don't mind it for a comfy, cozy, soft sweater.",5
I can't believe that i'm the first person to write a review. this top is so cute. i tried it on in a store and loved it. the sales person in the store said that it had been flying out of the store as soon as they got it in. the color and print are pretty. the fabric is sheer and cool and comes with a cami.,5
Little boxy in the mid section; very very elegant and beautiful design!,5
"Love this dress! very soft and easy to wear. i'm 5'4"" and it hits the top of my knees which is perfect for me. can't wait to wear it with white leggings and boots this winter. i've seen several similar styles and tried on a few at other boutiques but they were thick material and bulky denim. this is the perfect, light and soft to the touch. highly recommend!",5
I wore this suit for the first time yesterday and the black inner lining is leaking and causing stains on the white sections. seriously bummed as this is a super lovely suit.,1
"This dress is gorgeous! pictures online do not do it justice! my only issue is that it is slightly sheer, even with the layers under the skirt. will probably require nude boy shorts. i would say it runs tts if not a little bit large. i ordered my normal size 6 and the band and bust are snug but not uncomfortable, but the back mesh portion is loose. it hits me about where it hits the model in length. i was able to find one that somebody returned in-store so that was helpful. for reference i am 5'",5
"Everything about this dress is just right! the hand of the fabric is soft and drapes beautifully, the cut is slender but forgiving, the length is short enough to be chic but not skimpy, and the fringe and hemline keep it from looking like every other denim shirtdress out there. i am 5'7"" 125 lb and got an xs. i love the versatility too--as a dress, jacket, under layer, with/without a belt. yay!",5
I was surprised retailer decided to ship this sweater. the sweater looks like it's falling apart and it is huge. i would not recommend this even at a clearance price.,1
Love love the fit and material. a must fall wardrobe.,5
"Everything about this dress is exceptional. the fit, material, workmanship, and style are wonderful. the dress even has 2 petticoats to make the skirt stand out. the dress is modern in style, yet classic.",5
"Love the fabric that c s uses--so very soft and pliable.  fit is tts with room for draping over figure flaws and great for layering while open.  but the high-low hem is far more extreme than the new ""action shots"" show.  i'm kind of over this trend but at the same time love this shirt dress.  i'm 5'3"" 140# 36d and tried on m but will order mp online because of length.",5
As someone that has many cardigans this one is one of my favs in my collection. i can dress it up or down. it is really soft and great quality. i only wish i had checked if it came in petite since the length is a little long.,5
"I am not a fray fan but this dress has a modern vintage look, and it looks tailored. check out the ruffle sleeves, surprising detail. size regular small falls right above my knees, perfect at the chest (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), but the sleeves are 2 inches pass my wrist. the ruffle sleeves are too pretty to be rolled up, so i got the petite s, sleeves at perfect length, torso fits better but length is an inch shorter (thank you, cloth and stone for finally making petite sizes).",5
"I saw the neutral motif in the ""there's only one left"" hanger in the store and tried it on. it's very pretty, cute and sweet. i wish the bottom flares out a bit more like a baby-doll look, but that's just my preference. i tried on size 2 and it's a bit tight in the chest area (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), so i think size 4 would fit very well. despite the pretty flower design, in my personal opinion, i think the price does not justify a pretty basic tank top and fabric.",5
This dress looked nice online so i ordered it. once it arrived i tried it on and it looked even better. the fit was flattering as well. very versatile piece in an interesting print. glad i caught this piece on sale!,5
Looked really cute on line. arrived with a large hole in the front! quality and look was very cheap!!! would not recommend this sweater at all. step it up please retailer!,1
"This dress is very flattering on. it fits close to the body but the layers are thick so it doesn't show too much. the material is stretchy and very cozy. i'm 5'4"", 130lbs and a 34c and the medium fit perfectly.",5
"This top is so cute on. would look great on anyone as the style, quality, and color is incredible. highly recommend, even at this price. you won't regret it.",5
Love this top! pretty details and true to size fit!,5
"This is truly a beautiful top. the beading and lace are subtle, but add such a special, feminine touch. i love the breezy, swingy shape. very flattering. this is one item i will be sure to treasure for years to come. love!!",5
I love this top. the picture does not show all the beautiful detail. i was so happy when it came in the mail and i unwrapped it. stunning!!,5
This is a great top. runs tts. looks great with cropped skinny jeans and booties or wedges in the spring.,5
"This is such a pretty top.  i love the mix of patterns. the colors are beautiful!  it really looks great on.  the peplum is very minimal in this top.  the entire top itself is somewhat oversized, but in a pretty way.  i bought this in a large and probably could have gone with a medium, but didn't want the length to be any shorter, so i'm sticking with the large.  for reference,  i'm 6ft and 175lbs.  i usually wear a size 10/12 or medium/large.  also, i didn't notice a puckering between the two m",5
"I love this top, the detail and embroidery make it great for during the day or at night. the small fits me perfect and i don't wear it with a camisole like some have mentioned, but might if i wore it to work",5
"Love the top! it fits perfectly. i was a bit worried it would look like a pregnancy top on me as i'm a 34dd, but it doesn't. i've received many compliments on the top, its incredibly well made and has beautiful detailing. it is sheer so you'll need something under. the material is quite light as well which is nice.",5
My new favorite top to throw on,5
"So first off, yes, these are almost mind-numbingly expensive. however, i think the design and quality are absolutely there. the label ""low-rise"" always makes me wary (as someone who is curvy, low rise often = muffin top danger and bad early 2000s flashbacks), but the low rise design of these is actually great. they are mainly low rise in the front, angling down slightly toward the button, and in the back they are, not super high, but more of a mid rise, so you won't have to be really careful ben",5
"A swing top by tiny done right. this is a well made top that fits in all the right places, no gapping arm pit! the fabric has a design in it and i think this is a blouse that can be worn all year. the blouse does run large and depending on the chest size, you may have to go down two sizes. i went for the large at first just because swing tops are so short but realized i would need a medium and the length was still perfect. it did not flare out to where you looked like an expectant mother.",5
"This is a wonderful, cheerful spring dress. the material is slightly thicker than expected. (i suppose i thought it would be a little thinner or more summery, but it really works for both seasons.). the fit is exactly spot on as i would expect for tracy reese. i'm 5'2"", 110, 32-24.4-32, and ordered the 0p. colors and fit are just like the product photo. highly recommended.",5
This is a great summer skirt that is good for work or casual wear. the fabric is soft and the colors go with most anything. one downside is it wrinkles easily.,5
"Fits true to size and has a great shape. i get compliments each time i wear it, glad i purchased it.",5
"Trying hard to stay away from tops that are basic tees and branch out with patterns and different cuts. never thought i'd find both in one top. love this! i put it on and knew i had to take it home. it's fitted but not, busy but just enough so, and it's made in the usa! can't go wrong.",5
"I'm so happy i decided to take a chance and order this top. it is gorgeous! so flattering on, the perfect length, beautiful colors. i could go on and on. peplums can be tough but this one hits perfectly on me. runs true to retailer sizing so stick with what you normally order. i'm 5'6"" and 125lb and the s was for me.",5
Cozy and nice quality. great fit and runs true to size. could wear this every day,5
"Purchased this dress for a garden wedding and received so many compliments. the print is very lovely and the fit was true to size. i was mildly thrown off by the waffle texture of the material as it caused the dress to be a tad clingier than the picture led me to believe, but it was not a deal breaker. loved that it was lined and, though feeling substantial, was not heavy and thus comfortable in 90 degree weather. looking forward to wearing this again.",5
"Big bust, smallish waist... this top is so cute and flattering! absolutely love it",5
"This is a treasure and ""must buy"", friends! tiny designs the most amazing blouses and shirts, and i feel stoked to have gotten this one. the level of detailed embroidery on the front and tiny silver and gold sequins on silver net lace at the shoulders is artistic and well-designed. i've always found the tiny brand to be predictably one size small, but, when i get past my ego and order one size up to a large, i am sooooo satisfied. this sartorial work of art is completely lovely! i have a busty f",5
This top is just a beautiful as in the picture. it runs true to size and has a beautiful flattering shape on. it looks great with jeans and sandals for a casual look but can easily be dresss up too. i'm 5'3 so sometimes i need petite sizing but i liked the length of the regular fit with this top. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.,5
"This shirt is perfect! bought charcoal and ivory. compliments galore, super cute with jeans, workout pants. love it!",5
"This is my first ever jumpsuit purchase, and i love it! the retailer by me luckily had an xs in stock for me to try, and it fit perfectly (i'm 5'7"", 120lbs, slim). looking at the pictures i was a little concerned the jumpsuit would be short, but the length actually hits me closer to my ankles (still a couple inches above). the jumpsuit feels nice and light and comfortable and not difficult to get in and out of. the embroidery detail on the shoulders is a nice touch and the print is fun. would defi",5
"How cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out. first of all, the smell was unbelievable! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that, it shrunk. even though i handwashed it, line dried it and pampered it to no end!",1
Sooo disappointed with how flimsy this fabric is. i think this is the thinnest of all clothing items i have ever come across anywhere in my life. this is really a shame because the colors are stunning and it is a nice shirt style. another con is if you have any bit of back fat it shows every lump and bump . i do not recommend unless you have a lean back and the cost was $5.00!!!,1
I'm not a blazer girl but this one is perfect in the sense that it's not overly structured and stiff. it is really soft and comfortable but still holds it's shape. i am planning to wear it with a tee shirt and denim or even some leather leggings (pilcro).i can see this being dressed up for work or church. a great piece for your wardrobe. i could have taken a small but decided on the medium in case i wore something a little thicker underneath.,5
Perfect fall top! extra long sleeves perfect for keeping the chill off.,5
"I really love this jumpsuit! i purchased it for my honeymoon and my husband loved it! i am 5'1 and 95 pound and i purchased the petite xxs - it fits very well! it is a comfy, thin and lightweight material, not too fitted, but definitely hugs my butt and thighs, more than my stomach and chest. i absolutely love this jumpsuit - colors are more brilliant in person! the only reason i put 4 stars for the quality, is because the first piece i ordered had a defective snap. i re-ordered the jumpsuit aga",5
"I was monitoring this sweater dress online for quite some time hoping it goes on sale, but as soon as i saw the lighter color sell out i decided to grab the blue version before it runs out as well. it's a simple yet comfortably beautiful dress at the same time. it looks about the same as it does on the model color/fit only in the neck is a little wider with bordered collar, which makes it more interesting. i'm 6ft tall 160lb, ordered a large and i felt the dress was a bit oversized, but with tha",5
"These pants are super flattering. they can be worn to work or on the weekend dressed up or down. they are slimming and fit very nicely. my only complaint is that they start to look worn, the black fades, as you wash them over time. please don't stop carrying them!!",5
I love that his blazer is soft and not so structured. so great for a business casual environment. the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe.,5
I love this tunic. i am 22 weeks pregnant and the large fit great. i wish it were a little longer but will be great with leggings and perfect for the fall/winter seasons.,5
"Really cute top, the material is soft and feels like great quality. love the loose cut and slight detail to the simple shirt.",5
"I love this shirt so much!!! i ordered the gray a day after i received the sage color. this shirt is soft, true to size, comfortable and extremely flattering. it is one of my new favorite go-to shirts. retailer - great job at finding a stylish, casual top that can take me through all the seasons.",5
"Never thought i would buy a jumpsuit, but this one is gorgeous. i put true to size. i ordered a m and a l. i kept the l because i like the looser fit. weigh 150# and am 5' 6 1/2"" tall. i carry any extra weight at my waist and the l just looked better. i almost always wear a m in retailer clothes. love the feel of it and the way it looks on me. really looking forward to wearing it. on sale it is a great buy.",5
"I purchased this in navy and love it. my only complaint is that is is a little big in the shoulders. i am about 5'4"", 129 lbs and the small is still a bit too big. aside from that, it is a great design and length and i've worn it both with jeans and leggings / boots.",5
Cute embroidered mixed textiled shirt. super comfy maybe runs a little small across chest but has a nice stretch so it accommodates well. a great transition piece.,5
"I was worried the green might be on the shiny side, but it's not. it's a really nice color for fall and the stitching is gorgeous. like in other tiny tops, this top runs small, so order up a size. in most of retailer tops, i'm a small or medium, but in this, i take a large --- a perfect fit. i'm a 36c. is a little on the pricey side, but got on sale, so all smiles here.",5
"This is a great shirt, fits perfect and super comfortable but you feel stylish and pretty",5
I purchased this jumpsuit in the store and i am so pleased with it. i am usually a 10 or 12 top and the large was good. the med was too tight on my bust. love the print very feminine without looking like pjs. cream background is beautiful. fabric is light and cool and i love the pockets. i was hesitant about the short length but i like it. this is a special piece. it's hard to find jumpsuits like this.,5
"Similar to the previous reviewer, i'm also between sizes and for pencil skirts it's usually the larger size that end up fitting. whether this skirt runs large or maybe because it has a slight stretch, my smaller size (10) fits perfectly and seems comfortable enough to wear on a long flight or road trip. the fabric is wonderful, the skirt length is great for work, and the styling is really nice with added detail of buttoned loops at the waist. if i had one negative comment it would be an itty bit",5
"I am an avid yoga fan so when i saw this tee i had to have it. i am usually a m/size 10 but as this tee is fairly sheer, i did better exchanging for a large. the fabric is so soft and it is very comfortable. a must have for yogis!",5
"I am currently studying at a university where i am constantly reviewed on how i dress. if i'm underdressed i get comments and if i'm overdressed i get even more comments. the other day i wore a plain navy blue blazer and people asked me all day what the occasion was. for me, this blazer is a nice solution to the standard uniform blazer. the stripes and light grey color make this blazer more casual for me, but i still feel put together for class. the fit is also excellent and doesn't feel boxy at",5
"I got this top in black and didn't realize until i got it that it has velvet accents. it is beautiful, sophisticated and can be a great party, work, or play top!",5
I bought this to use over the holidays. it is extremely comfortable and i've received multiple complements. you can dress it up or wear it casual.,5
"Really great shirt, i made the mistake of ordering normal size (xs) and it was way too small. this is more like ordering in dress shirt size- so think 4, 6, 8, etc, definitely going to have to send back and order up to s or m. will be a keeper once i get the right fit!",5
"Many thanks to all previous reviewers that convinced me to try this blazer. i bought it in navy and it is absolutely perfect. i love its simple lines, softness, and quality of the material. it transitions easily from work to casual. i paired it with mirabella lace top and skinny jeans for a look that is both practical and beautiful.",5
"Although this is not my husband''s favorite (he prefers things a little more tailored). i absolutely adore this! i got this in the ivory/cream color not realizing they had it in two more colors. i just ordered the blue. i loved the way the size small fit (not as wide), but the medium for my height (5'7"") fit better and was longer. if i want to wear it as a dress, i could. i highly recommend this!! well made and looks great!!!",5
I absolutely love this dress. the quality is perfection. the design is adorable and it is comfortable! i paired it with leggings and short boots and worked 10 hours in it. and i worked a large event so i wansup moving things and active almost the entire time. it was the perfect combination of dressing up for work yet being fully functional! oh and the neck line ads that extra touch of style that makes it a great piece. love this! it is also true to size. i have a medium.,5
"I got this in a medium, its really big, i added a belt and ir looks alot better, the medium seems like a large, im a size 6 or 8, should have gotten a small, now they are out will use the medium with a belt",5
This print is so cool! the shirt is just a little loose so order your usual size and it will fit perfectly.,5
"I tried this on as a fluke.  i work at retailer and like to see the fit of everything so i can talk about it with customers.  
it is so chic!  it makes your butt look amazing!  i tried it on with nude booties, but i could also see it with a great heeled sandal, or flats.  don't overlook this beauty!!",5
"This piece was so gorgeous that i bought it despite how impractical it is to wear it in honolulu. it's honestly the perfect little number to wear if you want to go for a late autumn/early winter stroll in the city. it's incredibly comfortable and versatile. i've worn it on cool mornings in honolulu as a dress with booties, and a few months ago, i wore it to minneapolis and added leggings and a warm pea coat. depending on how you choose to accessorize the look, it can be casual or professional. i",5
"This versatile tunic is a mini dress on me (5'3"" 36dd) when i wear size l and warm sweater when i wear size m. i love the boxy yet flattering cut, the cute neckline and the warm smooth knit fabric. wish i had gotten my hands on the cream colorway!",5
I purchased this sweater online and it's amazing. styling with jeans is nice but to me dark navy pants works the best.,5
"The design is so cute (people in different yoga poses, small and subtle prints) and a must for a yogini. i love the colors, it's colorful but not too bright and it's beautiful against the white background. i ordered xs (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it fit perfectly (it has a fitted look but not tight because it has some stretch from the soft cotton material). i like the fact that there's no stretchy spandex feel, just pure soft cotton feel. it's great for gals who are conscious about the arms",5
Love this top! it's light weight and very comfortable! it's great for wearing around the house or going out for a casual dinner. would love to get it in more colors!,5
I think this t-shirt is so cute. simple but cute. i originally ordered this in medium. i washed and wore it once but realized it was really too big. my normal size is small so i reordered it. it is slightly shear for my taste so i do wear a cami underneath. i plan to wear this to my 2 year old's gymnastics class. it is little yoga people but close enough! i normally hang dry all my clothes from retailer as they can be quite delicate but the first one i washed did wash well.,5
"I purchased this dress for a summer celebration. i am petite, but ordered the dress in a misses size (one size smaller) because i wanted it to hit right at the knee, rather than the shorter above-the-knee length pictured. i loved all about the dress - the fact that the colors are more vibrant than in the picture and that is has a beige slip.. i dressed it up with gold chandelier earrings and nude sandals and got compliments form almost everyone. i am planning to dress it down with espadrilles.",5
I am not a bright clothing person but adore this top. if this is the right red for you i highly recommend.! it is a beautiful bright red no orange tones so really works with my skin tones. it is a very comfy shirt and although it is a stretchy fabric it did not show any lumps or bumps in the upper back. has a beautiful flow to it and looks not only great with jeans but really cute with a patterned sweater pencil skirt i bought at retailer a couple years ago and always with a good old black pencil,5
My daughter tried this on in the store yesterday and loved it. it fits perfectly; true to size - the quality of the fabric and style is lovely. a fun jacket to layer with.,5
"I really love this pant. ordered online and they fit well. they're cute, edgy with the fray at the bottom. corduroy material. awesome!",5
"Love this dress. it is airy, lightweight, and comfortable - the kind of dress i'm sure i will wear all summer long. from the pics online i thought the sleeves would have embroidered detail, however it was just the print of the fabric. i like it just the same. it comes with a slip underneath so it swings nicely. i ordered it in both a s and xs. there is plenty of fabric and it is not at all cling-y so the xs was fine. excited to wear it!",5
"This is a review of customer service in general,from several issues with online shopping! i don't understand why you ask for my opinion and say it counts when clearly it does not.i have had a lot of issues. receiving parcels from one of your carriers,laser ship and i have reported the issues to them and retailer,but it appears only the good parts are read.this poor service cost me money in postage and lost discounts but again i'm ignored,and i had to order my last returned parcel again pay more fo",5
The title says it all. looks very pretty online though.,1
This is a perfect dress for work or fun. flattering and flow with lovely little subtle details.,5
I absolutely love this dress! the pictures don't do it justice. the colors and details are stunning! i have only worn it once this far but received a ton of complements.,5
"Plan to wear this with pants. may not fit some body types due to the tie and cocoon sleeve styling, but i recommend trying on before deciding. truly stunning athough the weight of the silk is very light. would have been better at this price point if it was heavier weight, but still not a bad value.",5
"Like other reviewers, i saw this dress on the cover of the catalog and knew i had to have it! well, i am very disappointed. the colors aren't as rich as the outdoor photo, although they're brighter than shown in the studio photos. this is just not a flattering dress. i've put it on three times and taken it back off. the neck is too high, the sleeves are too narrow (and i have really skinny arms), and there's no ""swing"" to it. i am 5'4"" and weigh 120 pounds and bought a size small, which is what",1
"When i'm looking for something comfortable to wear that looks effortless and cool, this is the top i pick! i ended up buying it in navy too. it's really soft, ur washes well, and it's great quality! a must have.",5
"This is wearable avant-garde fashion! yes, the swing is oversized...it's supposed to be. that's the design! fits perfect at arms and across the chest. i'm 5'3, 127 and orders a 2p. it's perfection! just understand what you're buying. high fashion. high quality.",5
"I am a huge fan of absolutely everything tanvi kedia designs. her clothing is intricate, boho, colorful and fits like a dream. when i saw this online i had to have it. it just arrived today and its everything i imagined it to be! the fit is more like the studio pics and less like the first catalog pic. the dress definitely has some room, but it isn't quite as swingy as the catalog photo. i have a lot of curves, so it may be swingy on a more slender figure. i ordered an xl mostly because of the s",5
"I bought this dress because i saw it in stores when it first came to retailer. it was stunning. the colors were vivid and the beading was intricate. i regretted not purchasing it immediately. 


fast forward to today... the dress i received was not the one that was originally in stores. the fabric was different, there was hardly any beading, and the colors were washed out and dull. 

i read previous reviews saying that the dress was more like the studio pictures than the original promo. but t",1
I decided to order both the black & sand colors in the m/l. very soft & fit is perfect. has adjustable straps. wore under my racerback tank today for my usual walk. the bra & straps were not exposed. it did not rub or irritate at all. it will work well under other tops i have & some dresses that are racerback style. i have other racerback bras but they just haven't worked out - either too uncomfortable or the straps show anyways. this one is perfect! it's soft & lightweight. it has some moderate,5
"I loved this dress online and was luckily able to locate it in a store about an hour away from me. i drove to the store to purchase it; however, when i tried it on, i was so disappointed! the print is adorable and it is made of great quality, but the swing style is definitely more than mini! i could have fit 3 of myself in this dress. it is definitely not as depicted in the photographs. also, the background of the dress is way more pink than appears in the photos, and the floral print isn't as r",1
"I love these pants! they are slimming, can be easily dressed up or down, and they are super soft and comfortable.",5
This top is absolutely gorgeous in person. i am usually a size 12 in everything..pants and tops but this one i ended up getting a size 10. definitely size down otherwise the top will slide back on you and the arm holes will be crazy big. but it's a great top for summer. very cool and light. and the v-neck back and front is just so pretty. great buy!,5
"Everything about this blouse is perfect - the color, the drape, the detail. so flattering and easy to wear. i just love it!",5
"This is a gorgeous, well-fitting top! i was hesitant to even try it on because i was sure it would require a strapless bra, which i avoid. nope. worked perfect with my nude bra. i am 32d so need a real bra, but wore an unlined, underwire bra with no show through. great with denim shorts or more polished with dressy pants or dark jeans.",5
"I never write reviews, but these socks are so worth it! they are incredibly soft, stretchy, and hug your feet just tight enough where you don't even realize you're wearing socks, but they aren't too tight.

i wash them straight away after wearing so i can wear them again. you won't regret it. true to color!",5
"This has become a go-to work staple in my closet. soft, with a relaxed fit, makes this a very easy piece to work the day away in while still pulling off a dressy casual appropriate for my office. highly recommend",5
"Ag jeans have become my favorite and these didn't disappoint. ridiculously comfortable! i think they run a tad big, but maybe not enough to size down. just enough to where i'll need to wash them more often, maybe.",5
"Love, love these jeans. being short they come right to my ankle. super soft and don?t require any hemming. i ordered my typical jean size of 26 and they fit like a glove. would love to have these in black and grey.",5
Ooo la la! sooo chic! sooo retailer!!,5
"Love this blouse, it fits tts, and it accentuates all the right curves. the color is a lovely shade of pale peach, and while it's true that some of the buttons aren't cut, it's an easy fix, you just have to take a small pair of sharp scissors, and carefully cut the uncut threads--it didn't even take me 5 minutes to do, then you can button or unbutton in whatever way feels comfortable for you. it just makes you look and feel effortlessly sophisticated. busty girls, don't be shy--i have a 34 h bus",5
This jacket is a neutral color with a subtle print that adds great character. the stitching around the edges is cute. the shape is very flattering and not too boxy as some open jackets can be. a perfect layering piece!,5
"This blouse does run large especially in the length of the sleeves (but the rest of the shirt fit well) pretty pretty blouse. hides bulges, runs a little long. super soft material. a must have for fall!!!",5
"This blouse is so much cuter in person! and it's more golden than yellow so it's not as bright which makes it easier for blondes to wear. i tried it on thinking i'd never be able to pull the color off but loved it enough to try, and wow so perfect! i had to get it and it was on sale. love this and happy to add it to my antro collection!",5
Beautiful and chic. so glad i tried it on!,5
"Love everything about this. the color is gorgeous - great fall addition to any wardrobe. the tassels are cool - usually don't like things like that.

i wear a small or medium in retailer, usually small, and i purchased the small.",5
"Haven't seen a top as fun and unique as this without being ""too much"" in a long time. i typically like a little longer with skinny jeans/leggings but this does the job of hitting at a good spot just at my crotch and the bottom of my behind. it's the right amount of swing at the bottom to wear out (not sure i could tuck it in and make it look right as in the photo), the ""bell"" at the sleeve bottoms adds just the right amount of detail as does the neck detail and ties. the color is beautiful and i",5
I am wearing these as i type this. they are unbelievably cozy. would wear them as loungewear if it weren't for the fact that they also look so so cute and i want to wear them out. so soft and a really good fit. higher than my other leggings so i don't have to pull them up ever. but also just really fashionable looking. love!!! one of my favorite retailer purchases ever.,5
"Very flattering and looks much better on than on the mannequin in store. i an in between small/medium and went with medium which was looser in back and did not show any lumps or bumps. great with jeans, pencil skirts and capris .",5
"White, lace, peplum...all my jams so this top was a no brainer order. what i didn't realize was how cozy the cotton would be. it was like just wearing a cozy tee, but looked so much better. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small fit perfectly.",5
The slubbed palette tee fits perfectly. it's very comfortable and looks cute with jeans. i'll be ordering more in other colors. i really like that its made in the us too.,5
This dress is thin and completely see through. it is definitely not worth the price tag. would be really cute in a thicker material.,1
"Great tee! color is vibrant, material is soft, fits great.",5
"So i almost returned this top without trying it on because i've been binging on tops with thin blue lines but so glad i didn't!! i'm busty like ddd36 and i weigh 170, but i got the 8 and it fits like a glove! perfection!! plus i got it on sale!! so fab!",5
"I love this shirt. i actually bought two in black (my ""uniform""), then decided to order one in white as well. however, the white shirt fit differently than the two black ones! it was significantly shorter; over 2' shorter! while the black tee is the perfect length, the shorter white version wasn't flattering on me and kind of flared out around my waist...not the best look. that being said, i know the black shirt will be in heavy rotation for a while, and the people at retailer were very und",5
"I love this blouse! it is such a classic silhouette. the fit is not so loose on me as the model, but i have a much more curvy figure at a size 14/large. i am completely coverd up in this top, and the waistline is incredibly flattering to a full figure. the lace makes this top easily able to go from dressy to casual. i can see myself wearing this top again and again. great purchase.",5
"These pants are a must for any girl's summer warm weather wardrobe! i tried them on in the store and loved them. but... i am just over 5' and they were too long in the xs, even with 2.5 inch heels. so i ordered them in an xs petite and they are perfect with my 2.5-3 inch heels. 
i love that they are wide-legged! they look cool and are flattering! i am a teacher and plan on wearing them to work during the warmer months with a nice solid tee and a statement necklace. and of course, heels. i highl",5
"I could not resist this top. it is super cute, the material is nice and thick (you can get away with wearing no bra). shows off your bronzed or creamy skin to perfection. i can't wait to wear this :). i think the cut is very flattering for all figures. top might be a bit tight for very big busted ladies though.",5
"Love the pleating on this top. looks great with my
white jeans. it's lightweight and has a slight sheerness.",5
"Love this top, the contrasting lace/eyelet is pretty and interesting. it flairs in a flattering way.",5
"I tend to go back and forth between small and xs and i""m glad i got the xs... its great and still flow and not huge. to wear alone you need a strapless but i am happy it has adjustable straps. the lace on the back is fabulous snd the colors in this are so lovely! it has olive green and deep orange, two of my fall favs! i wore with my level 99 deep orange linen pants and an olive green little jacket over it. would also be lovely with jeans and booties... a creamy cardigan or a little blazer. i th",5
"I don't know who this would fit. looks so cute on the model and i thought this was going to be the perfect between season dress . . . but just looked like a sack! i think the ""knit"" must have stretched into an unnatural shape - especially the arms!",1
This dress is so pretty and the neckline is darling!,5
"This dress is beautiful and timeless. i wore it to a wedding and received so many compliments. i love how i can also wear it to so many other engagements. i plan to wear it for mother's day brunch, a friend's wedding shower, and know that the clasic cut will be a staple in my closet for years to come. the quality is what you expect for the price and is well worth your investment.",5
Love the muted orange color and the design. it's lightweight and will be perfect for fall days!,5
"This blouse is so beautiful and feminine. it fits loosely and is see thru, so you do need to wear a cami underneath it. it is very comfortable to wear. i got many compliments when i wore this blouse. all the delicate lace on it just makes you feel very pretty in it. however, be extra careful when you do wear it. i'm still not quite sure how it happened, but the lace in the front got a small hole right in the front on my first time wearing it. it's so pretty i just hope i can get it fixed so it w",5
"Love, love, love!
this is true retailer! from the style to the mix of sweater types and the ""surprise"" pleats in back! 
i wore it for the first time yesterday and received compliments all day! 
so glad i bought two colors!",5
"Perfect! wanted a dress for a mexican vacation. this fits the bill exactly. fabric has enough weight to hang well and cover any ""flaws"". love!",5
I love this sweater. i bought it in black and love the way the back falls gently and flatters my figure. i'm curvy on bottom w/ a butt and tummy so i like to cover them but i don't want to look like i'm wearing a moo-moo. this top looks chic. it's the right shape to flow gently. it's just the right detail to be different in an understated way. i wear it w/ leggings and jeggings because it falls low enough to cover my butt. neckline is good-- i'm a 34b and it's flattering. not sure if it will fla,5
"The tank looks nothing like the one pictured, mainly because it's tissue-paper thin. also, i ordered it in two sizes - xs and s as it can be hard to tell which one will fit. i started with the xs and quickly discovered that it ran large. the armholes hit halfway to my waist. obviously i didn't even bother opening the size s. both will be returned.",1
"Yep, i used to have a nice body, but now have the dreaded menopause stomach... and some excess baggage. this dress was very flattering. wore it today, easter sunday and had literally a dozen people seek me out to tell me how great the dress was or how nice i looked. it is a bright pink, think pepto bismol! heavy brocade type fabric plus a great cut = hiding my stomach and rear!! plus the lower neckline emphasized my nicer areas! very pleased to find a dress for us older women to look fresh and f",5
"From the website picture (in particular, the gray one) this may appear to be ""over-sized."" i can assure you, it is not. i have to return the small i ordered on the over-size assumption, and hope the medium (my usual size) fits because it's a really nice top. the sleeves and the pattern of the weave give it good pizzazz.",5
This is a super comfortable and flattering dress and i get compliments every time i wear it! highly recommend!,5
"This dress is amazing! it fits true to size, very flattering and the fabric is beautiful!
i am 5'4"" and it felt a little long for me so i am having it hemmed up one inch, but others may like the hemline just as it is. i like my dresses just right above my knee and it was hitting in the middle of my knee.
just love everything about it and would definitely recommend it highly!",5
I bought the lavender one and i'm so glad i did. the sweater looks prettier in person and it's super soft! the back detailing makes this one not your average v-neck sweater. i highly recommend this to anyone!,5
"This dress is very flattering and tts. i bought this dress for my brother's wedding at the end of june. i love that it is machine washable, which was the reason i chose this dress instead of another. as another reviewer already mentioned, it is brighter than photographed.",5
"So comfy. i'm 5'8"" a-cup & it fits well. i bought a small. an acquaintance of mine has it & she's petite w boobs & it looks great on her too. she has black & i have lavender. great purchase!",5
Such a great dress! it is super flattering. i love that its not too short on me(i am 5'11).,5
"I'm very pleased with my purchase of this dress. it is perfect for dancing or a spring/summer wedding or doing out. it is very flattering on my rather straight/slender/petite frame. i ordered a size 4 and it was tts. if it only had pockets, it would be absolutely perfect!",5
"Could not resist the fit and detail on this piece - couldn't wait for it to go on sale. the material is so soft and comfortable. it's ""just"" a black sweater - but the neckline and back details make it unique! thought i would need a large but the medium fit fine. 5'7"" 147 lbs",5
"I found this pretty sweater to run true to size. i am between a size large and extra large and the large fit well. it is perfect in the shoulders and body skimming without being too flared at the hem. the lavender is a dreamy light sky blue, true to what my monitor shows. i rarely wear anything but black and gray, but i could not resist this color. the sweater is a medium weight and i anticipate wearing this at the beach with white jeans and now with pale gray narrow wool pants. i really like th",5
Love the crochet and and it is a great feel with a liner underneath that comes with the dress. a little boxy but another beautiful retailer dress overall :),5
"This top is gorgeous and it fits much better in real life than pictured on the model. the back is made of soft cotton crochet and it curves beautifully on your lower back emphasizing your lower assets and if you have great shoulders and arms you're going to love this top because your shoulders will stand out. it's made of a light weight linen-cotton fabric. it's very soft and doesn't wrinkle as easily as most linen does, it feels soft on the skin, light-weight, and has a nice bounce to it. it's",5
"I have to admit, seeing these tops online, i wouldn't give them a second glance, but at my local store they were displayed in a gorgeous summery fashion and were so light and airy and flowy (my summer checklist!) i bought both the blue and rust color in an xl. i am a 16/xl/36h and this is one of the few button up shirts that actually fit! i think i might go in and add a snap between the bust line anyway since the buttons are spaced too generously, but there is no pulling. this top does run long,",5
"This is a beautiful dress. figure-hugging but covered up in places that need it. color is flattering and soft. wore with bainbridge layered necklace. bought for an afternoon function and wore with pumps. so versatile, will work for church or cocktail party.
great purchase!",5
I really love this top. they show it's as a bathing suit cover up in the pics but i will wear mine as a top over a cami. it's beautiful and looks expensive. (it is). had to exchange my usual size for one smaller.,5
"I bought one of these in store and then ordered two more online! i love this top. it's loose and hangs just right. i have gotten so many compliments on it. very comfy and cute. pockets too, which is always a plus.",5
Great dress! i ordered the extra small petite and it fits perfectly!,5
"I just love this. well made, nice fabric and looks just great over pants or jeans. im very pleased with this quirky piece and got it on sale too!",5
This dress is absolutely like a layered cloud! the material is amazingly soft and comfy.,5
"I really love this dress, it hangs well and clings in all the right places. i ordered this online and the store that sent it had left the security tag in. i sent it back. the tag was taken out and the dress returned very quickly, and without cost to me.",5
This dress is exactly what i needed.  it's so easily dressed up or down.  heels and jewelry for cocktail this time.,5
"Fabulous with leggings. i am 5'1"", 105 lbs and always wear pxs. the pxs was too large and fit like a ps, so order a size down. i really like it, and going to exchange for a smaller size.",5
"I ordered this in cream during the 25% sale. i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty, but it was not my size, so i didn't try it on. when it arrived, it was a wrinkled mess. it was so wrinkled that i don't think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily. i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer. it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular. it was also way too short for me. i'll be taking it back very soon. i do plan",1
"I just got this in the mail and wore it for the first time today. it is a beautiful top, the crochet portion of it is very well made and overall the top hangs nicely. the linen though is a little bit rough and scratchy. the lining underneath seems a little delicate and is not stretchy so i felt at moments while sitting that i could have just ripped it with one wrong move. the linen also wrinkles pretty easy in the mid-belly section so there is an ugly line going across, a problem with a lot of l",5
"I love this dress. i'm 5'8"", 160 lbs and have no hips, no butt and no waist. i have no curves and thin muscular legs. it's like wearing a cardigan and dress all in one. i paired it with ivory tights and dark brown boots and received tons of compliments.",5
"I really did. here's why i just couldn't: the lace strips make it look cheap. the fabric is soft, , but the pattern is undistinguished. 
the fit is very disappointing--medium looked square and boxy, the large was massive and in both sizes the v-neck was too low to wear without a camisole underneath....which defeated the purpose.",1
"I can't wear this without getting dozens of compliments. plus, it's comfortable! it's very soft. it is perfect with skinny jeans and boots, with pants, or with skirts. i have paired it with pretty much everything in my wardrobe. everyone wants to know where i got it! it's very well made and the embroidery is well done. it doesn't look like it is going to come undone anytime soon.",5
"I am a pilcro hyphen girl, and now i have these pants to love as well, super comfy and cute, the print is nice and subtle. i'm usually a 29p but the 29 regular is fine.",5
"I usually have a hard time with the sizing as retailer carries so many designers but this dolan top fits absolutely true to size. i am an xs and it fits perfectly, drapes exactly as shown and overall, looks exactly as pictured. the color is an off-white with gold beading and tiny white sequins on a mesh overlay which is lined so there is no show-through which i was concerned about. it is not boxy due to the fabric which is very soft and drapes nicely over your curves. there is just enough b",5
I bought this dress for summer celebrations. the fabric is beautiful and the colors are soft and enhance the flow of the dress. the fit is true to size and i especially like that it is not too low cut in the front. i will pair it with a light sweater or denim jacket. definitely a dress than can be dressed up or down. very feminine and has a romantic feel.,5
"Not long ago, i bought a pair of hei hei pants that i love, so when i saw these, i immediately tried them on. i love them too. they are pretty and comfortable, and i am so happy to get away from tight jeans! they are also very flattering. size wise, i find that i have to size down with hei hei, perhaps because they have a looser cut.",5
Not much to say. fits tts. a beautiful top. colors are striking!!,5
I ordered this tunic in xl and it fits me true to size. it's such a fun piece to wear. i like all of the embroidery which was done in beautiful colors and stitched well. the different fabric and the cut make this a very flattering top. i tie in the green and pink in my jewelry and sweaters when i wear this. it's so comfortable too. i'll get good use out of this top for winter. i like the uniqueness of it.,5
This is a beautiful piece that can be paired with multiple ways.. the color is rich and classy,5
"This dress turned out to be a huge disappointment!!! i was in loveee with the picture! in real life, not so much. the material felt thin and cheap! and the yellow was super yellow! nothing like the picture. i was so bummed! returned it earlier today...",1
"I love these jeans! i am always reluctant to change brands, but these are the best! i was pleased from the minute i took them out of the package. the fit is perfect: very skinny, but not too tight! they retain their shape over several wearings, too. the color is a great dark navy. looking forward to a long relationship with these! it's love!",5
"Love the color, fit and feel of these jeans.  the thin material is stretchy and comfortable. i didn't have to pull them up every so often during a 3 hour party.  they didn't bag out after the first wearing and are true to size.  i got a 27p (5'2"", 115#).  the leg length is perfect and ends at the ankle.  the rise wasn't too low for me.  highly recommend!",5
"I didn't think i would like this blouse when i saw it on the website but once i tried it on i was sold. yes, it is see-through but with a cami underneath this blouse can be worn both casually and to work. the best feature? even though it's silk and the tag says ""dry clean only"", you can absolutely hand wash this blouse in cold water and air dry. i did and it came out perfect with no wrinkles! i took my usual small (i'm 32c and 122 lbs) and love how versatile this blouse will be.",5
"I got lots of compliments!
fabric is thin but not too thin, perfect for summer and fall. you can roll up higher or even down to full length or ankle (depends on your leg length). 
fit is relaxed but not too loose. these pants are stretchy and very comfortable. i have bigger thighs & calves with small waist and flat butts, i am definitely not a fan of skinny pants/yoga pants, so i often have problem finding the perfect pants that don't show off the silhouette of my bottoms. these pants solved a",5
"I recently purchased this tunic on sale. the cut of this top is flattering on my curvy figure as it has a cinched in waist. the embroidery is lovely and very bright with several shades of colors. i wore this with black leggings,boots and a green cardigan and received many compliments.",5
"Material is slightly thin- good transitional dress for spring or fall. the waist is not quite as fitted as i would like, but the neck and sleeves are perfect. the length is good, but i am short 5'1"" and 105 lbs- xs fit pretty well. a really good purchase- more of a workhorse work dress, and not a wow dress on me, but nice to pair with blazers, jewelry. don't regret the purchase. very comfortable. got compliments when i wore.",5
"This is festival dress epitomized. flowery, flowy, romantic styling. so many layers in a muted color pattern, but also retains heat since it's all polyester. good thing the skirt is swishy to air your legs out. my distress is regarding the length. petite was sold out so i bought the regular with the intention of wearing platform wedges. it's still too long! if i hem, i will lose a lot of the pretty blue pattern.",5
"I had hoped this bulky knit would be cuddly and soft, with suri (a type of alpaca) in the title. i don't know if the blend (45% polyamide, 25% royal baby alpaca, 20% fine merino) threw it, but had i felt this in store, i would never have even picked it up. unimpressed.",1
I had been eyeing this top for awhile and decided to get it when it went on sale. it is a very nice top. i'm going to pair it with jeans and boots for our florida fall but could see it working with a nice pair of pants. it is roomy so if you're looking for something more fitted than i would pass on this top.,5
"I love this shirt! it's gorgeous! got it last night, wore it today, and received compliments all day long.

i don't normally look good in tunic length tops, but somehow there's magic in this one. the seaming on the front totally hides my post-baby pooch. too bad the baby just turned 3 and my pooch isn't going anywhere ...!

adore.",5
"I love this dress.
it is so cute!
i have another dress from the same brand (hutch) in almost the exact same shape/style so i was excited to see this one is so similar to the other dress i love.
i am 5ft 8in and 145lbs, and medium fits perfectly.
it's snug at the top (but not tight) and the skirt is full but not too full.
the fabric is slightly thinner than i expected, but still like it a lot. if i could change one thing, it would be one inch longer....hits a tiny bit more above the knee than i t",5
"Just bought these. they are my fourth pair. they are comfy, flattering and versatile.  i pretty much live in these cargos on the weekends.",5
Very flattering. i am 36c and short torso and the small fit like a glove . the medium was a bit loose and gapped some on the side of my breasts. need to wear strapless bra. really cute style and goes with several of the patterned capri pants i bought at retailer this spring !!,5
I fell in love with this shirt in the store and it has become one of my favorite items in my closet! the bright pink contrasts perfectly with the white peplum bottom and the fit is wonderfully flattering!,5
"I love this top! it's the perfect lightweight top for summer and the details are so feminine and pretty. the fit is extremely flattering. the arm holes are not too large (i.e. do not have to worry about exposing bra). i think you can dress it up with heels, wear it casually with shorts, & also pairs perfectly with kimonos. i'm 5'4, 130 # and i took my usual retailer size in this, size small.",5
Love the blouse and the best part is the back side ! this brand never ceases to fall short for fit and style. try it on to see,5
"Tried the xs in store (and 115 lbs, 30dd, 5'1.5""): fit like a glove, the chest part was fitted on me, the white is almost not see through, but nowadays, that seems acceptable (see though). the material is typical of meadow rue, cotton like, and airy. it is a basic white with styling. the top part also has some dimension, i overall thought this would look nice with my white shorts or with some nice jeans and blazer.",5
"Love this top, the cut is nice and is similar to the previous one that was denim, love hte colors, but they looked awful on my skin tone unfortunately.

sizing is true to size, i tried on the regular size, not petite, and it was fine (my usual 0 or 2, went with 0 as tjhis top is a looser fit, 2 would be boxy). the lace part is a nice added detial, the plaid is soft flannel. color is a salmon colr, with navy, but the dominant color washed me out (i am fair). love it otherwise!",5
"I love the color block concept but this top was way too boxy. the shirt was pretty much square. and the top was super itchy, too. looks so cute online but no-go in person.",1
I received this in the mail today and i liked it from the minute i tried it on and looked in the mirror. it is a unique piece to compliment black pants or jeans. i hope to be able to wear it with leggings if it covers my bum so i will have to try it on with leggings to see. the fabric is nice and it fits well and compliments my figure. it is longer as it appears on the model. i do recommend you give it a try especially at the sale price!,5
"This is a beautiful, simple, yet feminine top. a little tight in the bust on me - so i had to size up (and i am not busty). for reference, i am 117 5'3 34b. i'm probably in between a small and x-small on this - but went with the small.",5
"I love this shirt, i had my eye on it for awhile but wasn't sure what size i'd be, so i went to the store to try. they only had a small which i figured i would be but it was a little large and not as fitted as i would like it across the chest. i got an xs and it was perfect; i am 5'1 about 120 lbs and a small c cup and it fits great. i love it!!",5
"I like the top; like the tie in the front. the material is stretchy. would imagine this will work for any size of chest. i wear either a small or medium, so thought i'd be safe order the medium, which turned out to fix more like a large. i'm taking it back for the small.....as it's a keeper.",5
"I am currently loving anything that crosses or ties around the stomach area to hide what's left from my most recent pregnancy. this tunic fits the bill. the material has the perfect amount of stretch and the length was just right. i am very petite and bought my usual size xs. i would have liked to try this tunic in a petite size, but then it  may have been too short. i plan on wearing this to work with leggings and for running errands once the weather warms up.",5
"I wasn't immediately attracted to this shirt, but decided to try it on. i loved it on!
it is comfortable and very flattering. i'm a small person, and the length wasn't overbearing on me. it was full, but the stitching around the chest gives it shape and is flattering to a smaller chested person. i'm not sure how it works on a fuller person, but my guess is it may surprise you!",5
"Love, love, this top! it's flattering (shows off your shoulders) soft and has delicate embroidery. i typically order a xxsp in antro tops as i'm very petite but decided to order both xxsp and xxs, just to see the difference. the xxs worked better as the xxsp was too short in length and kind of looked like i was trying to fit into a child size top. the xxs is a perfect length. it's my new favorite and i can see keeping this in my wardrobe for a long, long, time.",5
"The lightweight knit and flattering colors made this top so perfect for me that i bought it for full price. it's big, so i'd size down. you'll still get a forgiving shape, flattering colors and just a really nice option for work or off hours.",5
"This top is fun, in a soft fabric - i got the navy ad bright - great for summer. but top does run large, i usually get a medium, but sized down to a small.",5
"I read the other reviews before i ordered this top and was a little concerned about the fabric, but it's fine. the neutral color is a little bland, but i can wear it with bright pants. since i expected it to run large i ordered a small. the tie in the front makes it fit like a dream, plus it looks amazing from the back.",5
"Love this shirt. i am actually pregnant and this shirt ties right over my baby bump to make for a very flattering pregnancy shirt. i will definitely be wearing it post pregnancy as well since the tie is an actual tie and you can tie it however tight you want for a more fitted or loose look. i am 5'4 125 lbs (not pregnant) and got a size small. and it fits perfectly. covers problems areas of butt and upper thighs, yet accentuates the waist. and thinner area of legs. very soft fabric, a bit stretc",5
"Love this top. it's very comfortable,  and flatters  my midsection. versatile piece.",5
"This top is really pretty. i love the details on the back tail of the shirt. the colors in this shirt are really pretty more like a peachy pink to me. i will however line dry this shirt because of the different fabric on the tail of the shirt. i would not iron that portion of the shirt either. overall, i am completely in love with this shirt. it will be a staple in my closet.",5
"I love this tee! i got the navy color and the quality is good. it's a light and soft linen that is opaque. (i can't vouch for the other color though). it's a very loose fit,but it's not boxy and the sleeves are still well fitted and comfortable instead of gaping or huge. i'm very short and the xsp comes to my hip. i'm almost tempted to get the other other in regular just so i can tuck it with skirts and pants too... the only issue i could see is that because the neck is a bit wide, it might show",5
This top is the perfect combo of function and flair! the style of the top makes it easy to wear and the back detail is just lovely. i love that it can be worn as either a buttoned-up top or a light over-shirt with a t-shirt or camisole underneath. i would pair this with blue or gray skinny jeans.,5
I am very pleased with this purchase. a nude colored racer back bra works perfectly under it and does not show through.   i have worn this with jean shorts and linen pants and it looks great with both. it is slightly on the dressy side so i also plan to wear it to work  paired with a skirt or dress pants and a cardigan.   i am a 34a  and size small  fits nicely.,5
"I saw this shirt and it was love at first sight. i have never had so many strangers randomly compliment me until i wore this beautiful top. fits great, looks even better.",5
"This was such a great top! see thoughts below!

___________
pros:
- fits tts. for reference, i'm 5'9, 36c, hourglass. i'm normally a m or l (10 or 12) depending on the fit and found the medium to fit well and not be too tight at all. i could have probably sized down for a snugger fit, but i like the looseness. fit very well across the chest and arms.
- the sleeves are surprisingly flattering. i've dealt with other tops where the sleeves flutter too much and adds too much weight and attentio",5
"I love this top. i've washed it a couple of times now and i can say it holds pretty well unlike what another reviewer said. it's very good quality, for me it is true to size, i'm 5'2, 127lbs, 36b and the small was perfect. i wear it with a strapless bra. overall, a great purchase that i can pair with almost anything.",5
"Such a great shirt! loved the fit and how it feels! i paired it with grey jeans!
loved it so much i ordered it in another color for myself and ordered one for a friend!!!",5
This shirt is extremely soft and fits well. great length and perfect casual shirt for fall.,5
"I so wanted to love this suit. it was gorgeous - the color, the quality, the style, but i am returning and can not recommend it. the sides need to be connected just a little bit higher and i think it would work, but there is no way you could move around in this without things popping out in front. i mean it would be gorgeous to just lay there in the sun, but i didn't feel like i could even walk safely, and i am not well-endowed. very bummed but it's going back.",1
"Very elegant feel and look. love the side zip, sliming feature. great all around pant to dress up with heals or boots for work.",5
"I bought these pants in the green and in black. they are the most comfortable work pants ever! almost as if you are wearing leggings and not pants. the material is really thick hiding any imperfections.the satin detail allows for them to be a little more dressy. i am 5'6"" and 155 and i ordered a 10. they are a little large in the waist but a perfect fit everywhere else. the also hit right below my ankle bone. i highly recommend these pants for anybody who is on the go for there job a lot because",5
"This dress is just right for weddings and all-
it fits nicely-the skirt makes it fun and it feels so comfortable-it
is just a perfect solution for fun evening dress-
i always carry a camera to weddings and this will be so great to
wear while i am taking photos.
it looks current but easy to move around in-",5
"Just a wonderful shirt -- fabric is so soft, it feels like pajamas, and the blue is just perfect. there's a different blue plaid as a lining, and i almost wish it was reversible. they're both great patterns! wonderful for fall...",5
I am loving this shirt. i thought it would look ridiculously long on me but it does not. for me this is a great substitute for the cloth & stone fringed plaid buttondown dress. it's definitely not a dress but is long enough to pull off the layered look of wearing a t-shirt and this on top. it will be a great piece for the fall given how incredibly soft and light weight it is. highly recommend.,5
"I am so glad i did not wait to order this dress. the fit is great and is made with great material. i am 5' 7"", 110 lbs and ordered a 0. often i have to have a dress altered but it is not the case with this dress. the length falls right at my knee. it is not shown in the photos of the dress but it has a buttoned back slit that has two buttons with a bright orange trim along the slit. a very cure feature. the bright blue back drop is hard to see on the photos as well but is nice.",5
"I purchased this shirt in two colors. it was a bit longer than i was expecting. i'm curvy  5' 2"" 180 lbs 36dd and the large fit perfectly.",5
"Great colors, style and fit",5
"I was hesitant about this one since i've tried cloth & stone shirts in-store and found them to be tight in the shoulders and arms. i have athletic shoulders and arms, so i didn't have high hopes for this one. i tried it on in-store and it's surprisingly true to size. i always wear m in tops and this fits perfectly. it is long, but i like that there's enough length that i can tuck it in. for reference i'm 5'3"", 130 lbs, a cup, 17"" across the shoulders.",5
"I had been looking for a new plaid shirt for fall. this one is perfect! the yellow is muted, but i really like it that way. other reviewers have commented on poor quality, but it doesn't seem that bad to me. definitely recommend!",5
"This shirt is so cute! i was unsure about how flowy the sleeves would be- as i'm not one for frills- but the sleeves sit nicely. also, i am between a size small and medium, i got the small and it definitely is flowy. runs big, so if you like a tighter fit you may want to order a size down. i got the red and it's a perfect autumn / winter color. the cut outs are not too showy- so it's not revealing for us gals who are a little more belly-conscious. it's the perfect shirt to just throw on and go a",5
"Wonderful shirt, soft and flattering... usually wear a medium, but got the large to layer over tanks and leggings. could have easily worn a medium, but large is not frumpy at all",5
Beautiful blend of colors and the texture of the shirt is so soft...perfect fall weather garment!,5
I didn't realize how much i would love this. wore it to work the other day and got more compliments than i have in a very long time on an outfit! it's comfortable and easy and flattering. bought this totally on a whim and so glad i did!,5
I love this dress! the design and colors used are beautifully done. it looks stunning on. can be worn for work or dressed up.,5
Thicker than you think...the colors are gorgeous and remind you of the changing of the seasons. can not wait to wear when the weather gets cooler. retailer did not disappoint. plan to purchase in other color soon.,5
This shirt is like the best worn in flannel with a little feminine flair! super soft and great length.,5
"This shirt is made of fabric so soft you can practically feel it with your eyes. i saw it right when i walked into the store and knew that i had to have it. it is unlike any fabric i've ever had: a soft two-ply, almost gauzy cotton. one cute detail is that the ""inside"" layer is a smaller windowpane plaid than the outside layer. so cute! and so soft! one thickness above cheesecloth, i would say. and like cheesecloth, it has a natural ""give"" within the weave, but it is not stretchy. the shoulders",5
"The material is super soft and the color is spot on. i have red hair, so purchasing a top in any red tone can be iffy...great transitional top for spring, summer and fall seasons! i accidentally dried mine, (thankfully only on the lowest heat setting) and it shrunk, but just the length a bit. one of my fave retailer purchases.",5
"I noticed that someone wrote a review about how after washing her shirt, she hated it.  well, i have washed mine 2 or 3 times already and have never ironed it.  i do use fabric softener, and i take it out and hang it to dry after it has tossed in the dryer for about 5 minutes.  it is not meant to be a crisp dress shirt, but a soft casual shirt, and as i said before, i have not ironed it once.  it looks like it did when i bought it, even straight out of the dryer.  (i own the yellow and pink!)",5
"I expected this dress to be pretty, but was happily surprised at the level of beautiful detail. it's hard to tell in the pictures, but the dress has a black background with tan embroidery all over, and white embroidered eyelets. the full lining is bright blue and it peeks through the eyelets, with the slit on the back and the inside of the neckline lined in bright orange. the slit on the back has two buttons closing it - a really cute detail. it fit me comfortably (i am 5'7"" and 130 - got the si",5
"I don't usually write reviews, but i loved this dress in the store and would have passed it right over online. the skirt is a charcoal color and the top is an antique white. it gives the appearance of a separate crop top. i would usually wear a small (5'2"" and 125 lbs.). i'm wearing a small in the photo, but ended up going back for an xs. the dress could go more casual with flats or boots and a scarf, or dressier with heels and jewelry. i think i'll get a lot of use out of it.",5
"This is such a cute and flattering top. it isn't a style i would normally gravitate to, but i liked the color so i thought i'd try it on. i ended up trying on the medium because they were out of my usual large and it fits great. it drapes really nicely and looks super cute with jeans and booties. the little stripe of ladder lace around the middle is a bit see thru but not revealing. it's a nice top for transitioning from summer to fall.",5
Starts out crisp but not too tight. doesn't over-stretch through the course of the day. very comfortable but looks polished. front pockets sewn together like all verdugo jeans: good particularly because it eliminates the awkward brighter white where actual pockets would show through fabric on other white jeans. washes exceptionally well and holds its shape as well as softness; which is good because being white they pick up stains easily. be careful with underwear lines- thong probably best.,5
"I was looking for a holiday dress to wear to the nutcracker and what is more appropriate than a tulle skirt?! the tulle lays fairly flat so it's flattering rather than being poufy. the top is a thick material, but not quite sweater material. since the top is warmer, it should be fine for winter even with short sleeves (and a cute cardigan or furry coat#. i'm going to sparkle it up a bit with a necklace or belt, but it also looks fine without extra accessories. fits true to size, i'm typically a",5
"Anytime i see this brand at retailer in a button down, i have to buy it. fit is always so flattering, comfy and the prints are always great!",5
"Love this blouse in yellow! fit is true to size, and it looks a feels great.",5
This dress is so cute. i couldn't make it work because my long torso.,5
"Material is very soft and the cut is flattering. i got the yellow and pink. yellow is more of a brown color, but i still like it.",5
"I love love love these white jeans. the crop style is great as i am 5'1"", so the fit is perfect for an ankle jean.
these fit the bill in every way. they are so comfy!",5
"This is a dress worth paying full price for, based on the good construction and lacework. i got it for an office event, and although it is low-backed, the high neckline makes up for that! no jewelry necessary with the high collar. i am 5'10 and 135lbs, built like a column, so i got the 6. definitely not for full-figured women, unless you want it long. very cool orange lining and buttons on the back vent.",5
Very comfortable and cute. true to size. a look for three seasons.,5
"I have one in every color, that is how much i love them! i love that they zip on the side and are high waited. i am 5'4 and got a 4 and they hit me just right.",5
They're the same quality and fit as my hyphens from last year. easy purchase!,5
"Looking for the perfect camisole that smooths the flab, keeps you warm or cool as appropriate, doesn't ride up, and looks good? this is it! it takes a bit of extra effort to get this cami over your head and pulled down, but once you do, you say ""ahhh!"" it feels good and is a blessing--a seamless bit of control of middle-age, middle-body flab. for sizing: i wear a size 4 in most clothes, and in this cami, i can wear a small/medium or a medium/large. the former pulls in more, but the later gives m",5
"These are awesome! classic style and quality you'd expect from ag. the mid-rise is nice for moms like me that are not interested in low-rise jeans. tts. i'm 5'8"", 135# with a curvy bottom and wear a 29, which is my normal size in ag.",5
"I have purchased several pairs of these pants and love them. i got two pairs last fall, one in purple and one in red. i purchased a pair in sand this spring, and just purchased pairs in the violet and taupe last week. i purchased the violet to replace the purple pair i bought last year (stained them then first time i wore them). these pants are great, but the violet color doesn't quite match the color in the picture (which looks very similar to the pair i bought last year). in person, the violet",5
"Love these! so comfortable, feels like wearing pajama leggings! they're stretchy but don't lose their shape, and the fabric is super soft!",5
My experience with these have been great and the colors are even more beautiful in person! they're easy to dress up for work and going out and easy to dress down for hanging out on the weekends. i am typically a size 31-32 and 30's fit me like a glove. i also typically wear petite but don't like the just-above-the-ankle cut of these so i purchased them in regular and wear them as pants. i can un-cuff them with heals/wedges or keep the double cuff and they hit me perfectly as full-length pants wi,5
These chinos are the best.  the fit is always true to size. the quality is great and the new fall colors are beautiful. my favorite are the plum. these are my go-to pants,5
This is a beautiful dress! not too interested in yellow but needed it for a wedding this summer. i usually wear a large but returned it for a medium - the large armhole was a little too big. super comfortable and easy.,5
"Look closely and you will be surprised at this awesome print!  the shirt is very soft and comfy.  be warned that it runs huge.  i usually wear a medium or large in this brand.  after many tries, i ended up with a small and it is roomy.  this looks so cute under a jacket too.",5
"I purchased the violet chino's in my local store. the color to me is more plum than violet but a nice shade still. the fit was perfect and they are oh so comfortable. i bought size 27 (weight fluxes 116-118). i can see having several pairs of these in other colors because of the comfort level and they work for fall, spring and summer. in the warmer states even winter. the fabric has a soft feel to it.",5
Bought these pants for a long trip through south east asia. tried them on at home and instantly fell in love with the relaxed yet styled look. will be incredibly versatile on my trip which i need as i am bringing only ~15 pounds of luggage including the bag. they seem breathable and are light weight. super flattering as they are slightly slimming and don't bunch up at the waste. i got the greenish color.,5
"I bought these in pink and added taupe to my wardrobe because one pair is not enough. i found a tiny variation in size between my two pairs, but for the most part they are true to size. i love the just below the navel rise. they pair well with strappy or fringe sandals. i haven't worn them with boots yet, however i think they'll be great since they hug in close to the calf and ankle without being tight. buy them in the size you buy jeans or one waist size smaller if you're sometimes this or some",5
Fits well. true to size. love the kelly green color and found a blouse to match. the see-through part gives it some oomph and a little extra sexiness without being inappropriate for work. only downside is the beige color--kind of a funky bandaid-colored beige. but the blue and the green balance it out.,5
"These pants fit well, are cute, and are comfortable. they are a nice alternative to jeans.",5
I ordered 5 pair of these pants and the dye ran everywhere when i washed them according to instructions and then it came out with weird lines and splotches in the pants. i sent them back and retailer was very nice about replacing them. i have yet to wash my 2nd pair but we will see.,5
"This dress ran large--maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy. the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body, maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame. i loved the yellow color for summer--it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding. unfortunately, i had to return it.",1
"When i tried these on in the store i was thrilled - they were comfy as yoga pants and  the fit was divine. i thought i had found the perfect jeans and i splurged on them for my birthday. after wearing just two times they are baggy and the knees are totally bagged out, saggy and faded.
so disappointing - i want my $180 back!",1
"I loved this top! the cinched in waist is so flattering. or i'll leave it un-cinched for a super relaxed fit. it's comfortable and light weight so i'll be wearing this into late spring/ early summer. i've worn it with the green pilcro slim pants, i've worn it unbuttoned over a basic black knee length jersey dress, i've worn it over a bathing suit in west palm beach. i can't wait to find more fun ways to wear it!",5
As other reviewers have stated it is hard to see in the photos that the dress has iridescent blue/pink/lavender sequins. i was surprised as well but in a good way. i think it has a unique look and is so pretty and romantic. its a vision of shimmer when you are walking. if you have somewhat of a bust i would size up because the triangles run a little small. other than that its a beautiful dress.,5
"I would not have purchased this had i not seen it at my local (2 hrs away!) store. as the previous review mentioned, the red is gorgeous! very saturated color, just lovely. it does run large. i am 5'10"", 135lbs. i typically wear medium but chose small and could possibly have done xs but i wanted the extra length.",5
"I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price, but the design really spoke to me. i've been waiting for an off the shoulder piece that i love, and this was it. great, light fabric and beautiful design. i love it. worth every penny. can be worn on or off the shoulder like pictured.",5
The color is deep coral and perfect for fall to top jeans or leggings. i love the big slouchy look so the drapey quality is a plus.,5
"Love this sweater!  lightweight, comfy and does run large.   i usually wear a size 12 or l/xl in sweaters cause i don&#39;t like them to fit tight.  i read reviews and ordered a medium and it&#39;s perfect!  can&#39;t go wrong!  i ordered the red, but am now thinking of ordering the grey one!",5
"I really wished i had heeded the other reviews of this ""dress"". it is so ridiculously oversized i cannot imagine who this possibly would look good on. i ordered the sm/med and when i took it out of the package i thought i had accidentally been sent a bed sheet and said ""are you kidding me?!""  by the time you cinch the neckline so the fabric is somewhat close to your body the neckline is almost to your waist and you look 50 lbs heavier. horrible design retailer. i don't know which dress the",1
I was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress.  this was not it.  completely see through.  i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up.  but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip.  its an odd design. absolutely not worth the price.  i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress. returned this piece without looking back,1
"Such a great purchase! the fit is so flattering to my 5'3"" frame. i usually wear an extra small/small, but i opted for an extra small after reading a review; i'm glad i did. i also did not get the petite, but i imagine it would have a similar fit without the length this has. it flows, yet hits my curves in all the right places. i will say, i'm a c cup and if you have larger breasts, the extra small may not accommodate them as it is just right on me. the black is so slimming especially when pared",5
"I really love the fit of this classic scoop neck tee. i am 5'8"", 140 lbs, and 34 a/b. i am typically a size xs/s or 2/4 in all retailer tops. however, this brand (velvet) runs small. i had to order a size medium. the fit is slim to your body and is a little sexy with the low scoop neck! the fabric is very soft and a little thin. i am a little concerned how it is going to wash, it seems a little delicate. but i will wash it on the delicate cycle and line dry it. i ordered the black (classic",5
"I purchased this shirt in black. luckily, it was on sell. it can be dressed up or dressed down. it's so easy to just throw this on with skinny pants or jeans. i got it on sale too. i just hope that i can keep it for years since it will always be in style.",5
"I originally bought this tunic in black, and loved it so much i bought the rose as well. normally tunics make me look like a box, but the tie on this one makes it super flattering.",5
I was hesitant to get this piece but for the price i couldn't resist and i'm so glad i got it !! it is beautiful in person and can be worn so many  different ways.  it really makes you look slim too ! i got the size small and i am 5'4 and 130 lbs and it's a perfect fit !!,5
"I wore this dress to a couple different summer parties already, and i love it! it looks better belted on my curvy frame. i really like that the straps are adjustable and the versatility of this dress! 
perfect lightweight material in this summer heat. 
i'm not sure why reviews say its sheer- its not sheer at all! the fabric isn't hugging your body at all and you just need nude colored undergarments.",5
"I bought this top in black, and it fits my body type really well. it is probably one of my favorite purchases from retailer recently. the black top is really slimming and is a great cut. i usually have trouble finding tops that are long enough for me, but this top is definitely a great length.",5
"Soft and cozy, the orange is vibrant, the green is more subtle and has gray tones. usually wear a small, bought the xxs ! too full and too sloppy in the xs ad small.",5
"Top fiits true to size- i'm 5''6"", 132# and avg bra size. i orderd a 4 and it is great.i love the colors and the fabric is realy nice- what i would expect for this price point. the slit at the neck is not too low to be revealing. this would work well with jeans and just as well with dress pants for work.",5
"Great style and fit. will look great with jeans, skirt or leggings!",5
I got this in the teal and the color is beautiful and i get so many compliments! definitely size down. i am athletic and usually a m and i ordered a small.,5
Thus sweater is perfect. the fit is exactly as i expected it from other reviews. it is super soft and not at all itchy. i have worn it over a tank top with jeans and boots as well as to work over a dress. the fact that i can wash it is an added bonus. i haven't dried it yet as i am worried it could shrink. i bought this with a discount but it is totally worth full price.,5
This sweater is buttery soft and warm. it is long and you will want every color. i bought the sky blue and it looks fabulous with so many outfits. i had to get the gray color also. the sleeves are a soft fitted rib material and the body is long and roomy. love love!,5
"Love this cozy sweater for layering. i purchased the green, have the cream saved in my cart, and also love the coral and blue too. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, ordered size small which was perfect",5
"Eyelash sweaters are all so soft and cuddly but this is the only one i've found what doesn't make me look like a bear. the shoulder cut-outs really help create a   flattering silhouette. i'm 36-30-40 the medium fits well, slightly loose so the sleeve below the cut out hangs slightly. highly recommend.",5
"Love love love! it's the perfect cozy, comfy piece for a bitterly cold day. and the color is such a nice shade for the dreary winter.",5
"This gorgeous sky blue sweater was already in the dressing room to try on; i was not shopping for anything like this whatsoever. well, i tried it on and decided it was a must-buy. i usually need a petite in sweaters and coats, but this one, because i prefer a longer length, fits just fine, and the sleeves are not too long. the color is beautiful. it seems to be warm enough for sf evenings. it think the price is quite reasonable for a sweater/coat like this. a great purchase!",5
"I love this sweater! the sky color is very flattering in person. i love that it looks good open or closed. i bought one for my mom and me. i think it will be very versatile. i think it runs mostly true to size, possibly runs just slightly big.",5
Gorgeous suit! one of the most well made suits i've ever owned. sexy yet provides great coverage. do note the sizing is per australian standards. i had to order a size up.,5
"This is an amazing sweater. thick but not overly thick, the material is beautiful and the colors rich, i love the collar and the way it closes as well as the pockets and the back being different from the front. i hope it washes well. i bought the moss. it fits nicely and is very slimming. i highly recommend.",5
Cute sweater. snap was broken when i received it. and i looked for it at local stores and they are all out of stock. ugh!,1
Possibly my favorite retailer purchase ever! like wearing a cloud & fit perfectly! if you're busty - not sure about it -- but otherwise wow! told my husband: hope you like it because you'll be seeing it all the time & he not only agreed but wanted to know if they made pajamas for men.,5
This sweater coat is really cute and soft (i hate itchy sweaters). the blue is lovely and the cut is flattering. i'm going to check it out in other colors as well!,5
"I love this dress! it's cotton, but thicker/ higher quality. i'm going to wear it for nights out and to dinner this summer, and it's thicker material, so i won't even have to wear a bra with it ! it's a little lower cut, so be careful. i'm 5'3 and the extra small hits me right above my ankle",5
"I originally bought this in a petite xs. i am 5' 4"" tall on a good day. sometimes longer sweaters can overwhelm me. but the petite was almost a bit snug and short in the arms. i exchanged it for a regular xs and while i now have to cuff the sleeves, the overall look is much better. i bought the gray but really liked the blue and moss too. will be very nice for the frigid days we have in ohio. looks great with leggings tucked into boots i think. a winner!",5
So soft and comfy. looks equally good buttoned as open. can be worn as a tunic top over leggings or jeans. the charcoal color is chic and i liked the different patterns on back and front.,5
"Love it! can't wait for warmer weather to wear this sassy number!
i'm not sure what kind of bra to wear if any but it it fits so nicely around my bust line that it looks tasteful.",5
"I was leery when i ordered this as i read the reviews and i'm busty. it is perfect for me- just wear a little bandeau underneath! i'm 5"" 1 1/2"" ,135 lbs and 34d bra size. also the length is perfect. i'll be wearing this little number winter and summer here in fl. will look just as cute with boots and long sweater! and did i mention, it has pockets!!!!!!!",5
"I've never bought a jumpsuit and loved this online so i took the chance and ordered it. i'm 5'7 and 130lbs, i bought the small and it fits great. i love the plastic around the neckline to keep the top in place. the draping fabric on the chest is great for my small chest, gives the look of a fuller chest. absolutely love this. great buy and a great price!",5
I loved the contrast of the front panels and sleeves/back of this sweater. it has a coat look with the ease of a sweater. the arms seem very long and i wish i went with an xs as where i live not much laying is needed. but overall this is a lovely sweater!,5
"I saw this in the store and fell in love with it, i didn't buy it at first but i couldn't stop thinking about how comfortable it was so i went back and purchased it, its soft and very comfortable, im glad i went back for it.",5
"I love sweaters like this. it's perfect over a tank top for a casual every day look. it's soft, comfy, and i love the length. one more thing i like is that while it looks great just open, there is a snap to fasten it if you want to.",5
"I love the overall design of the top. the embroidery is very nice as well. i would agree with the past reviews that it runs large. i am between a small and medium, so i ordered the small.",5
"This cardigan is utterly gorgeous. way prettier on than i feared. my only issue is it felt a little itchy in the arms, and so i finally looked closely at the tag. the tag says the *back* section (which looks exactly like the weave on the arms) has a measly 5% wool snuck into the fabric content. why, retailer? why wool? i am so sensitive to it! my eyes have been demon red and itchy all day, classic symptoms that led to my getting rid of anything in my wardrobe with wool in it.

now i have a problem",5
"The other reviewers have already adequately praised this very attractive sweater, but i'd like to add that the sizing is large. i fit perfectly into a regular small, although regular medium is my usual size. i am 5/1"", 130#, 34f, size 8 top. the medium swamped me. the shoulders and sleeves were comical, and the body too big. i imagine many of you are scoping out this lovely, comfy piece; you'll want to hit the right size the first time. my store didn't get the coral, so i can't speak for that, b",5
"I am 5'4"" and the regular sweater i tried in the store was too long. i ordered the petite online and it is perfect! it's warm and comfortable and can be worn different ways which makes it great for stretching my wardrobe. love it!",5
"I was surprised at how soft this is. it also has snaps under each arm for definition, and on front for closure. didn't know that, and love it. got yesterday in mail, wore out last night. highly recommend.",5
Soft and cozy every day tee that can be dressed up or worn casually. only compliant is i wish it came in more colors!,5
"I love this romper! it has a retro look to it, is super soft, and has a whimsical retailer print. the  pink color is the perfect shade too. the fit is great and i had no problems getting it on or off.",5
"These pants are much cuter on than in the picture. i love the fit, snug legs and normal waist. will order again in another color.",5
"When i first tried on this romper, i grabbed a 6 (my normal size) but because of my bust size, i could not even get the top half to cover me at all. i decided to give this romper another go a month later, and tried on the 8...it made all the difference! i love it, it fits amazing, and it is just too cool.",5
"I ordered this in a size small for a pre-wedding brunch in dc in october. i am 5' 4"" and usually wear a m in dresses and a s in retailer tops. this dress is full and flowy, but the top is less generous if you are full-busted.. i am a 34 dd and the top of the dress is almost too small. i love it so much and it is so flattering and fun, so i decided to keep it. i can see wearing this on many more occasions.",5
"This is a great piece to add to your wardrobe! the flowy and light feel of the fabric is great. i got the pink, which surprised me because i wear so much black. the length fits longer than most rompers, which is great. it makes it a classic fit. i definitely recommend this and suggest trying a size up- the waist has elastic, but it's snug.",5
"Quite possibly, one of the most flattering, beautiful, and effortlessly romantic dresses i have ever tried on. and, to top it off, it has a sweet surprise: the silk slip on the inside of the dress has the same print as the outside shell, and it is so lovely, that if you feel like wearing something short and sweet, you can wear the slip as its own dress.

runs true to size, to maybe just a little bit big--if you have a smaller bustline and narrow hips, you might be able to size down.

it's cr",5
"I've been hesitant to try on rompers, in part because they seem complicated and i also too worry that i would look a bit like mutton disguised as lamb in one of them! however, i saw this romper and fell in love with the pattern and had to try it on! 
the pattern and color are wonderful, and i instantly felt glamorous, like betty grable in a cute cheesecake photograph! i had to buy it, and have since received tons of compliments on it (and i have yet to feel that i am too one foot in the grave t",5
These pants are perfect for crisp fall weather and comfortable! i wear them with flats to dress down or heels to dress up! recommended for all shapes!,5
"I got this dress on sale (under 20 dollars) but i would pay more!  it runs very large - i got a medium which is roomy, irl i wear a large (vanity sizing i suppose!).  the colors are so pretty, it is lined so you don't need a slip or cami.  highly recommend!",5
"Buy it. buy it right now! this dress is gorgeous, and would be on anyone. i don't care what size you are, it's so pretty, that you feel pretty in it! i loved wearing it, and since i am in florida, i can wear it all year long. so it's worth it. happy, very happy, with this purchase!",5
"After multiple purchase and returns (from other sites!) i decided to splurge on a dress for my college graduation (located beach side). this dress was better than i could have hoped. the fit is very flattering, loose & tight in all the right places. the adjustable straps underneath the overlay ensure the silk lays perfectly. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light as a feather. the slight train & back buttons adds elegance to an otherwise ""casual"" floral pattern. i would highly recommend",5
"Love this romper! once on, feels comfy like pjs but looks put together. i find bending forward at the waist helps to get it off and on. tiny complaint is that the top snap shows, even when closed. that is minor. the rest is all good.",5
I absolutely love these pants. they are so incredibly comfortable and fit is amazing! they look awesome with sandals and boots and will transition perfectly into fall. i definitely recommend sizing down like the other reviewers have suggested. i originally purchased my normal size 27 but they were loose after wearing a little around the house. i decided to exchange them for a 26 and they were a little snug at first but stretched out and fit perfect!,5
"Needed a pair of grey pants to go with some of my jewel colored tops.
hei hei is my favorite brand of pants and these did not disappoint.  they fit like a glove and are true to size.  i don't think the picture does them justice.  if you like comfort you certainly will not go wrong with these pants.  you can wear them year round except in the heat of the summer.  i would not hesitate to purchase them.",5
"I picked these up the other day looking for a good jeans alternative. i love them. they are the perfect fit of slim but not skinny. i went with my normal size (26) and so far after one wear, they are still in good shape. a little bit of stretch, but not too much. the moss color is so crisp and goes with a lot. they will be perfect for transitioning into fall.",5
"A fun, casual romper. i loved the pink color (not usually my thing), which looks great with darker skin. like another reviewer said, the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes (i took a size 6 in this, but am usually a 2/4) - this will make the top part a bit blousy, but i think that adds to the appeal/ look.",5
"Love this quirky romper. i'm normally a m/l or 10/12 and took a large in this. as the other reviews stated, it's a bit of a contortion act to get into and out of this but when in it fits well, is flattering and oh so cute.",5
"Really, this top feels like a wonderfully expensive soft silk knit. it is just so very soft. the drape is really nice and there is stretch to it, making it very comfortable. it does have a tendency to fall towards the body, even though it's loose. so, i'd buy your regular size.

it's a thin material, but i don't think it's sheer at all. i bought the dark red/wine color and it's so classy! i love it. this will fit taller women easily because the arms and total length are on the long side (i sup",5
"I really love this pair of fitted cargos. i'm 5""1, 103 pounds and bought a 25p since that what i take in most jeans at retailer. it is quite fitted like it shows on the model so some may prefer to size down for a comfortable fit. i bought the grey color and is a lovely neutral color. love these and may have to go for another color!",5
This dress is timeless. so cute on and fits easily. i like that it has long sleeves yet it is a light fabric. comfortable and stylish. that is for me! i am taking it this weekend to nyc for a trip. i think i will fit right in!,5
"This romper is fabulous! i bought it in lime, and the color is great and perfect for summer. i do agree with the other reviewers that it's hard to get in and out of the sleeves (hence giving it only 4 starts for quality#, but the struggle is worth it. the fabric is lightweight and silky, so it feels cool and soft; it feels like wearing pjs. it's also very flattering with the bow just at the waist; it hides a not-so-flat tummy. i'm 5'4"", between 135 and 140, and curvy #very busty specifically), a",5
"This is a beautiful coat. no one has mentioned how beautifully the pattern matches, even across the arms coordinating with the front. i love the lower button as it allows for arm movement and contributes to the casual slouch. the only complaint i have is there is a slight dark spot above both pockets. this appears to be a sewer's mark for placement. i think i have figured out how to disguise it without marring the fabric; but second item from retailer with marks (quality control?). i am keeping th",5
I tried this top on before it went on sale but thought the price was too high. as soon as it went on sale i scooped it up and i'm glad i did. i'm usually always a small in retailer tops and this was no exception. i'm tall and thin with a large bust but this top does not pull or bind in the chest because it's cut on the bias. it is a little low but i've been wearing it for parties. it might be too low for work depending on the setting. i don't usually wear green but this is a very muted and pretty,5
"I loved the dress, but just not dressy enough after rethinking what i needed. very easy order and return. thanks!",1
"This shirt drapes beautifully. forgiving fabric in a beautiful taupe. it is a bit low cut, i wear a camisole underneath. true to size.",5
The green color is beautiful. i love the cut and material - it feels luxurious. definitely needs ironing before wear but is a must have,5
"I'm in love, i'm in love, and i don't care who knows it. i bought this vest on a whim and i'm so glad i did. it's so soft and cozy. the medium brown color makes it highly versatile as well. i've tried the faux fur vests and they are too bulky for my taste, but this was not bulky at all. warm and hangs well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame and the small was just right. try this vest on...i promise you will be in love!",5
"Not usually one for a turtleneck, even a mock turtleneck, but this so soft and did not fit super tight around the neck so i bought it. then i bought the other one because i loved it so much. my only gripe is that i wish it was a smidge longer. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic build, 34c and the small fit perfect.",5
Love this coat! beautiful pattern and thick enough to keep you warm with a lining inside. i am short so i got the petite and it fits perfectly in the arms and overall length. i read other comments about the button being too low but i didn't find this to be true. i liked the lower button as it allows you to show some of what you have underneath.,5
"This top is lightweight and flows nice. i usually take a medium or large. i ordered a medium and it is slightly large. so if you are between sizes, i would go down. i will keep the medium because it isn't the type of blouse that should hug your body. the green is stunning.",5
"The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester. 

also, this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.

i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.",1
"I bought the bronze color which was nice but the cut just hung like a dust rag, no fit , no drape
very unfinished looking. though i bought it on sale on sale, it is not worth keeping. over all it was not a worthwhile blouse to keep.",1
"Saw this skirt online and ordered immediately!
it is even more beautiful in person.
stunning hemline and a gorgeous shade of teal!
i ordered my usual size and it fits to perfection.....very very true to size.",5
"While i do love this sweater, it did not fit me as is pictured. the wrap does not lay as smooth and i had to adjust frequently when transitioning from a sitting to standing position. nice weight.",5
"This coat is super yummy! i'm always in need of something stylish and warm at the same time. definitely was happy with the weight and lining on this garment.

*highlight: i always get compliments on it when i'm out.",5
"Don't be fooled by the image; unless you have a c/d chest, this romper has masses of draped fabric right around your middle--exactly where you want it least! very unflattering and rather expensive for the poor quality. back it goes!",1
"I don't ever do ruffles - i'm a 36ddd - but these laid so nicely and the vertical ruffle is very flattering for a less than flat tummy. the knit back is so soft and makes this easy to wear. it will be easy to dress up with a necklace, blazer and dressy pants but it will go just as nicely on it's on with jeans for a casual look. if there had been the mint color in my size, i would have gotten it too!",5
"Love this coat. it fits very well - i'm 5'6"" and typically wear an 8. it is a bit broad in the shoulders like the other reviewers mention, but that's part of its tailored look. this gorgeous coat breaks up any boring winter outfit. so happy with this purchase.",5
"This blouse is a great combination of silky and professional in the front and more casual, t-shirt like in the back. the ruffle lies nicely, and it's very feminine. i got the light blue color, and can't wait for the weather to be warm enough to wear this to work!",5
The shirt cuts too high up and is very awkward looking on. sent it back. wouldn't buy even on sale.,1
"I have had my eye on this coat for a while and then my size (0) was sold out. when it popped back i ordered it. i am 5'4"" and i had wondered if i needed the petite (petite 0 was sold out) because of all the reviews i had read. however, the sleeve length is perfect. in a petite, the sleeves would be too short. i don't have long arms so i am surprised some reviewers have complained about the sleeves being too long. the button placement is not at the waist but that is the style! the lapels are long",5
"I wanted this coat from the first moment i saw it in the catalogue. i tend to gravitate toward dark colors, but this looked timeless and beautiful, like something my grandmother would have cherished (and i would have coveted). i was not disappointed. the coat is carefully lined, and the mohair is divinely soft. the silhouette is not fitted, but comes off surprisingly chic. do note that this is not a coat for heavy duty weather; i've even been a bit chilly wearing it at nights in la. also, heed t",5
"I purchased the green in xs and it fits perfect. it's very flattering. also, i purchased the blue in xxsp (only size available), but it was too short.",5
I usually pass on ruffles but this top is great! luckily i walked by this in the store and had to try it on. the material is very soft and can easily be converted from work to a night out. the v-neck is flattering and the ruffles lay nicely- i purchased this in the taupe but the green is beautiful too and will purchase it as well.,5
"Shirtdresses are a warm weather favorite for me, and this one will surely make its way into my regular rotation. the outer cotton eyelet is intricate and beautiful. the color, cornflower blue, is endlessly flattering for many complexions. the cut is classic with the twist of the handkerchief hemline, and the length is work appropriate. per a previous reviewer, i sized up to ensure a fit across the bust and am glad i did. overall, the fit is not totally perfect on me, but it's still great and gar",5
"I got this top on a fantastic deal - it is comfortable, fits well (slightly large to size, but i prefer that), and really on-trend. such a great staple i bought in the other colorway as well.",5
"This vest kept catching my eye online. i was ordering moth cashmere cowlneck sweater, (which is fabulous,) when i noticed pictures posted of women wearing both the vest & sweater. the more i looked at these pictures, the more i fell in love with the vest. needless to say, i purchased the vest in my usual size xs which fits tts. it's incredibly soft & a great piece to add to your wardrobe!",5
"This coat is spectacular. it was love at first sight but it was only after trying it on in a store that i decided i really wanted it, even at the full price. the design is unique and gorgeous, you don't see coats like this on the street, not a cookie-cutter. it's very soft, yet warm, and has a gorgeous ochre colored lining making it very easy to put on and a standout when a bit of the lining is revealed.
it seems the fit is what most reviewers complain about and i can see that. i tried size 2 (",5
"Google ""mr burns see my vest"". because that's me wearing this vest, dancing around the house singing because this vest is wonderful. my three year old nephew declared it ""cozy"" and anytime i wear it he cuddles up to the vest. bonus! it's flattering, comfortable, warm, machine washable, and goes with nearly everything. i would like a onesie made of this material.",5
"I received this coat today and i'm ecstatic about my purchase. i am a true petite, and the petite large in this coat fit perfectly. i was a little worried about the sizing based on the other reviews. yes, the button is low, but that is the style. i strongly suggest ordering a petite if you are short. otherwise, the fit may be completely off.",5
"I love this top which gives you the look of a blouse but the ease of a t-shirt! the sky blue color is spectacular. the details of this top are beautiful and very flattering! i am tall at 5'8"" and it was plenty long enough. i ordered my typical size s and it was perfect. it is cut to follow the lines of the body. i can't wait until the spring so i can wear it! it would be great if it was available in more colors.",5
Really unattractive shirt. nothing good i can say about it. horrible fit. i can't imagine this would look good on anyone.,1
Super soft fabric! the opening in the back makes it very chic.,5
"This is even cuter in person than it is in the picture. it was hanging on a rack by the dressing room, so i tried it on on a whim and loved it! so, so soft too! runs true to size. i am 5'2 and 125 and got a small.",5
"I fell in love with this top the minute i saw it, best of all, i was not disappointed when i tried it on. the fabric is soft and looks classy, the color is a rich and deep emerald green and the quality is really nice. you can dress it up or down depending on the occasion, this top will look gorgeous with a nice pair of jeans or a dressy skirt. true to size :)",5
I just love this blouse! it fits well and is really feminine and pretty. i paired it with a skirt and received lots of compliments!,5
"This windowpane coat is so striking -- and it looks even better on than in the photos. i love it!! it has great styling, including the button placement & the beautiful fall brown lining. it is quite warm over a thin sweater, the fabric is amazingly soft. i get a lot of compliments on it! two friends have already purchased it. i normally might take a 12, but a 10 was just fine. this is a great coat!!",5
I love these jeans! i really like the way they fit and haven't had problems with them stretching out like other reviewers have.,5
Best jeans! fit is amazing! buy them; you won't regret it!,5
"The smocking is beautiful. the fabric is soft and flowy, it is not too sheer for work. the blouse fits tts. i have this in 3 colors and take the xs and have even bought the xxs. for reference, i am a 32 b.5'8"" and 110lbs. it is a nice layering length and is not boxy. the armholes fit nicely. i wish they still had the blue.",5
"The perfect pair. i am 5'6"". 130lb, and ordered size 28, and it fits just right. it is a little stretchy, so molds to your shape. the legs are slender, but not too fitted. no stitching along the seems makes these jeans classy enough to work with a dressy shirt.",5
"Love these jeans, fit and style... the wash is a makes them almost more navy blue than blue jean color... but they are soft and fit perfectly. another reviewer described them as mid rise, but they don't fit me that way at all",5
"These were fabulous and a great color in person - true to a normal ag fit. i am 5'1"" and the regular size was too long so i am exchanging them for the petite version in the same size. really hoping they fit the same as the regular version!",5
I was so lucky to find these jeans in store yesterday and they are the most comfortable jeans i've ever had. the fit is amazing and wish they weren't sold out online or i would buy more!,5
"I am 6'2"" and athletically built, and i usually have issues with dresses being long enough for me, but this beauty has the perfect fit and perfect length. it is very flattering. the weight of the dress allows it to move with you. it is form-fitting, but loose at the same time, so your body doesn't look lost in the material. you can dress it up with heels, or wear it with boots or sandals to be a bit more casual.",5
"This is one of the best tops i've ordered. it fits well, it can be worn dressy or casual. what is pictured is what you get. if you are considering this top, it can be worn all year round! the price is not outrageous, and the quality seems it could last for more than one season.",5
Take a look at this dress in person or on instagram. the model photos on this website make it look washed out and bridal. irl the lace is a gorgeous ivory tone that looks great casual and dressed up. i'll be wearing this with leather and denim! i chose the smallest of my size range and it fits very comfortably. if you are busty you may want to size up. i am 135# 36c 38/27/35 and i bought size 8.,5
"I just tried these jeans on out of the box and they fit like a dream! i'm 5'0' 100lbs and the 25petite (my usual size) fit me exactly right as full-length skinny jeans. they taper perfectly. no hemming required. they are super comfy and nice and thick. they feel durable and high quality.

two suggestions for improvement: 1) i wish is that they were a uniform dark blue wash (but the fadng and whiskering is barely noticeable). 2) i also wish they'd place the butt pockets a little higher, especia",5
Great spring colors that you really can wear just about any time of year with the right foot wear! the fabric is a fluid jersey that drapes well. the neck line is a substantial scoop which is very flattering. i am very happy with this online purchase!,5
"I did not even pause over this dress on line - a white lace dress now? well, my local retailer at lenox atlanta - which has a petites department - had this dress in the window with a jean jacket. being a lace geek, i went in to find it. i am a big fan of the feminine and dressy, dressed down. great window display idea!

this picture does not ""do anything"" for the dress except wash out the true color. the lining is ivory - that vintage sepia photo look ivory. the lace is lovely ivory too, and the",5
"Love these pilcro jeans, my usual size fit nice like skinny jeans. i know if i had gone down a size they would look too tight in the legs, they are not supposed to be leggings. they did not stretch out too much all day - slightly in the waist, not enough to size down. the dark color is perfect for winter! they are very comfortable!! love pilcro jeans!",5
"They fit over my fatty belly and make my legs look good. comfy. nice and not cheezy with a bunch of 'look'. more than i would normally pay, but i like them.",5
"It's amazing!

i did size down on this one, but i didn't have to. that depends on the kind of fit you are looking for. sizing down did make the shirt more form fitting in my chest area, but also did make the garment somewhat less comfortable in the armpit area for being tighter (but not too tight). my normal size would have alleviated this problem, but also would have left the shirt with not a whole lot of shape. i opted to have a little shape and deal with the fabric slightly digging into my",5
"This cute dress has a built in slip, so no need for a slip . i think it has a flattering fit and the colors are pretty!
i feel like i could wear this dress to a shower, out to dinner, or just for a fun look to shop on a nice day!",5
"Just buy this dress! the slip, the hem, the print. everything about it!!",5
"Best dress ever maeve does it again! tts and can be worn all 3 seasons here in sacramento 
love it and can be worn with a denim jacket or cardigan!",5
"Such a cute dress, i ordered the black version. i'm large busted (dd) and the slip thankfully fit (sometimes it doesn't). i'm 5' 4"" and went ahead with the regular, not petite, version and i have to say i think the petite would have been too short. the dress comes to the top of my knees as photographed on the model. highly recommend.",5
"Saw this in the catalog and had to have it.  i paid full price!   while the buttons aren't functional, it is not too revealing.  i work in a casual office and it will be perfectly appropriate especially paired with a jean jacket!   the length is right above knee.  i am 5'6"" 122# and went with the xs",5
"Can dress it up or down and still look good in it! i wear leggings under it to keep my legs warm since the material is thin and i live near the ocean. this is my new standard summer dress! i bought an xxs since i am petite weighing 95lbs and stand 5'1""",5
This tshirt hits at a great length not too long. so it doesn't make me feel top heavy! but it flows enough to hide any imperfections !   i ordered a medium.,5
I just received this dress after ordering it online and i'm already in love. the fit is perfect - i tend to have issues with bust areas of dresses being too small and this fits just right. the material is light and perfect for southwest florida.,5
Absolutely love everything about this dress!!! i'm 5'9 138lbs purchased a small. hits just slightly above the knee... has a fun flow to it! absolutely love the chest detail! cute buttons! and the embroidered detail is amazing!,5
"So cute! i get tons of compliments whenever i wear it. very comfortable. i ordered a petite l and it's a little big. i usually buy the petite m, but due to the under slip i wasn't sure.",5
"This dress is wonderful! word to the wise, it says that you can machine wash the dress on cold, which i did. the dress came out fine, but the slip is now basically a shirt. there are no washing instructions on the slip, but i assumed it would be the same. it is not. it still looks ok under the top part, but i will have to wear a half slip under the bottom.",5
This is a great dress!  very different and light but cute details,5
"Love this dress! bodice and lace at bottom gives is a cute layered look. there are buttons on the front (see pic), but it does not button up. i'm a bit on the ""hippy"" side....physically hippy, that is...and this dress did a great job of downplaying my hips. ;) i'm 5'4"" and this dress hit just above my knees (a bit longer than on the model in the photo). would look cute with a jean or military jacket! i am wearing a small. 5'4"", 130lbs, 32b chest.",5
The cut is perfect and the rose color is so pretty!  it fits like the typical left of center sizing.  i wish it came in more colors!,5
I love this shirt so i bought both colors. i wish they had more colors! fits great and very comfy.,5
I adore this top! it's comfortable and cute. the sleeve length is great for wearing bracelets. it's well-made. just perfect.,5
"This dress is my new favorite! the style is trendy and feminine while forgiving in the tummy area without looking maternity or too baggy. it is so versatile because it can be dressed up or down and it's a great transitional dress b/c once it cools down, it will look great with a denim jacket, cardi, booties, etc. i normally wear a m, sometimes a l (i'm 5'7"", 36dd) but the m fits great. the slip is a little snug across the chest but i definitely couldn't size up b/c then the dress would be too bi",5
"Citizens of humanity jeans are excellent!!! i prefer high rise & this brand is my favorite. i like the clean lines & plain design. the material is comfortable- substantial with just enough stretch in the material which makes them super comfortable. i'm not constantly pulling these jeans up, they hold their shape really well & wash well too. they run tts.",5
"Could not wait to try this on when it arrived, jumpers are tricky in the way they can ride up and become unflattering. not the case here, i usually wear a size 8 but i decided to order a size down for a size 6. i am 5'5 and 150 lb. being the fact that i am in the midst of losing weight i thought i would rather it be more snug and this really was just right. the pockets make it casual and cute, while the print and bare shoulder make it fresh and chic. you will love!",5
"There aren't enough great words to describe this dress. tried on the black one in store yesterday and knew immediately i was going to purchase.  everything is perfection - not tight slip underneath that even has the strap snap closures to hold it in place at the shoulders, not too low cut, hits right above knee so not too short, light weight, flattering, etc!!  and machine washable! can dress up or down. could even wear to work with a jacket or cardi. can wear all seasons - can't wait to pair wi",5
"Great pop of color (i purchased the rosy color) and great piece you can add layers to. it drapes beautifully, may run a tad larger, but not enough to size down. light weight, so wear alone for warmer fall days or as we get into spring, and with a scarf and jacket for cooler days.",5
"I purchased the mauve dress from an retailer store last weekend during their 20% off sale. i absolutely can not say enough great things about this dress. it fits beautifully... the pattern on the material is so pretty and feminine. once i got home from the store and tried the dress on again, i immediately purchased the black one also. i had to have it in black too! such a great dress to wear to parties, date night, friends outings.. we are going to california in september and will be wearing these",5
"This is a great dress from moving to summer into fall. it's great right now with the warm temps, but a throw on a jacket and some booties and you have a fall outfit. it's very comfortable also. there is a slip underneath which is what you see with the buttons open in the front. i wish the slip was a little longer and the dress is see through. maybe, you can adjust it at the straps some. at any rate, it's a nice dress and i'm keeping it.",5
"Just as the others have reviewed, i agree! this dress is flowy and so feminine. i got it today and i am wearing it now! so light! i usually wear a large or a 12 in dresses. i am pear shaped. 36b bust and large hips. it is flattering and feels great on. the slip underneath fits perfect on me. grab this before it becomes iso!",5
"I caught a sneak peak of this beautiful dress on a local retailer instagram page...and i was so excited when it arrived at my store. i love this dress! i went with the black because i loved how bold it was. it's ultra feminine and flowy. the slip underneath has the prettiest embroidered print and the overlay is light and airy. the bottom is hemmed with a little lace peekaboo and it is wonderful. i tried this on in both a l and an xl. the xl fit well but the dress was a little long on top, so i wen",5
"The print, layers and fit of this dress remind me of the 1990's but in a good way! the outer dress is voluminous and flowy, so i understand why some reviewers feel the dress runs large. the embroidered slip is tts and quite the cherry on top. i really appreciate that styling detail. 140# 36dd 5'3"" and i chose medium regular length, not petite since i'm older and wanted the length.",5
"Thin for this late in the season, but the colors are so pretty. i'm going to layer it over a long sleeve t, top with a cardi and pair with leggings. runs large. love the the unconnected slip. 5 stars.",5
"Got this dress in the mail today, and it's definitely a keeper. the material is high quality, and i can see wearing this dress on all but the coldest days of winter. it'll be great to wear today in 90 degree weather, and with a cardigan and booties, it will easily transition into cool weather. the colors, patterns, and lace are all just beautiful. for reference, i always order xs for loose fitting dresses, and a size 4 for close fitting styles. the xs in this dress is perfect.",5
"I started buying maeve dresses about five years ago and love every last one that i own! this one is no exception. i bought it in black last week (size s) for my birthday treat, and it was so wonderfully light during the week of 99 f heat in the district. it's feminine and delicate in appearance, yet the material is of good quality and super comfortable. it's awesome, just a perfect summer and probably fall dress.",5
"I must be the lone dissenter, but i am in love with this piece! a dark cami underneath really make the eyelet pop. i probably would not have liked it if it did not have the clasp, as it does run wide. however, with skinny jeans or slim pants, this works b/c it's loose in the right ways. it may not be for everyone, but it's one of my faves right now.",5
"The essence of femininity. simply beautiful. if you begin with the pattern of the dress, you become drawn to it. then, as you look closer and see the slip with its creamy detailed embroidery, and immediately you see how the dress opens at the bodice with tiny, set buttons, you soon realize, that's not all... the bottom of this fine piece of art continues with soft, delicate, chiffon trim with a bonus layer of the most beautiful lace to finish it off. i bought it on sight and just love it. i was",5
"This is a must have for summer. i'm always hot but sometimes a sweater just doesn't look right. the short sleeves are just what i've been looking for. every jacket i own runs smaller on me around the bust and arms, so i think for everyone else, your normal jacket size should be perfect.",5
I bought these pants to wear while riding on the back of my husbands motorcycle. i wanted something that was more chic than typical motorcycle women's clothing and these were perfect. they block the wind but are stretchy on the back side so they are super comfortable to wear all day. i also wear these to work on fridays! i bought a size 28 and they fit great. i usually wear a 6 in us sizing.,5
I ordered this dress in two colors and i'm happy that i did!  very cute and great fit!  flattering too!,5
"Love this top for work. loose, flattering and enough detail to be noticed. fits tts and goes with everything.",5
"Bought this in the white in the store - came home and ordered the blue - wish they had my size in the orange.
maybe this is enough said? this is so comfortable, so well made, so easy to wear - might be the perfect dress ever.",5
"Absolutely love this dress!! this was my first purchase from this site and as per the usual, i was worried about the sizing but the fit couldn't be better. definitely won't be the last. material is heavenly and has a double layering that was a nice surprise. very warm and soft. high quality stuff. i could have gotten my usual size in petite, but i didn't want it to be too short. i'm glad i did. this is the perfect dress for work.",5
"This dress is everything i hoped it would be. it is soft and comfortable, and flattering even though it's not tight fitting. true to size as well.",5
I initially walked right by these pants when i saw them on the rack. then i saw them on the fitting room attendant. they looked amazing . i ended up purchasing them and i love them . the great thing about them is the the leather is only in the front which makes it great for moving around and sitting down (the back is kinda legging like). i had to size down in these.,5
"I think this is a really flattering dress. i like the length of the sleeves (they're not long like in retailer's very first navy photo but all the other pics are accurate in my opinion.) in my photo, i'm wearing an xs regular so i'd say it's shorter than 35"" because i'm only 5'3"" and it's above my knee. it may run slightly small because i'm a 34aa, with a 26"" waist, 34"" hips and usually wear xspetite in retailer but this xs fits me fine (although to get it to be fitted at the waist, xxs might be bet",5
I absolutely love the look and fit of these pants. what is even better is that they don't stretch out while wearing them. i will get a lot of use out of them!,5
"These are such a great alternative to actual leather pants, they have the perfect amount of stretch and breath-ability (i've always found leather pants to be too hot) . got the holly color, unfortunately the p size was sold out but as another reviewer noted, these are easy to roll up. i noticed some of the complaints about quality and these not holding up, but given the use of two different materials, pu and a stretchy material, i think it's only natural that these would tear along the seams aft",5
Love the versatility of the dress. very easy to dress either up or down. i've been able to wear it out for a casual day with a denim jacket and booties (just like the stock photo!) or even wear it to work with a black jacket and flats. the color is beautiful and the material is very soft and comfortable. absolutely love the cut and design of the dress on top. only thing i would mention is that the dress is a bit form fitting than expected. it definitely hugs your curves.,5
"I bought this dress for a dinner after my daughter's wedding rehearsal. it is perfect. it is dressy enough for the occasion. it also has a casual look to it. i think it is very versatile. i fell in love with the colors, material and the quality. i am more excited about this dress then the dress i am wearing to the wedding. buy it you'll love it.",5
"I'm so happy i decided to order this dress! i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and normally buy xs petite, but the comments said the dress is a little short so i went with a xs regular in navy. i am glad i did -- it hits me about 2-3 inches above the knee. the material is very soft and seems well constructed. a bit thicker than your average summer dress but i like that! very flattering overall, and for the price it's a great steal!",5
"I bought this dress in ivory and then bought the navy on sale, i loved it so much. i'm 5'4"", 117, and the petite medium was perfect. love the kicky flare, and the lining makes it so comfortable. an effortless, fun dress - perfect for hot summer lunch.",5
They are very comfortable and have kept their shape after a couple of wearings. the pants can be used for informal or on the dressier side. the spandex in them is contributes to the comfort.,5
"I bought the navy color in xs petite. i'm 5'1, 115 w/ athletic build. i thought the fit was perfectly fine. with a belt, the dress is about 3 inches above my knee. the dress is made very soft/breathable fabric and has a ""slip"" underneath.  bonus: the dress is made in the usa! i'll be buying the white and red once they're marked down a bit more. very satisfied with this dress.",5
"I purchased the navy size small and was delighted with the fit. the waist line is perfectly proportioned for a petite. i think this means that the waist line will be high on a woman who needs regular sizing. i like the lining, it adds a substantial look to the dress.",5
"I loved these pants the minute i put them on, and was so happy i'd ordered them. but i wore them only 3 times - and only at dinners with friends, not even for full days - and the seams on both legs ripped open! i think the faux leather just isn't equipped to handle the stretch of fitted leggings. i was super-bummed about this, because these pants are so insanely cute. but if they can't hold up to a few casual wears, then there's just no way... thankfully retailer was true to their brilliant custom",1
"Very beautiful sheath dress that will be perfect for summer weddings and spring events because of the delicious sorbet pallette.  it's a substantial weight fabric that will nip you in and give the illusion of curves where none exist (in a good way.).  pattern is actually knit into the fabric not printed.  size 8p is the smaller of my size range so for others who are slender on top may want to size down.  if you have prominent hips, stay tts or size up.  if you are very busty, it's tts or size up",5
I love these pants. i have them in the black and green. they are comfortable and look great on my curvy figure. i am 5'2 120lbs and got the size 27,5
Fits true to size with good coverage. stayed put when i was in the pool.,5
"I said this ran large because i bought a 16 and i normally need a size 18 (i'm busty) if the item doesn't stretch. but, a size 16 fit me. it's more straight and less blousy, but it does fit. so, if you like your tops a little less full of fabric and more tailored but loose, imho you can size down.

the fabric is rayon/polyester that's light and cool. it is semi-sheer but a white bra or nude bra would be fine. the top has a double layer in front. one solid and the over-lay of the embroidery. th",5
"I bought this today in navy and loved it the second i put it on. it feels great on, is well made and flattering! you can wear it anywhere and look pulled together. much cuter in real life too. it does run a little small. id go up a size if you're getting the white so it won't cling too much.",5
Received these in the green holly color (beautiful color) for christmas,5
"I have thicker thighs and don't usually find that i can wear this kind of thing. these, on the other hand, are hot, hot, hot and are even somehow slimming for my thighs. i just adore them. i'm waiting for the green color to go on sale so i can buy them too!",5
Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!,5
I have this top in 3 colors and am waiting for the black to arrive. very soft on the body. we live in fl so lightweight is appreciated. stylish fit that is not ordinary. great colors. will pack well and can be dressed up with a scarf. sleeves run long.,5
Love this top! i bought it in 2 colors; it's a great twist on a basic tee. love love love!,5
"I am 5'0"", 109lbs, 32d, and the 0 petite fit tts. the fabric is comfortable and the dress well made. my only complaint would be that the picture of the model and the dress i have in my possession do not have the same coloured slip. my dress arrived with a nude slip. i was a little confused at first but when i tried on the dress i realized it was not a bad thing. the lace actually stands out. all in all, a greal buy. discounts make it worth it too.",5
"These jeans look amazing on! hug every curve in just the right way....the long length with flare...add a platform heel and i look like i have legs for days!! and my booty will definitely turn some heads! total splurge but for a great pair of jeans, totally worth it. ordered my usual size 27 and they fit like a dream. hope they don't stretch out after wearing a few hours. the amount of stretch feels nice, so i think they'll continue to hug your body. if you want 1 pair of flares in your wardrobe.",5
I love the crisscross detail that makes this a stylish and also flattering piece. lovely soft material that drapes well and hides imperfections. wish it came in more colors!,5
"I fell in love with this dress but when i received it in the mail, i was really surprised to see that unlike the picture online, the slip underneath is a nude color. it fit well and i decided to keep it. i wore it for the first time today and felt great in it. i was driving with my son in the back seat, i turned to hand him something and the entire right side of the dress (where the crocheting is) ripped open!! i cannot believe how poor the quality is at this price!",1
"This is the perfect tank. it's super soft, great colors and with a shape that allows you to wear a regular bra. best of all, it was offered in petitie sizes. for me that means i finally have a tank that doesn't gap at the arms or scoop too low or flood me with excess length. thank you retailer for remembering us petitie girls with this wonderful tank!",5
These tanks are very soft. i have two black and one coral. i had to return the white as it was see through. they do shrink in the wash even without drying all the way and on low heat so maybe size up if you're in between sizes. i recommend these tanks for sure,5
"Love the cut of this t-shirt. just loose enough but not big and boxy like so many other tees but not fitted either. nice weight, the hemline is interesting...overall happy with it. just hope it doesn't shrink!",5
"I was surprised to find this jacket on sale and i don't mind :) it's a trend of the season and i absolutely don't mind to look like a mattress or wear robe. the garment runs large so i wear usually 6 and have to get xs. i am 5'6"" 146 lbs usually wear s/m in jackets. it hits me 2 inches below my knee. i love it.",5
"But when i saw this top in person, urged by my stylist when they got it in, i decided to try it on. they had xs in store, my former normal size (xs or xsp). that was too big though. not being sure how the petite would look, and not sure if smaller would work, i decided to order all three: xxs, xsp and xxsp!

verdict on size: xxsp was pulling at the arm holes, kind of small there. xxs regular was almost right, but arm holes were a little high, not as comfortable.
xsp ended up being the right c",5
"First problem-i would not have ordered this at all had the description been correct. the fabric description is cotton which the dress is most certainly not. secondly, it has a really funky, cheap, unfinished, raw-hemmed slip which is simply not fitting for the dress. the keyhole in the front is super long-again, does not seem to fit the dress. i am not happy with this piece at all but it did fit tts. length is just above knee. i am 5'5"" 142 lbs 34d and the six was a good fit. sending this home t",1
"These shirts are fantastic; lightweight sleeves for summer wear. i go back and forth between xs and small, (i have broad shoulders) and ordered one of each. i like both. the shirt has give so the xs is fine but the variation in size gives the two shirts very different looks.

the color is fantastic and true to the photos! not always the case with online purchasing so i loved that.",5
"Really cute sweater, well made, but so intensely itchy i couldn't keep it on for more than 30 seconds !",1
"Great, comfy shirt! long enough that i can wear it with leggings!",5
This shirt is such a beautiful color! the lavender is a really lovely addition to spring wardrobe and goes with more than imagined. it has a bit of an oversized fit although it falls really nicely on slimmer silhouettes. it's also incredibly comfy and stylish with an updated look even to the most casual of attire.,5
I received this top yesterday and love it! sexy yet not too revealing and great for date night! i like the way it fits across the chest and isn't too short in the waist. very soft fabric.,5
I wanted to like this one.. really but it was just plain sloppy looking. i returned it.,1
Got this in the pretty springy blue already wore it with white jeans and loved it!! love the loose longer swingy style and i can't wait to wear again! i may have to get another color!,5
"I own this tank in three different colors, and have been wearing them since the weather warmed up! they are soft, good quality, and wash up well. i've taken them on vacation as they take up no room in my suitcase, and also have used them as little camisole shirts. they don't fit too tight on, just right. i think you could also use them with pajama bottoms to sleep in.",5
"Adorable summer top. the geometrical shape makes this top interesting. it looks much better on then in the picture displayed. it's soft , flowing and covers all flaws. the gold color is beautiful and vibrant. i know i will purchase this in other colors. the long back really sets it off. if you are looking for comfort, don't hesitate, this top is perfect.",5
This top is semi fitted and then stretches as you wear it. i love the design and color choices.,5
Loved this skirt. it reminded me of the styles that i saw visiting paris this past summer.,5
"This tee is so comfortable and stylish. you can easily dress it up. i love how the back covers your assets, and the sleeves are long enough for tall girls. a great buy on sale! i bought a small and bought 3 colors!",5
"Bought these jeans after reading others reviews and was not disapointed. these are the most flatering jeans! they give you legs for days, while providing amazing shape. oh and did i mention their soft as butter. huge win for me as jeans are one of the most difficult items for me to my as my waist is 1-2 sized smaller than my hips and thes stretch marvilously to fit your body. they are on the pricier side and well worth it.",5
Great with leggings and skinny jeans! it's comfortable too!,5
"Fantastic quality. i agree the material is heavier and may be too hot for summer in sc but will be perfect for ac cooled offices. the fit is tts. i am smaller on top than the bottom and size 2 fit well everywhere thanks to the somewhat stretchy material, 32-24-36. i never write reviews but this dress really is fantastic and at a great price point given the high quality of the fabric and design. i couldn't tell from the pics but the back bottom is not a single center slit but a double slit. i rea",5
"I saw this in the store and purchased it right on the spot (didn't even see the reviews until now). i can wear either a small or x-small in retailer but for this top, the x-small was a better fit as it draped nicely and was still very loose on me (i'm 5'4, 125 lbs, 34b). i was worried that the opening was too wide but it was perfect. i like the elbow length sleeves and the fact that the blouse is lined which mean it's not sheer and don't have to wear a camisole. i usually stick with the classics i",5
"This looks nothing like it does on the website. it runs small and the colors are so muddy. it doesn't drape nicely and i a musually an xs and this was short, stiff and plain ugly. sent it back immediately.",1
"Love this top and i think it is a great transition piece - i live in texas, so our temps stay high until october. this top in the purple motif color is perfect, since the colors aren't look too summery, but the fabric is lightweight. this top is a little bit boxy, but drapes nicely so it won't make you look wide. as with most holding horses tops, this runs a little big so size down unless you need the length.",5
"Love this top for casual days. fits perfectly, fabric feels quality and color is bright but not too bright. good length, just touches top of my thighs.",5
"I absolutely love this top, it washed up nicely and is perfect for body style. short waist nice soft colors. i ordered another top that is this style. perfect first time i wore it i received so many compliments.",5
"I love this shirt's color which is a lovely yellow. the fit is nice and flowing. i usually wear xs but intentionally bought s, so that it would be a little lose and i may wear with leggings. my one issue is how transparent it is. i opt to wear a spaghetti strap underneath it, however some women might be ok wearing it alone.",5
"I fell in love with this blouse the minute i saw it in the store. the colors are a little deeper than how they appear in the catalog, but the greens and browns are beautiful and will be great for fall! it fit very true to size, i usually wear 8-10, and the m fit perfect. the gold beading on the sleeves and neck are a nice extra! love this top!!",5
"These pants fit me perfectly..i am 5'7"" and 134 (most days).. and wore a 4..they are so comfortable, i could sleep in them. they do stretch a little after wearing (linen), which can be a good thing to some...they are a heavier linen so good for mild winters..almost look denim..if they came in more colors i would get more!they also remind me of my old hippie days, which was fun",5
"I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on, i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss. 
people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean.",5
"This is such a beautiful shirt! for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34b) it is a very detailed and tailored shirt so i can understand if your busty why you may have to size up. the attention to detail along with the embroidered butterflies sets this shirt a step above average. the color is an odd shade of olive but i like it and the butterflies have areas that you can see through but not in an im-modest way. i do not feel the need to wear anything under it.",5
Fits really nicely and i'm picky about sleeves but these are just right. a little see through but i don't have to wear anything under it because the seams and piecing cover well. love the fit not too blousy in the waist and the assymetrical hem is nice.,5
"Would not have picked this out online, but it caught my eye in the store. the blue color is gorgeous, it's a flattering style that drapes well and will pair with just about any short, jean, capri or summer weight pant and a number of chic accessories. you will not be disappointed!",5
"I've been shopping at retailer since 2007, and floreat used to be my favorite designer, but for the past year or more, floreat mostly misses the mark. this blouse looks nothing like it does on the model. 
1. it is long on her, not so in real life. this is probably the worst part about this blouse. if it were not for this, i might try on a size m and give it another chance.
2. it runs very large. i usually take a l or xl. i think i would need a m in this, as mentioned above.
3. in the picture, t",1
"A great casual top for warm weather - the linen ensures its structure stands out, and the structure gives it more interest than a plan tee. does a fine job of hiding minor midsection lumpiness. can be dressed up a bit if worn with linen or cotton trousers. i bought the yellow and was pleased to find it wasn't too transparent. i bought the small and found it tts for an american small (bigger than a uk or european small). a versatile keeper.",5
I have to agree with previous reviewers in that it is a bit short on the top but i kind of like that as i am petite and most tops come way too long on me; however go up a size if you have any breasts at all. likely they will not fit in you standard size. however i just love this shirt. soooo adorable. the color is a bit more olive than brown to me though than what is in the pic :),5
This shirt is so comfortable and looks very nice with jeans or work pants. it's a great shirt!,5
"It's always sunny when i wear this sunshine yellow tee.  love the color and they way it was pieced together.  has a flattering feminine fit whole still feeling relaxed and casual.  it's slightly sheer but not obscene.  all linen and a little scratchy so if you're sensitive, be aware.  i purchased medium and i'm 39/28/35 140# 5'3""",5
"I agree with the other reviewers, this top is completely disappointing in every way, i could not believe it was the same top i pulled from the bag. where to begin,.......
it runs really big
it's short and boxy, not at all like it appears on the model, this must be pinned a lot in this picture.
colors are completely dull in person, i really think this picture was lightened a great deal.
fabric feels cheap and stiff
lining is stuff and poorly sewn.
i haven't one positive thing to say about t",1
"The style, plaid colors & cotton fabric really appealed to me in the pics. looks like it will be very cool & airy for these brutal hot days. ordered both the blue & purple in the size 6 for length. did not disappoint at all! looks pretty much on me as in the pic. a little surprise is that both tops have a thin metallic pinstripe spaced abt 3-4"" thruout the plaid. it's a silver metallic on the blue, & raspberry on the purple plaid. not obvious from far away but noticeable up close. a cute feature",5
"As other reviewers have said ~ the colors are more muted but good fall colors! quality top with lining and bead detail on hem and sleeves. flowy, loose fit ~ very cute with skinny jeans and booties. i would size down if you are small chested. great boho top.",5
"Great color and fabric! a bit on the sheer side but not completely see-through. perfect for spring, summer and even into fall. wore it on a weekend trip to the beach with capris and then to work with a cropped blazer. planning on ordering it in additional colors if it's still available. a good staple for your wardrobe!",5
"I ordered this top in xsp and xs. i don't think i let the xsp top breathe long enough, because i thought it was too short and sent it back. (there is no retailer near me...) i kept the xs, and at first thought the same thing about it not fitting right, but by the end of the day it stretched just enough, and felt just right. really pretty top. i received a lot of compliments on it.",5
Really cute over my white cropped pilcro jeans. or as a beach cover up over a bathing suit. i want this in more colors!,5
This skirt is stunning but i really wish it was cotton canvas - maybe by summer retailer could make one?,5
"Great, really soft hoodie. i got an xxs petite and it's still a little big, but it works. i'm 5'1"", 95lbs.",5
"This dress is fantastic. super flattering and unique. i get a compliment every time i wear it. i encourage retailer to source more dresses from this brand/designer. lovely. i am picky and nevery give a perfect rating, this dress got all 5 stars.",5
I love this tee. very soft and easy care. gentle cycle hand to dry.,5
"This wool jacket actually feels more as a cardigan, its a little too thin for a jacket but looks about the same as pictured. its very pretty. i ordered a l and it was true to size. sleeves are cropped. the wool material is surprisingly soft and comfortable. very nice and colorful addition to my closet. recommend! :)",5
"I bought one of these tees for myself and one as a gift -- both in green, which is really a beautiful dark teal color (as pictured). the fabric is so soft that the gift recipient said she wanted ""an entire jumpsuit made of this fabric."" :) the shirt is long enough, loose enough and substantial enough to wear untucked, as pictured, but lightweight enough to tuck in to a pencil skirt. i am usually an xs or an s in tops, and i ordered the s in this one. the larger size gives the slightly loose fit",5
"I saw these in the connecticut retailer but didn't want to pay full price. the very next week, they went on sale! i ordered xs (i'm 5'4, small frame, 120lbs). while the length is perfect, the waist is a bit tight for pjs. though, not tight enough to return as i love everything else about these. they're like wearing a painting of fine art! light weight flannel. hope they hold up well iin cold water wash!",5
I just purchased this amazing jacket in the moss color in my regular size small (34d-27-35) at the store because my husband had commented about how cool it looked and i absolutely love it. this is the softest jacket ever and you wouldn't even know it's not real leather. the moss is more of a cross between a dark grey and green and it's so neat how it goes with so many outfits. the moss green does not make it difficult at all to match up with so many other colors like you would think due to it's,5
"I'm super into this top! i bought the evergreen color in store as it fit true to size and was very flattering. i went to buy an item that was available online only and decided to also buy this top in black. my favorite aspect about this shirt is that it can be dressed up or down. the material is slightly stretchy though it does not cling. i can wear a chunky necklace and dressy skinny pants and look ready for a nice dinner. on the other hand, this top can be thrown on with a pair of comfy jeans",5
"This dress is amazing quality with stunning details. its flowy and absolutely beautiful.
i plan on wearing it whilst im in the depths of the mongolian mountains while singing operatic arias.
i ordered a size two regular, even though i am petite for the sole purpose of dress length.
---->in the picture, the dress comes down to an awkward length on the model, the sleeves are 3/4 and it doesnt look as good as it could if the length settled down to where their ankles are, or if the sleeves reache",5
"I was looking for something to wear for an event at an art gallery. i actually really loved this dress! i think it hides body flaws. i tired on the xs, but the small was a little more flowing. it was comfortable and very fun to wear.. i am short, so the length was great for me i wore a different full length black slip under it which was more comfortable for me. go try it on too see if it fits for your body style. it was great for me",5
"I wasn't sure the shorter length in the back was working until i tried it on. this jacket totally worked for me. the brown color can be easily matched with other colors. i got the jacket in medium size. i usually in between size. the medium size allow more space on the chest area, however the sleeve becomes a bit too long for me.",5
This top is so cute it's my go to top. dress up or down looks really cute with skinny skirt. i have the ivory and just ordered the dark grey. one great thing this top has pockets. i would buy this in many colors if i could. yes it's full but a cute full. but i love full tops. i think this is true to size it's not tight and i don't think it would be as cute tight. i actually like mine on me better than the one on the model.lol washes like a dream and you can dry it in the dryer.,5
"I got the red- it is a great color. this is one of those thin soft t shirts. it drapes really nicely and dresses up or dresses down. the only downside for me is that it takes a little extra effort in the washing department, but really not much- just have to line dry.",5
"I saw this in my local retailer, and was blown away by how soft it was! the minute i tried it on, i didn't want to take it off. for being a boxy cut, it was surprisingly flattering. i have a large chest and normally wear an xl in retailer clothes, but i could easily zip the size large all the way up. this is the perfect hoodie to wear running errands on the weekend, or with a pretty blouse on under it at work. i know i'll get a ton of use out of it, so i recommend it!",5
"I purchased this sock in another print before and wear them all the time. i was happy to see a new pair on the website and purchased them again! these liner socks actually stay on my feet... others brands i've tried before slip off my heel, but these stay hidden and stay put. plus a fun design!",5
"This dress is not flattering. the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy. like the other reviewer said, its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through. it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it didn't help regardless. the length is not accurate either. i would say it's a pretty short dress (mid thigh) but that probably depends on the person. it also makes you look very horizontal. i was really excited about this dress but it's getting r",1
"Another winner for me! this top drapes wonderfully, the lace is beautiful and looks fabulous on! i would highly recommend it!",5
So cheerful and colorful! love these cozy pj pants!,5
Excited to get this sweater! i'm a 38c and usually wear a size 14 blouse so i ordered an xl as i don't like clingy sweaters. this was perfect; fitted but not tight. i'll be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date. wish i could've gotten it for the 25% off + free s/h but glad i didn't wait - this size was sold out first.,5
"I fist saw this dress in the window in alexandria, va olde towne and i immediately said that i have to have it. upon receiving it in the mail, i was surprised by the quality of the dress. this dress is made very well. after trying it on it did look like i was going to be dancing with the hippies in woodstock. but i love the dress and plan on wearing it soon. good quality",5
"My skirt arrived this week and its beautiful! i'm so happy i splurged on it. i'm usually a size 6 and the medium fits perfect, although it is quite long (i'm 5'2"" though;). i will probably get it hemmed, but went ahead and wore it anyway and actually found i like it a bit long and its very comfortable. the fabric is very high quality and the color is stunning.",5
Large and the material is too bulky. i returned it.,1
"This dress looks like it could be cute on but when you put it on its just blah. i saw someone else trying it on in the fitting room and she felt the same. not cute, not flattering, the model photo is deceiving. would not recommend, although it looks airy and comfy.",1
"Just received this beautiful jacket of quality wool and superior design. i love it and wore it christmas eve with tailored black pants. the fit is perfect in the shoulders, sleeve length and generous in the hips, waist. i used the tie to gather it in a bit at the waist, but plan to have an inch or so taken in on either side at the hip to avoid my looking too wide. a matter of preference, but i have most things tailored--a must at my age! i felt young and attractive rather than old and non-descri",5
"I'm in love with this jumpsuit! i'm 39 y/old, 5.5"", 140lbs and ordered the 6 petite (my legs are a little challenged in the length department). it fits perfectly, and i get complimented every time i wear it. simple, yet elegant and stylish.",5
"George venson of vousta has designed a pair of pajama bottoms that are beautifully designed & comfy to lounge & sleep in. they are a light weight flannel that fit true to size & wash extremely well. the design on these pj's are like no other; a white background with red birds. polar bears, deer, all with tree branches running through the length of the pant. they're just delightful. you must try them!",5
"I'm a petite girl, 5' and 100lbs. ordered regular size xs since others mentioned this being ""short"" or ""cropped"". this sweater is adorable, not itchy in my opinion, and the lenght is just right, not short, not long, however it may be a bit short for tall girls...still think it's worth a try.",5
"I really love this dress! the fit is flattering and comfortable. the fabric has a pale art nouveau background, with indian and middle eastern prints over it. the beadwork does ""really pop,"" and the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. for lovers of etro's bohemian style who don't want to spent thousands of dollars on a dress . . .",5
"I'll start by saying, over the years, i get more and more frustrated by the lowered quality of retailer's products. this dress represents all of my frustration. cheap, cheap cheap material. low thread count. elastic!!! around the end of the sleeves that rubs the cheap fabric against your arm. i mean, this dress is a total disaster - and looks nothing like the photograph shown.",1
"When i first put this dress on, i immediately thought...oh no, i can't pull this off. at least, not without a cow to milk. but this dress is so comfortable. the material feels divine and the quality really is excellent for the price. the pattern of the panel on the bodice creates a slimming effect so it is also very flattering if you can get the waist to hit right. (i had to try on a few different bras to make this happen.) fits true to size. i got a size 2 - my usual size and i have gained a fe",5
"I was a little  hesitant to order it.  i am glad i did, it is a great top.",5
"I love the patterns and the colors! easy to dress up or down.  i ordered a small and just ordered a can to compare them. the cut is great as the sides still meet even though there's no closure. it's a good weight for this weather and winter! i live in sweater coats where i am and this is a great addition.
it's a little itchy, that's the only flaw.",5
"Absolutely perfect and worth every penny! i am 5'8"" and normally between a 4 and 6 in jackets. while the small fit, i ended up purchasing a medium so i had more room in the arms. insanely comfortable and truly stunning on. expect compliments when you are wearing it!",5
"I agree with almost everything the previous reviewer said with one notable exception: probably because she and i have very different figures, i am able to wear the sweater fully snapped with the belt cinching my waist creating a peplum effect. i wore this jacket to a party as a top over a black band aid skirt (code for tight-fitting and tastefully short) with black semi-opaque tights and black booties. the look was classy, but edgy having paired a delicate floral pattern and unusually feminine n",5
"I loved this on the cover of the august catalog. when i saw the pictures online, i was a bit hesitant because the background of the dress looked white, and i wondered whether it would be too washed out for me. not so. i love it! it fits beautifully; the waistline is very flattering. it looks like a dress a model would wear in the 1960s -- not a hippie, but a model in a high fashion magazine. it looks great with boots. the fabric is soft to the touch, so luxurious. i am of polish and lithuanian d",5
"I love the fabric and details of this dress!! i was thrilled to see it in person. i plan on wearing it when the weather gets colder because of the styling of the dress. i am choosing to keep the hem where it is, and thus prefer it as a ""colder months"" dress. the poppy flowers really ""pop"" in this dress- love!!",5
"Absolutely beautiful jacket...the craftsmanship is amazing, and the colors remind me of a impressionist water color. the jacket runs true to size (i'm 5'7"" and 115 pounds with a 30e bust and the extra small fit perfectly). unlike the other reviewers, i didn't have issue with the bottom not lying flat or the collar bunching up. i wore it with a green leather pencil skirt and suede stilettos, but you can also wear it with skinny jeans as well.i got this very deeply discounted, and although it is i",5
"This is just as it looks. a minimalist, elegant, dark navy skirt that provides a classic feminine shape and looks like it could last for years. it is straight, so you might want to consider sizing up unless you're quite slender. i'm 5'10"" and 160 and am sending back a m for a l. excited to get my new skirt and to wear it.",5
"I didn't have a problem anticipating the fit of this dress. i felt with the drawstrings on each side i could make it work. i usually take a large and even ordered a medium as i had read all the reviews of it running big. when i got the dress, i was beyond disappointed. it is a heavy, itchy polyester-like fabric, not a thin rayon looking texture like the picture shows. it is also a deep black, not the plum color in 4/5 photos. but most importantly, i am 5'8"" and the dress is very short on me. it'",1
"The previous review by beardedlady said it best: ""yes, i do still feel like a little girl playing dress up in it but i don't care. this is a fun, creative dress to be worn on the days when you feel like having a julie andrews moment."" 


in my own opinion, i don't think i can wear this without a topper covering the poufy shoulders so i'm happy that i own the dara moto jacket in plum to toughen up the look. i am 38-27-35/36c/135# and the bodice feels a little loose all over with the size 10 re",5
"I had my eye on this jacket (in moss) for awhile. i was afraid the vegan leather wouldn't feel natural or soft but i was wrong. it's wonderfully soft - so much so that every time i wear it and tell someone it's vegan leather, they feel compelled to touch it and can't get over the quality. the detailing is great and the back adds a special, interesting touch. it's become my go-to jacket and works just as well with jeans as it does with a nice dress. and who doesn't love getting a compliment every",5
"This jacket feels like quality and has beautiful detailing. one thing to note though, the proportions are a little odd - it is cut very high in the back (at the waist) and the sleeves seem over-long.",5
"Soft, elegant, beautiful and makes me feel special! what more could one ask for? fit is true to size and has various styling options. best retailer purchase in some time.",5
"Great wardrobe staple! at 119, i ordered the s and the fit was great. you can wear this so many ways and it's soft!",5
This vest is the best!! even though it has no sleeves it truly keeps you warm. it feels like you're wearing a soft blanket around you. it is my favorite!,5
"One word: obsessed. feel like a carrie bradshaw bohemian queen. sturdy and luxurious, pretty fancy, definitely queen-worthy. i&amp;amp;#39;m walzing around my house in this dress listening to john mayer and feeling fab",5
"I wore this blazer for one day, didn't do anything strenuous, and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back, next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable, since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.

as to the fit, it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it, so it's good over something cute.

or, it would be, if it didn't fall apart.",1
"I saw this romper online and knew i needed it as i love flannels and i love rompers. it's super comfy. i bought with the intention of wearing it out, not just around the house. i think in the fall it will be cute with high socks and boots but as i just got it, i've been opting for tights. lots of compliments so far. i got a small because i didn't want it to be too short, it fits well.",5
"I meant to order both red and blue and added to red in my basket by accident, oops, meant to be? the color is very nice, not too bright holiday red, but nice rich red. the cut is very flattering too. i didn't expect to love it as much on. i ordered the xxs p, length was not too high/cropped, perfect. the asymmetrical hem gives some visual interest to the sweater, so does the fun neckline with keyhole on the side... fun take on a sweater... for me, the fabric was comfortable. i am 115 lbs, 30dd,",5
"I saw this online and was pleased they had it in blue at the store. the blue is more of a gray, but it's a great color. i tried on the small and my daughter said ""you look pretty, mommy."" i was sold! i love the cascade on the side.",5
"I absolutely love these shorts. i do, however feel they run on the large side. i am 5'1"" and normally wear a 24, 25, 0 or 00 and bought these in an xs. i would have gotten an xxs if they were available, but that was not an option. they are a little baggy, but they are so great i could not pass them up. these are too good to pass on.",5
"This sweater is perfect for cool days.  the fit is true to size, though a bit longer than in the photos, especially the sleeves (i'm petite).  i actually liked the length so did not order petite.  the sweater is a relatively soft cotton blend.  it is comfortable and the ruffle adds just the right amount of finesse.  the ruffle is stitched on all the way, so it doesn't open in front, which is a plus.  the blue grey is marled and more grey than blue.  the red is beautiful and as pictured.",5
"This is a very well made top, i like the cut and it fits true to size. very nice quality and the colors schemes are unique. i'm happy with this purchase.",5
"Loved the look of this shirt online. i tried it on and was sad to see that the frontal view is all wrong. the cool shoulder design is almost too exaggerated (almost looks as if i'm ready for take off!). unfortunately, none of the featured photos on the product page display the frontal view of the model. i really wish the shoulder design was slightly smaller in shape and size - i would have loved it! looks great from the side but sadly i can't walk around like that ;)",1
"This looks just as good in person as it does online.   true to size.  definitely warm, but not too heavy.  comfortable as well.",5
"These are gorgeous and not too short or too long which is oddly hard to find! they're mostly tts, but if you're between sizes i'd go up a size because the small was slightly snug on me and i'm a 4/6. i'm hopeful that they'll stretch a little with wear because i think the medium would be too loose.",5
"I bought this sweater on sale and love it. it's very sweet, comfortable, and unique. it fits true to size.",5
This is an adorable top. i purchased both the green and the blue. the colors and look are so much nicer than the photos of it. this is a stock up item.,5
"I truly feel guilty wearing these outdoors. it is incredibly comfortable, so much so that i asked the sales girl if these were pjs or actually worn out. i'm usually between a s and m. both fit fine, but i went with the m to have a bit more room and allow the top to be a bit more ""flannel"" flowy. the top has enough length that i can actually let it droop over the waist bet a bit. the length is definitely upper thigh on me (5'8"" @ 145), but rest assured, nothing is hanging out. it's actually the p",5
"I first saw this online and was worried the design might look awkward in real life...not on a model, but tired it on in store and it looks great!  it has a tighter fit and seems to flair out in just the right place.  just the right thickness, not too thin or thick.  i am 5'6"", 124lb, 34b and got the xs.  i did not try on the s for comparison as i thought the xs fit great.  i'm always either an xs or s with retailer tops. blue is definitely more steel. interesting piece! will not disappointed!",5
"This is cute! i was hesitant to buy, but glad i did. it has a unique cut. the fit is tighter to the body, but it's very flattering. i purchased a xxs petite in the blue color. the blue seems more on the gray side to me, but it is mottled and really pretty. the neckline comes all the way up - as shown. the detail on the neckline and the ruffle shown at a bias is really cool. i love it. pair it with a skirt or jeans. adorable!",5
"This is the softest flannel ever! while i don't think i'd wear it outside, it is super comfy just lounging around. it runs very large, but since it's a flannel romper, not a problem. absolutely recommend for all shapes and sizes!",5
"I am very particular about jeans. it's not just the look; it;s the feel and the quality of the fabric that won me over. the mid-rise wide-leg crop is perfection. i'm 5'7"" and a size 8. these are extremely flattering and versatile to go casual or incorporate into a more professional feel. great way to show off some of the fabulous fall footwear options as well. i highly recommend.",5
"Very comfortable, fit over my muscle-y and flabby arms! very pretty.",5
"These are great pants! i sized up from my typical size 28 because i found the rise to be a little low for me. i tend to like my pants a little higher on my waist. the sa said these ran a little smaller for most. when i got home, i put them up to my size 28's and they were the same. (what woman likes to go up a size?) i purchased the black;great for work and play. i would like the holly too but i am waiting.",5
Love this dress! ?? i tried it on at the store and loved how it felt on. i put it on hold to think about it and returned later that day to purchase. i am glad i did. the 1st day i wore it i received numerous compliments!,5
"This is the one. the faux fur i have been looking for. it is plush and heavy so that it should keep me warm and toasty during the dreaded new england winter. i love the richly saturated jewel tones over a base of black . there are only two snaps to close the front but there is enough fabric to overlap to keep the cold away. maybe winter won't be so bad after all....
one caveat is that the item description is not truly accurate.
i initially ordered a petite since the length stated was almost 37 i",5
This top is gorgeous dress it up for work or wear with jeans for a more casual look. the top fits true to size and the lace is not overdone . i would recommend this and can't wait to wear it.,5
"This dress embodies the retailer brand. the design is unique, and form fitting for just about any body type. beautiful saturated colors and a great cut make it an all around classic. i wish for more of these designs. i originally ordered my usual size 4, but went down to a 2. this dress runs large. looks great with heels or boots as pictured. i am 5'6"" 134 lb. this dress has a timeless quality that you will wear for years to come. at my age, i try to buy things that i will wear for many sea",5
"Adorable, true to size and just as pictured. there is no hook and eye clasp as stated but still cute. light weight and will be perfect over dresses and summer tanks. wish there were additional colors. i love the white though.",5
"Can easily be worn with boots or sandals - multi season dress. comfortable, flattering cut. slightly roomy, but pretty true to size.",5
"The fabric is beautiful.  didn't wrinkle so much after 8 hours in a suitcase.  as opposed to the other reviewer mine arrived neatly, stripes match nicely.  i am kind of thick waisted and the size 6 was still perfect for me - i am currently 130 lbs, 34-28-35.  love the colors and the fabric, a nice cotton twill, lined, pockets, pretty bow belt.  i am not a fan of the size zipper style but it is not a deal breaker.  glad i have them !!",5
"These pants fit the bill! they're soft and very comfortable. easy to wear day and night. these are a little higher on the waist, which i love. purchased two pair! i purchased the regular and they come to my ankles.",5
"Love these crops. fitted through hips with full legs. at 5'7 and 125, the 27 fit perfect. these look great with block heels and wedges. denim is lightweight, perfect for fall.",5
Bought this blouse in white. fits great. can be worn with many things. dressed up or down.,5
My daughter had one and wore it with everything.i ended up getting one myself.it is a perfect weight.,5
"Bought these over the weekend and i am in love! they are very soft, extremely flattering, and the rich green color is fantastic. i may go back for the black. i went with my usual size 28 for reference, and the fit is great. these will be a fall staple, for sure!",5
"These are amazing. so comfortable, true to size (i usually wear a 29 in pilcro and ag and bought these in a 29). i have curvy thighs and a smaller waist but didn't get a gap situation with these. the only issue i have is the length. i'm 5'6"" and wish they were a tiny bit shorter. they hit right at the top of my foot so i keep debating if i should cuff them or not, since the length looks more flattering cuffed but then the actual cuff looks a little weird. i bought them in black for work, and now",5
Can't love this dress enough. i have to force myself not to wear too often. i get stopped every single time i wear it to get complimented. i'm usually a size 6 or 8 in dresses. went with the 8 after trying both on. i found the arms fit better with the 8. i'm pretty athletic and 5'5' around 140 lbs.,5
"I love this sweater, it's so soft, and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it. it runs true to size, but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more, it seems to stretch a little. overall, i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it!",5
"I have a love affair with pilcro and these jeans make my heart throb. i've been stalking these jeans online and tried them on in the store yesterday. i'm 5'9"", curvy, and was concerned that they would make my legs look like tree trunks swathed in denim with miniature cartoon feet protruding from below the hem. not so. they fit like a glove, rested perfectly at my lower calf, hugged around the hips and waist, and flared without looking like church bells. seriously, if you're a cropped pants fan,",5
"But tight around the chest, i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area, kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else. green color is classic, and the back is longer than the front. overall flattering if with the right outfit. i'm 30 dd and 115 lbs for reference.",5
"This sweater is just as pictured. the fit is true to size, though it is a looser style rather than fitted sweater. it is short, though not cropped, and the sleeves are 1-2"" too long, but it is still flattering. it hits at the top of my hip and it looks great with high-waisted flares. the scallop detail is perfect, just enough interest, but not overbearing. the material is soft and heavier than expected. it is a good weight for fall. i wish it was made of natural fibers instead of synthetics, but",5
Love these new jeans. they fit perfect and are extremely flattering. they look great with a crop style top and flats!,5
"I liked this bc it is long, ivory and thin. i think it will be a versatile piece to wear with tees & casual dresses. it has a little hook & button closure up on one shoulder if you wish to wear it more as a wrap. looks cute that way too.",5
I bought this top in the black color and it's great! the lace sleeves are so soft- not itchy at all and it is very flattering.,5
"These pants are so flattering, comfortable, and silky smooth. a versatile fall staple for sure. i bought my usual 28 and they fit perfectly.",5
"Oh my this is the best cardigan ever. quality is superb and so soft. i am between a 12 and 14 so i ordered the xl, this cardigan fits true to size. will order more if more colors become available.",5
"I really like this dress! i wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered it, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits well and it's very cute and different.",5
Purchased as a gift for someone who needs to up her pj ante -- soft cute fun,5
"I love everything about this dress. the coloring, fabric and flow of it. it's so much better in person than on-line. it's true to size and very comfortable. a great price as well.",5
"These pants were pretty different then my typical style, but i love them! they come down a bit longer then i think they are supposed to because i have shorter legs, but i still think they are cute- especially with a heel or clog. good quality, well made.",5
My title says it all. this coat is sure to turn heads everywhere you go. the colors in the coat are beautiful jewel tones and differnt then you will see anywhere. it is so soft and warm and makes me feel fabulous. i feel it fits tts i am short and the regular lent was fine on me. get this before it's gone.,5
"Online this jacket is supposedly an online exclusive, but i saw it in green at my local store. i had to try it on and i loved it. it does swing but is not to much fabric. the drape is really nice it is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it sort of shows that on the model but is much more noticeable in person. this jacket is not lined and i would say more of a shirt. this is perfect for spring or cooler summer nights or over a tank or short sleeve in the winter. i also love lyocell it j",5
"I ordered this shirt online in green, size small. i am 5'4"" and 120 lbs.

i love the earthy color combined with feminine lace... unique, comfy, gorgeous!",5
"I just love everything about these jeans, and everyone that sees them on me seems to as well! i'm short (5'2"") and was concerned about the length on me because they didn't have the petite in my size- but these seem to be just fine. i wear them with a bit of a heel, so that helps. they fit snugly (but not too tight) in all the right places, i have a bit of a backside so that's a plus for me! because of the higher waist, they also don't ride down.  except for the shorter length, they remind me a l",5
"These pants are so perfect, i bought 3 pairs. perfect for casual friday's, a night out or the weekend.",5
"This dress is gorgeous in color and print; i think it can be styled as eclectic or elegant as you'd like. definitely runs big in the shoulder/bodice area, so i sized down.",5
"This top is beautiful on. i did not find it to be sheer in either the black or the ivory, of which i tried both on. i purchased the black as it was more stunning. i am a medium and it fit absolutely perfect. it has a nice pleat in the front, in case you have a teeny bit of tummy. i found it to be very flattering and will wear it as a date top. it will look awesome with skinny jeans or ponte ankle leggings. the body fabric is a lighter cotton. i am 5'4"" and it hits at hip length. it does not have",5
These jeans are adorable!  i wear a 10p and the 30 petite fit perfectly. great quality and will look cute with a boxy crop top and flats.,5
"I wanted a dress that made me feel pretty while traveling, when we went out in the evening. nothing really fancy but nice. i saw this right when it came out and the colors and cut were exactly what i was looking for. i am 5' 3"", and normally a size 6 in retailer dresses, but i have a dd34 chest and a little broader ribcage, even though my shoulders and hips are small , which can be tricky. the fit and flare style helps a lot but only if the torso is not too tight. i went back and forth over the si",5
"This dress is seriously gorgeous, and even more so in person. the cut at the bottom is so flattering for curvy , pear shaped, and hourglass shaped women. i sized down so that the dress gave me more of a waist than you can see on the model and it was so much more flattering. love the fabric, fit and style of this dress.",5
"You do not want to know how many cropped, wide-leg jeans i've tried on. all the rest make me look ridiculous for various reasons....it's not easy to get this style right, apparently. these are great: comfy, make my legs look cute, not chopped off, they are not mysteriously tight in the upper thigh (why do some do that?) they act like trousers with a jean's casual edge. the ""let out"" hem is super cute and they are soft and comfortable. perfect with tucked in or shorter blouse styles.

i bought",5
"These pants are so great. i was debating between them and some sateen denim style pants from another store, but these definitely take the cake. the fit is awesome--although i am a 26 in the green and a 27 in the black, so that's kind of weird.",5
"Fun transitional dress for fall that can be worn with ballet flats, boots or booties. true to size. for reference i am 5'9, 138 with an athletic build.",5
"Love these! loose and comfy everywhere. delighted to have found a 32, and delighted that they are roomy, even at the waist. i exchanged another pair of pilcro's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict, but as usual, retailer customer service was excellent. earlier sale price was honored, easy returns in the orignal shipping bag.. 
retailer design, fashion and company attitude excels!",5
"As with my other pilcro pants, i love the fit of these jeans. very soft fabric but don't stretch out too much after first wearing. the fabric is distressed but not so much that i worry about holes forming.",5
I absolutely love these sleep pants. they are very comfortable and the cute tea cups print makes them fun. i have washed them and put them in the dryer and they didn't fade or shrink. grab a pair while you still can you won't regret it.,5
"The fabric quality and style are amazing. the fabric is very high quality and so soft and the style is nice for an adult. i generally don't wear shorts because of length, style and other problems but i can wear these without feeling like a high schooler. i usually wear a 24/00 in pants, i ordered the 0 and was worried that it would be too loose and look sloppy on me but it fits amazingly. one of my favorite purchases ever!!!",5
"This dress is cut perfectly to have a lot of movement. love the colors. i went with my usual size 2 and it fit generously. i am 5.4 and the size 2 hit about the same as the model. 

my only complaint: it came really wrinkled and will definitely not make a travel dress.",5
"Wore it this weekend and the compliments were overflowing! it's exceptionally flattering for busty women (i'm a 32dd). i had to size down from an 8 to a 6, but even the 8 looked good, just a bit loose in the bodice. v neck is just right, not too low, not too high. print is gorgeous in person - colors are much richer than the online photo. the flowy skirt is very slimming and forgiving for hourglass and pear shaped body types. but if you have slim hips, you might feel like you're swimming in fabr",5
So nice. lightweight flannel with precious contrasting gingham cuffs. will look stylish on all heights. very impressed with the styling and construction. fits slightly larger than tts but figured that was to account for potential shrinkage.,5
"This dress is quite the stunner! i love the mix of patterns and the asymmetrical hem. four stars in quality, though, as it could have a bit of pure cotton in the fabric composition, as opposed to rayon + viscose only. still, a versatile dress, for day or night. i love the length of the petite size (please note i'm 5' 4"") the shortest part of the hem hits right at the knees. a keeper.",5
"These jeans are perfect--exactly what i was looking for. i was afraid the rise might be too high but it was just right, well below the belly button. i abhor anything resembling a ""mom jean"" rise. they will look really chic with boots as well as sandals or flats. i have lots of pants in my wardrobe but i have a feeling this will be a favorite pair.",5
"This dress is beautifully tailored and so flattering. i feel very comfortable wearing it to work because of the sleeves and neckline, but think it would also be good to wear out. i'm so happy i bought it.",5
I love this top. i typically wear small in most retailer tops and decided to size down in this to an xs and i'm glad i did. well made and cute floral design that can be worn year round.,5
"This dress is simply unique   beautiful! i said it runs large, but that only because the bodice is a little looser than anticipated. i decided to stick with my normal size 0 though so i could have a little extra room. for those wishing for a tight fit, size down. i love the colors in this dress; i typically shy away from bright colors and pinks but paired with the muted yellow/brown",5
I travel a lot and like to wear something other than jeans when i go out in europe. these pants are comfortable and yet i can dress them up. great fit and really nice fabric. i bought these in two colors.,5
"Gorgeous colors, high quality. my only word of caution is that the top part is very tight. if you have a large chest (c+) this is going to be snug, or not fit at all. i'm wearing it now in pregnancy, but i think it will also look great post-partum. can be dressed up or down.",5
"Tracy reese always pleases. this coat is absolutely awesome. it is gorgeous! the faux fur is soft and cozy. this coat is warm. i love the snap closure. this is the sort of attire that makes you feel lovely and is cheerful for those dull winter days. so happy to have in my wardrobe. a collector's item, for sure.",5
"I love these jeans. at first, i was unsure of what shoes to wear with the length of the crop. i don't wear block high heels ( as pictured) everyday chasing after my boys. but once i figured out which shoes looked cute i was in heaven. the fit is very flattering and it will be a great jean for everyday fun!",5
"This dress has a charming ""carefree"" look that invites fall.",5
This dress is absolutely beautiful. i wear with with a flat shoes gold. i got a lot of complaints. i was witing the fall season finale antro bringing what i want.,5
"What a fun dress to wear. it feels great, and looks great. i feel good when i wear it. if i was a kid i would wear it everyday, ha ha.",5
I just wore these for the first time and they are so comfortable. the mid rise waist is not too tight as many jeans are on me and the fitted hips keeps the wide leg crop cut from being frumpy. i wore them with sandals and i think they will wear well with booties and boots as the weather gets cooler too. they are a substantial weight jean not just for summer. these jeans will be seeing a lot of wear.,5
"I at first only intended to try this jacket on and get a feel for the fit and style, as i've been looking for spring/fall in-between weather outerwear. but i unexpectedly (and maybe unfortunately for my bank account) fell in love instantly. the fabric is very soft, and the cut is cute, stylish, and flattering. the quality seems good, and the fit is perfect. i ordered an xs regular in the moss color.",5
"Overall, quite good red skirt, though a little clingy material. good that it has lining. the waist is elastic. xs fits great on me (5'4"", 120lbs).",5
"These are terribly unflattering the wash looks dirty and the rise is not 10.5 like the description says, which is the only reason i gambled on these it is 13"".",1
"I'm a new mom, and am thrilled at the structure and quality of this dress. it gives me a great shape, very flattering. i can wear it to work with a jacket or dress it up with jewelry for a fancier event.",5
"I love the cut of these pants! kind of a flare, kind of a boot cut and super flattering. they are long so really need heels to keep a nice leg. they have tons of stretch so i could wear two different size. i choose the smaller for a little less length in the leg. i consider them more pants then denim.",5
"I'm not normally one to spend $89.99 on a dress from retailer, but when this dress arrived in the mail it was a no-brainer that i would keep it. it hangs beautifully on your body and the fabric is extremely comfortable the tie at the waist is really flattering and the neckline adds a little bit of fun. i imagine it can go from season to season pretty easily: springtime with a cardigan and flats --> summer with wedges --> fall with tights and boots. i love pieces that can serve different purposes a",5
I purchased this jumpsuit for christmas parties this year and have received so many compliments. it's a great fit and very comfortable. i especially love the pockets! very flattering.,5
"I honestly can't say enough wonderful things about this beautiful skirt. it is so soft and comfortable, very flowy and flattering, i have a smaller waist but wider hips, and this accentuates all of my best features! i highly recommend this skirt for any occasion! i wore it to my bridal shower and got soo many compliment and i really couldn't stop touching the material. what a wonderful addition to my closet!",5
Fits great and just as pictured. the material is very smooth and slinky.,5
Perfect slimming fit. wore it to work and then on to a holiday party. received multiple compliments throughout the day and evening!,5
It's a beautiful skirt. the color is vivid and the skirt is flattering.,5
"Got the wine color and love it! the design definitely is slimming! 5'1, 120lb, got  size 4.",5
This sweater is gorgeous! the color is a true periwinkle which really attracted me to it. the bell sleeves are a nice change. i have very long arms and they fit perfectly. i could wear this sweater out.,5
Love the high rise and stretch of this jean- i feel long and lean which is tough for a short curvy girl! i feel these run a little small for pilcro- i went up a size.,5
This top is so pretty. the fabric is absolutely gorgeous and the lace on the collar and back add an elegant old world vibe to this beautiful blouse. it is very light and flowy and i can imagine it will be nice and cool for those hot summer days to come. i am rather large chested so it does look a little tent like from the side but that is not the case fron the front and honestly i really don't care because it is so comfortable and pretty. i know i will wear this top quite a bit this summer.,5
I love this dress. the fabric is creative...checked lace. the silhouette is figure flattering. work appropriate and can wear it for dinner with a change of shoes and jewelry.,5
"Love, love, love this dress! the color is a beautiful blue grey, and the peach embroidery has just a tiny bit of sparkle. can be dressed up or down.",5
"These are called jeans but they aren't exactly jean material. they are black with a nice stretch to the fabric. a bit tighter on the thighs than the flare jeans but the stretch to the fabric makes it work. i like these very much, a very slimming effect. mid rise- which looks very chic.highly recommend!",5
This beautiful blue sweater was exactly what i wanted!,5
"I usually wear size 4 but the 2 was perfect, 4 would have definitely been loose. really nice zipper in the back, this skirt is thick and has a stiff/bouncy construction to it due to the neoprene which i was worried would make me look large but it is still soft enough that it doesn't do that. i usually have to get petite for retailer and this was no exception, the nonpetite goes beyond my knees awkwardly...

strangely enough, my only criticism for this is that the outer shell seems to get largish w",5
As always these pilcro pants did not disappoint. i can always order a size 26 and know they will fit like a custom pant. i actually like the fit on me better than shown on the model. there is no crotch hang like in the photo. i need to wear heels with these because of the length but heels and flares are very slimming.,5
"I was so surprised to find this in the sale. it is beautiful. light and airy while lined. the color is bright and fun. it is so comfortable. i ordered an xs based on reviews (this is my typical size in this type of style) and it fit great. i ordered the regular length even though i am only 5'4"". i am about 120#. will be an easy ""go to"" skirt to throw on for a casual look or can be dressed up. did i mention comfortable?",5
"The color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester. on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet, that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing. i've attached a picture of the ""hem"" below. on top of that - the ruching is awkward (as mentioned by another reviewers). all in all - kind of terrible.",1
"This is a beautiful dress! blend of materials give it a great feel, the cut and style are very flattering. colors allow it to be carried over multiple seasons either on its own or layered for colder weather! very happy with this investment!",5
Love this skirt. super soft and flowy. the red color is beautiful. i love the detailed raunching for the waist band. the length is perfect at my knee is i wear it empire waist style or below my knees if i wear on my hips.,5
While being stylish. the dress is well made and comfortable.,5
"This skirt is so ladylike and light as air! the cherry red color is beautiful - just as pictured. i can imagine so many opportunities to wear this skirt. with a sweater and tights now, and maybe a striped tee and sandals in the spring.
i'm sure i'll have this gorgeous classic in my wardrobe for a very long time to come!",5
Beautiful emerald green color in a lovely silk. i suggest one size down if you're small chested as the arm holes will fit more snugly.,5
"Love this dress! i've been looking for a nice nursing friendly dress for a while and this one is perfect! its so soft and hangs nicely. its very versatile and can be worn for multiple seasons. i ordered a size small which fits nicely, but could have done an xs or small petite. (for reference, i am 5'2"", 118 lbs).",5
"This dress is incredibly soft, comfortable, and essentially lined (i mean, look at all that intricate embroidery... your skin has no idea it is there). the colors are lovely (the embroidery is sort of a soft peachy cream lined with gold) and the dress is even prettier in person. the neckline is low, but not too revealing, and, though i normally avoid shirts without sleeves, the cut is flattering around my arms. the cut of the hem is also flattering. in some ways, the belt seems like an extra pie",5
Fantastic price right now and very flattering!! cute and sexy dress that hugs but its forgiving!,5
Very versatile dress.  runs a bit large i am 5 foot 2 (105 lbs) and ordered the xs petite and it fit perfectly!,5
"I really like this dress. i tried it on in the store and i had to take it home with me. the print is fun and bright and interesting, without being over the top. the grommets give it a little bit of edgy balance to the sweet, flowy shape.

a note on the the fit: i am a 12/14 and the 12 fit well. it is a bit loose in some places, like the waist, but it certainly doesn't look like a maternity dress. i think the looseness is a good part of the overall look. i am high-waisted, and the waistline hit",5
These are very comfy and look great on! i would like to get a second pair in the lighter color.,5
Super cute plaid top. i love the colors they are vibrant and go well with my fair complexion. it is a short top and would pair well with high waisted jeans or skirts.,5
Love love love this blouse the cut outs at the top just add to it's elegance,5
"This is very cute in person. i love the colors, a tiny bit brighter in person. it is very feminine, with the ruffles, but with an edge. not too foo-foo. i tried no the regular size and it was a little short even on me, i would have to wear with higher rise pants, or show some belly... no petite on this one. the size 0 fit me at 115 lbs and 30dd chest. the material is light and airy, so great for warmer days. love it but in my wish list, didn't get it yet,...though the day it showed up at my loca",5
"I just love these! i ordered these in both the lighter and darker denim in my usual size 28. they fit just right, just like my other pilcro jeans. i'm only 5' and the petite version was not available so i will have to get them altered but that's typical. i love the wash in each of them and the distressing is good, not over-the-top. i'm so glad i got these! and the sale price was a bonus!",5
"I received many compliments on this dress. for a maeve dress it did run large. i normally take a 4 or 6 in maeve but with this dress i bought the size 2 and it fits perfect. i am 5' 2"" and 120 lbs. i have a little belly and this dress hides it well. beautiful colors and nice shape. it also hits at my knee so it is perfect for work.",5
"I saw this dress and fell in love right away! this is right up my alley, super comfy, perfect fit and love the stud detail. can't wait to wear!",5
"I found this top really flattering on. i originally ordered a 6 and found it a little too big. the 4 fit perfectly, it falls around your belly button area so a little of your stomach will show. it has a flattering scoop neckline and the ruffles give it that extra flare. very light weight for the summer, colors are brighter/better in person.",5
"I originally bought this jacket in a medium, but the sleeves were a bit long and overall fit a little big. i decided to exchange for a small and i am so glad i did!! this jacket feels great and the sleeves hit at just the right spot in the small size. i normally wear a 6.",5
This was a very odd fitting top. i should have read the description more closely. the colors are beautiful but the cut hit me in all the wrong places.,1
"I ordered this coat as it was on sale but it was so nice it would have been worth full price. i am 5 feet 1"" and 110 pounds - i ordered a 4 petite as i like jackets a little larger for a sweater underneath but i could have used the 2 petite as well. this coat is heavy - so also very warm. it is a little shorter than on the model. the colors are more vivid the blue is a denim wash blue not navy blue - it fits fabulously and the quality is great. i wore it to dinner with a navy turtleneck and must",5
I purchased this dress for a special occasion and am delighted it's exactly what i was hoping for. everything from the way it fits to the way it feels is perfect. i highly recommend it!,5
This top is lovely to look at and to wear... one to reach for frequently,5
"Run to purchase this jacket. i am in love. it surpassed my wildest expectations when it arrived. beautiful coloration, comfortable fit, fantastic fabric and gorgeous collar. i am so glad that i ordered it. please use this exact same design and offer this same jacket in other colors and patterns. i can't say enough good things about this item.",5
"I just received the acacia swing tank and when i pulled it out, i felt like it was christmas day all over. it hangs nicely and felt luxurious on my skin. even my husband was dazzled. the detailing of the flowers is delicate and feminine. the cutaway gives you a sexy, casual chic appearance that you can dress up or down. i can't wait to unveil this new piece at work.",5
Soft and romantic. i love it! just like pictured and i wear a cami under. dress up or down,5
It is one of my favorites from retailer. i received so many compliments while wearing it! i usually wear a 6 but i sized down to a 4 and still had plenty of room.,5
"Fell in love with these instantly in the dressing room. it was more than i wanted to spend but i don't regret it. quality is great, denim is just the right thickness, i love the wash... will be wearing these a lot. just like my other pilcros!  i'm 5'8"" 125 lbs. size 28 fits perfect and the length is just right.",5
"I disagree with the other reviews...the colors on this dress are great. bright against the black and the studs are super cute. and the ties at the cuff are a cute touch. fun dress. i think it's as fitted or not as you want. drives me crazy when people get hung up on their ""size"" to judge clothes. go up or down if it doesn't fit the way you want. i like it to flow a little so i sized accordingly.",5
These are way oversized! i have several pairs of pilcro jeans and these run way too large. wasted money on shipping. won't do that again:(,1
"I received this jacket in an 8. fits great with room . i am a 34dd chest for reference as i was not sure if i needed a 10, but the 8 is perfect. see my pictures as i feel the website photos are more bright as the actual jacket is more muted. buttons are very nice but the pocket flaps hit right at the boob area so it my bother some . very high quality, lined and will look great over some retailer dresses in the same color way i purchased last year. depending on the season this jacket would do fine",5
"I love these jeans. perfect amount of stretch, perfect color, perfect weekend.  
i bought two sizes smaller than normal.  a little snug when they come out of the dryer, but within an hour they are the perfect fit.",5
"Beautiful, feminine, flowy dress. love the brass button detail at neckline and around waist-gives the otherwise delicate dress a pop of ""edge"". had to detach the slip to get it on, but glad it is included with the dress. i purchased the small and fits like a glove (5'8"", 135lbs, 34d). can't wait to wear it!!",5
"I bought this for my girlfriend with the hope that my presumptive intuition about her style preferences and the fit itself would prove successful. fortunately she loves it and looks amazing in it!

the colors are vibrant and the unique texture really lends itself toward a clothing item that is special- even for retailer.

recommend it highly!",5
"I originally purchased these in a size 27 and they were big. i returned them and got a size 26, and they did stretch out after wearing them once - to the point where i could probably have gone done to a size 25. the cut, color, fabric and distressing are great. i am 5'3"" and the pants are a tad too long for me to wear them with ankle booties without looking odd. overall, i love these jeans and wear them a lot!",5
The material is beautiful and high quality however the cut is so awful! it lays very weird near the neck and shoulder area. it kind of forms this square but if you are larger in the bust area it causes the top to slant making it lay awkward.,1
"I loved this dress on the hanger and loved it more when i tried it on. i am usually an 8, but purchased the 6 in this dress. i preferred the empire waist to be more fitted which the 6 provided. you can decide which look you prefer. both looked good. i just wanted a less baggy look. as one reviewer mentioned, the print is cut different on all of the dresses. i think the colors pictured online are accurate. regarding the snake on the fabric, i have several snakes on my dress, but not on the back a",5
"Love this dress! light and breezy, but i'm wearing it with tights and a jacket for a winter look.",5
I'm anxious to wear this dress with boots. i love the colors and print. perfect for work and evenings out.,5
"I bought this online because i love the print on the dress and i was not disappointed. it is gorgeous! the waist on the dress is much looser than in the picture, but i am fine with that. i am 5'9"" and the dress length is accurate as shown in the picture.",5
"Beautiful blouse, very flattering! if you run larger in the bust you might want to select one size larger than you usually wear.",5
I had my eye on this dress for months. i came into some extra cash and bought it at full price online and picked it up in the store. the purple pattern is nowhere near as soft as pictures. it was very bright which disappointed me. it's also made for more busty women. at a 34d i could in no way fill this dress out. the result made it look so frumpy and unflattering. i felt like an old lady in a bag.,1
"I ordered this when i first saw it on line but it was backordered. it just arrived today and i am so very happy with it. so feminine, kind of vintage yet modern. the epitome of the retailer aesthetic. i typically wear a 0p ( 32 a -26-35: 5 ft 2 in) in tracy reese and the 0p is perfect. i gave a 4 for quality only because it is polyester, (however that also keeps the price down). it seems that every summer plenty by tracy reese comes out with a dress that becomes my go -to favorite and this year is",5
"Perfect summer dress: feminine, cool, with just the right flow. hides the bad, and has a nice shape.",5
"I wanted this immediately after seeing it in the catalog. i couldn't wait for it to get to my store so i ordered it and it did not disappoint! it is extremely flattering on my hourglass figure. the pattern and colors are amazing. the unlined lower half does not bother me. i will be wearing this with a denim jacket, light sweater, wedges, then booties in the fall! i fell like this dress will be able to be worn for years to come.",5
"Bought this for a summer wedding, it fit great and i got a lot of compliments!",5
Love it!! it does run big so i had to return for smaller size. fabric is nice very true to picture,5
"I saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27"" inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind. the top does seem a little blousey, which i typically avoid (34d already) but this was still super flattering. overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it!",5
"This was my first dress purchase this year, quite late. i've been disappointed with a lot of polyester/rayon/viscose dresses so far. if it's 100% silk or cotton, it's quite expensive. this dress meets all my tick marks: no synthetic, beautiful pattern, well-made, flattering to the figure. i have a silk slip so the absence of lining was not an issue for me. fits true to my petite sizing. it's a very easy to wear dress, no tugging with straps or a belt. it's slimming and skims the figure properly.",5
"These jeans fit like a glove while being flatteringly stretchy. i am 5ft 7in, 125 lbs and i have a size 26. these are my second pair of ag stevie ankle jeans and i can't wait to get more. they are a beautiful deep/dark blue. love them!!",5
"Not being into bright neon colors, i love this top! the fit is true to size and helps to hide my tummy. it's super cute and very flattering.",5
It's very pretty. i purchased mine in the floral. romantic floral. the peplum is true to photos. it isn't short as many are. the print is gorgeous and the fabric is soft and comfortable and the styling is perfect,5
"Ag is my go-to brand for comfortable, high quality jeans. these fit the bill!",5
I love this dress! the colors are so pretty and the fit is very flattering.,5
"I finally ordered this after looking at it many times, had to order the 00p as they were out of all other petite sizes, and to my surprise, it totally fits me! why i put larger. both colors are equally nice, but due to my pale skin (and only petite available) i ordered the ""yellow"" one (brighter colors). cut is flattering, love the pleat detail in the skirt, the 00p fit my 30dd chest, and 26.5 inch waist. the length is perfect, above the knee in front and lower in the back. good choice...",5
"I was urged to try this on by my usual stylist as she thought it would look nice with shorts i purchased or jeans or pencil skirt i own (she knows a lot of what i own). it is truly pretty love the embroidered cut outs makes the tank look stylish. the cut is also flattering, though i think i'll have to wear a strapless bra. color is also warm enough to work on pale skin like me or a golden tan. i purchased the 0 regulr, tried on petite but i found it was short and flared too much. i am 115 lbs 30",5
"This dress is absolutely gorgeous. the fabric is light and comfortable. the colors are even more vibrant in person. it has a keyhole opening in front, which might not be for everyone, but which i really liked. the only things i would caution buyers about, is that it is not lined, and for shorter buyers (i'm 5' 3"") it runs a bit long, so if you can pick up the petite, that might mean a better fit.",5
"The print on the fabric of this dress is stunning. it is lighter weight than i anticipated, and the photo didn't show the keyhole opening in the front (which i like but may not be for everyone). i am pear shaped and on the tall side, so the shape works nicely on me, not too snug in the middle or rear. not sure about someone not as tall or more busty. i typically wear a larger size on the bottom than the top, so i ordered in the larger size which fit well.",5
"I love this top!! fits perfectly, and not too long. i'm 5'4"", 112 lbs and a 32dd and the small fits like a gem.not too fitted, but not boxy. i like that it covers my waist, but isn't too long, either. i may order another one i love it so much!",5
"I saw this dress in the catalog and had to have it. when i went to the store it was sold out so i had them order and ship it to me in two sizes - my regular and one size larger. when i got them, i tried on my regular size first and it was just perfect! beautiful pattern and material. light and airy. sexy with the low-cut ""keyhole."" i am sooo happy with my purchase.",1
"I love the design of this top - short and swingy, with a cute mock turtleneck and interesting textured pattern. definitely runs large - if you're between sizes, definitely go for the smaller one. it also has pretty large armholes, so you can kind of see your bra from the side.",5
"One of my favorite dresses in retailer!
floral prints caught my eye at the first sight, so i had been desperate to have it!
it looks pale on picture, but in reality, it is brighter than you imagine it would be. 
along with soft, floral, pretty color, i like the design of skirt. 
compared to the front, length is longer on the back. 
it fringes nicely, so it looks elegant when i walk.
and the last thing i'd like to point out...
because of the textile, it is quite easy to fold into appr",5
"The delicate print and coloring are stunning. i also like the length and fit and am really enjoying this dress. 
the key hole opening was a little low and showed my bra so i had to sew up the bottom inch, i also agree with an earlier comment that a full lining would be nice.

this is the first dress i have bought from retailer because i generally find dresses are too short and do not provide enough coverage at the top. i hope that future collections will include midi dresses and hemlines",5
I love ag stevie jeans but these are my favorite. super soft with just the right amount of stretch. they keep their fit and don't stretch out. the very dark wash makes them extremely flattering. i'm petite and a bit curvy and these are extremely comfortable.,5
"The dress is just perfect. it's fits true to size and the colors are as pictured. also, a bonus, it travels well - despite having so many pleats it folds nicely and can be worn right out of the bag. very happy i got it while on sale.",5
"There is simply no way to wear a bra with this top. that being said, the cotton is substantive and crisp, the embroidery striking, the coral color bright and summery. it hits me exactly where my hips begin to broaden, which i honestly kind of hate, but the top is so lovely no one's going to be assessing your hips. if you have narrow hips and perky breasts, though, what a perfect summer top (although, i suppose if those are your features every top is perfect!)",5
"I know you've heard it before, but this dress is so much more beautiful in person! i'm petite, usually size 4 but busty, so i tried the 4 and the 6 in the store. the 4 fit perfectly except it was a bit snug at the bust so the the slit pulled open, revealing a bit more cleavage than i wanted. the 6 fit perfectly through the bust, and although it was a bit loose through the body, the cut was still very flattering. i also tried the 6p, which fit but i preferred the longer length of the regular 6.",5
"This is the 4th pair of ag stevie jeans i have bought from retailer. the petite sizing fit me great (i'm 5'1 and 112 lbs) the quality is fabulous and worth the price. i have 2 denim, 1 white, and just purchased these dark wave. i went to the ag store and they do not carry petities. this jean is made exclusively for retailer. love them!",5
"Just wanted to let readers know that the dress doesn't flare out at the bottom like it shows on the model. for me, that's a good thing. it definitely sways and swishes, but doesn't flare out. you definitely have to wear a slip with it, not because it's see-through at all (it's not), but because of the static. 

also, this is the perfect dress for belt-lovers.",5
"This dress is wonderful and the petite sizing is really for petites! (i have recently returned two dresses and a skirt that were way too large in the petite offering...so i was not really expecting this dress to fit so well!) i ordered in the 2p. i am 5'4"" about 120#. it fits beautifully...even though it's a tad bit loose in the arm openings and i think i could have sized down to the 0p (it is no longer available though). but this dress drapes so lovely and the material is so thin that there is",5
"Very versatile tank.....i will wear it with slacks, skirts, culottes, jeans. it is soft; and the pattern is more noticeable than in the picture. i ordered the white; and i may order the black too. i am 5'4'', 130 lbs. ordered in small. the armholes are perfect - no gap at all.",5
I really like this dress. it does not bother me that it is not lined. i feel very feminine wearing it. i plan to get a shrug to wear with it.,5
This dress is to die for.  the picture doesn't do it justice. so pretty and dainty.  perfect dress for a wedding.,5
"This dress is gorgeous. it is better in person than online. i love the detail of the pleats and the waist. it is light weight and perfectly lines and a beautiful dress for twirling with a martini in hand. in fact, my sister tried to steal it from during a recent trip to europe. it is that adorable and flattering - highly recommend!",5
"This top is so pretty, even better in person. it's made really well and i love that it's washable. i did have some initial reservations with the fit. i'm petite and small chested so i typically like to wear a bra to get a bit of extra 'help'. but with the way this top is cut, swingy and slightly bell shaped, i found that wearing a bra, even one with light foam cups (not even pushup), was making the shape of the top look really weird. once i took off the bra, the top actually looked great. i got",5
"You just can't go wrong with a perfect white top. i'm usually xs or s and got this top in xs & the fit is perfect. the bottom is a very subtle bubble hem that you can't really see in the picture. the top is boxy but not too overwhelming since the proportions are just right. thesis a great transitional top that will go with skinny jeans, pencil skirts or even a pair of utility pants. it can easily be dressed up or down.",5
"The fabric and cut of the dress is beautiful.  i am writing a review so i can share my experience regarding size. i ordered the dress in size 2, my normal size for this designer. it fit ok but was a little large in the bust area. for reference, i am a 34 a. i i returned it and ordered a size 0, which fits perfectly.",5
"I love, love, love this top! the color is beautiful, a pinkish-orange, about exactly how it looks online. it is soft and light weight for summers. it does run a little big, i debated between a 0 and a 2 and ended up with a 2, i'm almost 5'7"" and 130lbs for reference. it wings out on the sides at first, once i steamed it at home and relaxed the fabric a bit it draped nicely, so don't let that turn you off from it when trying it on! part of the design is cut out through out as a warning,",5
"These jeans are very comfortable, with the higher waist. they have a slight stretch and keep their shape. i also like that the inside is a darker color, which looks good when rolled up.",5
"I love this tank top. i was looking for a mockneck tank for a while, and this totally fit the bill. i wear it to work and out, and feel great in it.",5
"I am 5' 4"", a size 8-10 (size 29/30), and my figure is apple-ish. i can't pull off peplum tops because they are too tight for my shape and they flare out at an unflattering spot. all of those ""rules"" go out the window with this tankini.

first, swimsuits are supposed to be tight, so that problem is eliminated right away.
second, the flare-out is perfect for women that want to hide their tummies. i don't like how swimsuits are generally tight in the tummy - that's the area that i'd like to hide t",5
"My favorite pair of ags. i normally wear sz26 but i have awkward proportions when it comes to finding jeans that are actually ""ankle"" length on me. i orders these in a petite and went a size up to be safe. it doesn't seem like they've stretch out any and they fit exactly how i want. i love the dark wash bc they can be both dressed up and down.",5
"I have been searching my entire marriage -- 11 years -- for the perfect christmas and valentine's day dress. it had to be red, it had to be the right red, and it had to be my style. there were several i saw over the years that were either too burgundy or too matronly. when i saw this dress, i knew my 11-year search was over! this is the most beautiful and elegant, red, special-occasion dress i have ever seen! i cannot wait to wear it for christmas! i think retailer should have reordered thi",5
"Ag jeans are the only brand that fit my body type. for reference, i'm 5'4"", short-waisted with larger athletic thighs, smaller waist, bigger behind (or pear-shaped) and shorter legs. this is first time i didn't have to cut off several inches in length, though i may need to hem a few inches as these jeans hit right below ankle (not above like model photo). i usually wear a 29 in ag, but went up one size based on other reviewers comments. ag jeans are worth the price: great quality and made in the",5
"I love this top! it's so hard for me to find conservative, comfortable and yet not mom-isn swimsuits. this top is amazing. it's comfortable and soft and great quality. i'm excited to use this suit this season!",5
"Very poorly made- wide and short, very unflattering. the material is advertised as cotton, but it felt very synthetic.",1
"I purchased this dress in ""yellow"" in a size 8 and 10 since i'm between sizes, and the 8 fits like a dream. i love this dress. it's a nice length, hitting just below my knees, and i can pull off strappy sandals as well as wedge heels and it all looks great. i also like that the top is situated so that i can wear a regular bra with it. i was concerned that the pleats would look tacky in person, but they give the dress a nice amount of movement and swing. highly recommend!",5
So much prettier in person! beautiful colors matched together! so light and relaxing! love at first sight!,5
"As always, these ag stevies are perfect. i was worried they would run small, but they are true to size on me. i'm about 5'2"" and ordered the petite length and the length looks like the model on me. just above the ankles.",5
Very pretty and a nice fit. lighter weight than i expected at this price but as long as it holds up i'll be happy.,5
"Agree with other reviewers that the sweater might swallow you up unless you are tall. it's soft (not itchy), well made, comfy and stylish. i want it to get cold out so i can wear it!",5
Beautiful and high quality. unfortunately it made me look top-heavy. i am a 36dd .,5
"Great job from the fabricators in creating such a gorgeous print on light-as-air silk! i'm so happy with the dress and can stare at it for hours, that's how pretty it is. the fit is perfect on me and disguised my figure flaws since it's an a-line skirt that doesn't cling. yes, the skirt is sheer and unlined and for the price a slip should have been included. fortunately i own a silky half slip that complements nicely. i'm a top heavy 36dd, large rib cage, 140# with a square waist and no hips and",5
"I love this top so much that i ordered it in second color. it is shorter but still works with skirts and pants. the material is a fun texture. i didn't have any problems with the arm holes, but this may be due to being less full in the bust area.",5
"Love this sweater! i purchased both the green and gray versions and will wear them constantly this winter. although some reviews were critical of the feel of the yarn, i do not find this to be a problem... so happy with these products! for reference to size, i bought the m and am 5'11... the sweater hits me exactly where it does on the model.",5
"Love the fit, i purchased a medium,and like the room it gives, not snug against my body. the waistline cut is my favorite. purchased three colors, black, white and mustard. all are very flattering for my age (60) and i wear with my skinny jeans!",5
"This is such a flattering, easy to wear dress! i am a size 6 with a 32g bust, and this dress fits me perfectly. so if you're busty, this should work for you too. soft, flowy, feminine. looking forward to warm weather!",5
"Absolutely adore the simplicity and style of this dress. dress is quite flowy, the fabric under the pleats is very soft making is quite comfortable.",5
"Swimsuit shopping can be the worst. it's difficult to find bathing suits that fit well and are flattering. this swim top is a winner. the straps are comfortable, and the scoop in the front was not too low for a 36d cup. the best part is the higher back! a lot of swimwear dips in the back, but this does not (read: eliminates the dreaded back fat). my only concern was that it isn't super supportive for larger busts, but i'm keeping it because i love the straps and how it flatters overall. this wou",5
"This dress has a marilyn feel to it, felt like a dream",5
"Just bought this for easter and it fits beautifully! not only is the cut very flattering, but the colors and fabric are perfect for spring!",5
"The cut of this dress is designed for any figure! the back hem sweeps as you walk, and the pleats prevent the material clinging to places you want to downplay, such as bulges. even flat chested women can look curvy and lovely in this dress. only downside, if any, is the lavender coloring which doesn't do much for impact if you are pale skinned and fair. i'm blonde, and while i got lots of compliments on the becoming flow of the dress, even i can see it doesn't say wow because i kind of fade away",5
"I am a huge fan of ag stevie ankles and own at least a dozen pair. i am 5'4"", so this style is perfect for me. this particular wash is a fantastic and flattering fit. it hits right above my ankle and fits beautifully through the hips and legs. i am going to buy a 2nd pair as i know i will be wearing these all the time!",5
"This is the second of the new dress batch i have purchased and it is lovely. this catalog shot does not do it justice.

the colors are brighter, but not neon, lots of indigo and coral. there is a tad of yellow? the bodice makes my aa size look much ""more."" the bodice fits me perfectly as the top pleating is flat. the v neck is just right - not too low, and the back is even prettier.

the dress just fell gracefully out of the package without a wrinkle and without a mussed pleat! that was a sh",5
This top is really comfortable but dressy enough for a business/casual office. the fit is nice and loose without making you look larger than you are. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear this.,5
"I love this dress! it is perfect for a wedding, brunch with friends, or even work. it is beautifully made and is comfortable. i have it in the yellow colorway, but i am tempted to go back and purchase it in the purple colorway as well.",5
"This dress is much prettier in person! colors are more vibrant and don't need to iron!!! the neckline was too low for me, so wore a light purple cami underneath which matched the purplish shade of the dress! perfect!!!",5
"These are a perfect staple piece: you can dress them up or down, and they're insanely comfortable! even if you hold a lot of your weight in your butt and thighs like i do, i feel like these pants do such a nice job of being form-fitting and flattering without squeezing the life out of you. i have always loved any and all retailer pants in this style, because they just fit so well and last a really long time. i will continue to buy these for many, many years!",5
"Love the color of this- a rich, dark green- it is super cozy and perfect to throw a long sleeved shirt under- it is roomy, not fitted. i ordered a small, then thought i should have ordered an xs,- so then i ordered an xs as well. i go between xs and small, but because this is not fitted, the xs is perfect. material is nice- soft and super cozy.",5
"The colors (including the deep blue in the background) are as vibrant and harmonious in person as you would hope, it looks like an oil pastel drawing! the print itself is very well done, i'm so picky about the quality and resolution but even up close every part is beautiful. 

the cut is great, it doesn't show too much of the armpit, the straps and sides cover a normal bra, and the neckline just shows the collarbones.

the feel is very light and floaty; some sites mislabel the material but t",5
The arm holes are a little large but not to a point i can not deal with them! it hits just at the right place on my body and is very flattering. i love the print and it is going to be a staple with jackets and alone!!,5
"I wasn't sure what to expect when i ordered this but when it arrived i was pleasantly surprised that it's by postmark and has an interesting cut. i ordered the xl in the hope that it would be oversized and slouchy. it is that and more! the lightweight, sweater like material is truly perfect for the transition to spring. i look forward to wearing it tomorrow!",5
"My local retailer had one of these skirts in store, presumably a return. i was so excited when i found out that it was in my size! i'm 5'7 and usually a 2 or 4 at retailer and bought the 2 for reference. the skirt is made of a heavy fabric and the pockets are lined with paisley fabric! the seams look really sturdy and the skirt moves well. it's very cute and super easy to wear. i styled it with brown boots, an retailer belt and a white button down. great for spring/summer xx",5
"These are great, casual, comfy pants for summer. i'm 5'1"", 95lbs, usually a 25 or 26 in pants. the reg 25 was a better fit than the 26p.",5
Love this tunic. very comfortable and a perfect length to the knee. i wore it to a birthday party with brown booties. the green moss color is perfect for the fall in new england. can't wait to wear it again.,5
Better than the picture - i like the layered look and the texture of the fabric. great top.,5
This layered top fits true to size. the style is trendy and cute. the type of fabric is nice. i love the design of the back. i would definitely recommend it. it's worth the money.,5
I love these tights!! they're thick and durable and the pattern is super cute.,5
"This was way too big on me, so i gave it to a friend. not only does it fit her really well and look great, but it has become her new favorite sweater! love the casual everyday style, and am tempted to order one in a smaller size for myself.",5
"Love these tights. fabric feels great, soft and comfy. took large so they fit perfectly at true waist for 5'6 height. some retailer tights i have bought in large, but they are too short for 5'6"" person.
the color of this paid is a subtle green. looks great with black skirt and green sweater.",5
These pants are so comfy and perfectly casual without being sloppy. they're the perfect summer pants.,5
"These pants have quickly become my go to spring pant. comfortable and a long enough crop for my 5'8 legs, almost closer to the ankle which i prefer. i wore them 3 times with out washing and they did stretch out a bit but there is a set of buttons in the hip if i really needed them tighter there. i bought the darker color, its a mossy green/grey. it looks sharp with the tla black v-neck t shirt.",5
"These are the best trousers i have bought in a long time! i'm 5'8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist--not enough to size down. i love that they are not ""skinny""--so over the skinny fit. i plan to wear these with black heels, white tee, and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time--oh, and a statement necklace--always a statement necklace. these are a must for every fall wardrobe! more pants like these, please!",5
"I totally disagree with previous reviewer on sizing. i am usually a medium (sometimes small) in various retailer tops and i purchased this top in a small. i could barely get it over my head. i then ordered the medium and large. i tried the large on first and it fits perfectly. (like the model shot). so i would say this definitely runs small. i never wear a large. for reference, i am 36c, broad shoulder. the gold beading on the top is very pretty and the gold embroidery thread really pops. t",5
"I have been a paige/pilcro lover for years! these mcguire jeans went on sale and i loved the neutral color so i ordered my usual size 28. they fit perfectly!! as a previous reviewer started, they are tight . . .they are skinny jeans and are meant to be tight. they hug in the right place, are not too high waisted and are a sturdy denim. for reference i am 5'2"", 120 # , short waisted and usually wear a 28 in paige/pilcro. these mcguire's, sized 28 were a great fit, good length, no hemming required",5
"These pants are so great. very comfortable, true to size, and i can see myself wearing these all spring and summer. i'm 5'1, 120 lbs, and my usual 26 petite fit great. these would also make excellent travel pants. i purchased the green color, and will be purchasing the tan color once i get done writing this review.",5
"I've returned multiple pairs of trousers this fall because they were low quality/ wrinkle-prone wool and unlined.  the material on these, however, is high quality and weighty, wearable in fall, but also great for our much colder winters. the herringbone is gorgeous - dark grey and black with subtle flecks of red, dark pink, and gold. they are also beautifully lined so will keep their shape and not itch! true to size for cartonnier: got a 2 and tried a 2 in the monica flannel trousers. gorgeous!",5
"These are the perfect light weight relaxing summer pants!
the fabric is soft and light, and has some stretch, so i think they can be worn more fitted way, too. 
i don't want to show off my bottom half of my body shape, so these are perfect ones to be a bit loose to covers the silhouette but still looks feminine & not too loose. 
i''m 5'3, 115 lb and usually wear 25-26 jeans, 25 petite gave me the perfect relaxed look without losing the feminine look. i think 24 could fit as well, but would sn",5
"This top is much more beautiful in person than in the photo. the embroidery is exquisite and there is the tiniest bit of sparkle amidst the design. soft, flowing and flattering. definitely a keeper.",5
I loved this top even more in person! it is made well and beatiful! the sheer under layer adds a sexyness to the design. the back of the shirt is open. i really like this detail!,5
Prettier in person! so pretty! i'm 5' 6'' 120 lbs and the xxs fit well. i normally wear a 0-2.,5
I am so glad i got these pants. the quality is great and the fit is perfect. they are very flattering and comfortable. i have worn them with flip flops on a casual day and have also worn them with black heels for a date night. worth the purchase!,5
I was very disappointed in the quality of this top. the first time i wore it it snagged right in the front. i had to pull the thread under so it wasn't exposed. i put it in the wash in the gentle cycle and it was destroyed with several more snags when i removed it from the machine. this top is extremely delicate and doesn't withstand normal everyday casual wear although it's s casual lightweight sweater. now it's just a wear around the house ratty throw around shirt.,1
Saw this top online and knew i had to have it! it's unique and gorgeous with the split back and two-layer design. the top layer is thicker and almost like a brocade/tapestry design with rich purple and yellow tones. the under layer is sheer and lightweight. i was able to wear this early in my pregnancy and it totally disguised any bump i had from co-workers. this is def one of my top 10 fav tops now!,5
"I just received these jeans today after buying them online last week. i wasn't sure how they would fit, but i am so very happy i got them. and on sale too!! i am 5'2"" and about 128 pounds. athletic and curvy but petite too. i bought the size 4 and they are a perfect fit in the length too. they are button up, boyfriend style but not too baggy. the detail on the cuff is perfect and they have a unique, unusual but expensive look. what a steal !! i would have paid full price for jeans that fit this",5
"Love these! they are my new favorite weekend pant. they are comfortable, versatile, and cute. the fit and cut are great too. a must have for your wardrobe.",5
Purchased to speak at an event. not only is it very eye catching and i garnered many compliments it fit like it was made for me and was comfortable to wear. i questioned ordering a 4 and possibly could have worn a 6 but with the elasticity to the material there was no problem with movement or sitting and i felt hugged in in all the right places!,5
"Remarkable dress, so much so that people stop me to remark about it!",5
I wore this to a wedding yesterday and received several compliments. the dress is well made and very comfortable. i know i will wear it again.,5
Wore it to a cousins wedding. loved it! probably one of the best dresses that i have ever worn. lots of compliments. felt great dancing the night away.,5
"I was so excited to get the dress, it's extremely beautiful and comfortable. the size i picked was unfortunately too big for me though, i just had a baby so it's hard to figure out what size i am now..details were exquisite.",5
"I don&amp;#39;t write many reviews but i loved this dress and had to share! i&amp;#39;m normally about a true 6 and have been finding a lot of retailer dresses running rather large. i tried this on in the store in a 2 and because of the stretch in it, it fit my hourglass shape really well. i have a melodies that pencil dress in a 6p that fits great so this style i think runs a bit larger. i wore it to a date night and it helped make the evening special.",5
"This dress is a beautiful, classic dress that is figure flattering and as stunning in person as it is in the photo. i love it!!!",5
"Love this dress. sexy but still appropriate. very elegant. i'm 5'6, 125 pounds, and the size 2 fit me great. it is a little long so i am considering ordering the size 2 petite. definitely worth the money.",5
"Great dress, received tons of compliments. downside to the dress is it stretched a bit and was feeling a bit loose by the end of the evening.",5
"This gorgeous dress arrived today and i can't wait to wear it. based on other reviews i ordered a 6 petite even though i'm 5'6"" because i wanted the skirt to hit just above my knee. it's perfect. i usually wear a 4 or 6 and the 6p fits well, not snug but not big either. maybe a 6r would be larger, i don't know. if you are worried about the skirt being too long then definitely try a petite size.

This dress fits like a dream and looks gorgeous on. i'm sure it will be a go to for many occasions.,5

"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! love, love, love! i am 5'2 and the petite sizing was perfect.",5
This is my 4th byron lars dress and i just love this designer. his dresses all fit the same as far as i can tell. i had bought this dress as my sister in law recommended it so much and she was right it is stunning!,5
This black dress is stunning...i've already worn it to a fashion show and a wedding and i received so many compliments!,5
"This is a very flattering dress that is perfect for those little black dress occasions. two other people in my family own this dress and love it, it's now my turn to add it to my collection. the dress is quite long for my 5""6"" frame, so i have reordered it in a petite size for a little better fit and length. the lace is very detailed and the nude slip underneath keeps the lace from being too revealing. very elegant, a little chanel like. and by the way, the belt is included, as another reviewer",5

"I bought this dress for the kentucky derby. i was worried about wearing navy to an event known for bright colors, but the gorgeous lace and rosettes are light and beautiful. i paired it with a lavender hat, and i was ready for a mint julep! i usually wear a 2 or a 4, so i ordered both. the 2 fit best. i will be wearing this dress to a wedding in the fall and for many events for years to come. stunning!",5
"I was looking for the perfect july 4th weekend dress, with enough room to be comfy (and eat!) while also being chic and feeling cute.

i got countless compliments on this dress.. the design is adorable, and the fit is really flattering. i'm 5'4"" and i weigh about 128 - i normally would have worn a small, but i had to spring for the petite xs. the design is a bit big and billowy, and anything else would have swallowed me up.

overall, great purchase. i am in love! :)",5
"I've been looking for white beach shorts and these are perfect! as another reviewer said, they are in fact see-through -- because they are meant to be a cover up, not ""real"" shorts. the hem detail is very cute and they're super comfortable! my size small fit tts, and the 3"" hem is nice for tall women.",5
"Got this dress in the mail today, and i am blown away. the fit is amazing! normally i would get an 8 in dresses, sometimes a 6, i got a 6 in this one and it's perfect. hugs in all the right places. everyone needs this dress! i feel like with the style and fit of this dress, it should be a little more snug so i recommend sizing down. cannot wait to wear this one!",5
I love this dress! it's very cute and comfortable. i belted it to give me more of a waistline because otherwise the tented shape overwhelms my short stature. i love the strap design at the neckline. the off the shoulder sleeves are comfortable. i have an xsp which is true to size for me.,5
"I am fortunate to work in an environment where i can wear jeans just about every day. so, i am always looking for a good pair to add to my collection. i bought this style on a relatively quick shopping trip with not a lot of thought. well, 2 weeks later i was back buying a second pair.

the color is great, a little darker with that warn in look but no whiskering with a fit that is tts. i like the higher waist to cover my mommy-tummy and my butt looks pretty fabulous. but, the best thing about th",5
"Incredibly flattering and going to be useful for multiple occasions - i needed a 'default' black dress and this is it.

only downside - it's pictured with a beautiful grosgrain ribbon at the waist, but does not actually come with the ribbon. i'll be trying to find something similar at a ribbon/embroidery shop, as the dress would really benefit from a slightly cinched waist.",5
"This dress has been on retailer's site for a while now (years?) and i finally grabbed one during a recent member sale. i can't believe i waited so long! it's so gorgeous on - classy but still distinctly sexy. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the size 8 fits great - definitely fitted through the hips and thighs and roomy enough on top i considered taking it in. beautiful dress overall!",5
"I am so happy with this! i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving it as i expected it to be of lesser quality than what i found it to be. it is a medium weight weave, grey sweater with a beautiful design and texture; one of those pieces that you will tire of long before it wears out! it is a great layering piece but not over bulky or structured tops as it is very smooth fitting without a whole lot of give. that is to say it is not loosely woven so it is better over a snug fitting item. the colo",5
This dress is really lovely. it looks so fragile online but in person is rather structured and substantial. it runs very large i just returned mine for 2 sizes down. i also like the zipper up the back so that the eye hooks on the front are not necessary to use to put on. the interior lining is affixed so there is no slipping like a typical under slip. if you are on the fence at least try it. i am glad i did.,5
"I wasn't looking for a little black dress but i couldn't resist this one. it's as stunning in person as it is in the pictures online. the front has a corset-like closure which i didn't realize until it arrived. it's very classy though, not cheap looking. the lace detail is really beautiful. i was a bit concerned about how the sheer looking areas would look because i was hoping to wear the dress for a dressy work function. it's definitely a sexy dress but the fact that there's so much coverage ma",5
"This is truly the best black dress...you can wear to sooo many things. a long time keeper for the closet. i felt it ran a little bit big...i am normally an 8-10...i bought both sizes (8 and 10)...kept the 8...but felt i could even get away with a 6...but didn't want to pay shipping again for another size. i am 5'7"" and 155lbs. it is truly a flattering dress for any figure.",5
"I love this dress. i found it to run one size big. i am 5'8'' 128lbs and went down a size to a 2. i purchased both a 4 and 2, then tried them on a few times, and the smaller size didn't pull at all because it fit me right, the larger one, hung lower and didn't look right. i received compliments all night when i wore this and paired it with black heels and a small back clutch. very comfortable too.",5
"I don't know that there needs to be more reviews, but here goes. 

the dress is gorgeous! i have never received so many compliments on a dress of mine, and i have some really lovely ones. strangers and friends alike were complimenting me. i had been eyeing this online, but never pulled the trigger thinking i'd never need a dress like this anytime soon. then i came across this in person at my local store, and i instantly fell in love. don't hesitate! and, if you're lucky that retailer is having o",5

"I've eyed this dress forever and finally decided to buy it. i literally read every single review to make sure i ordered the right size. i'm 5'4-3/4"", 36c-32-37 with a drop-waist that measures 34. based on the reviews, i ordered a regular size 6. i tried it on with a bra and also without, and the dress fits so well and beautifully both ways. but for complete comfort, i'll probably go without the bra (the lining and design don't show anything you don't want seen!). sitting in it feels great too. i",5
"I disagree with reviewers who said the dress looked cheap, cavernous or stiff. quite the opposite. i wore this to my 32nd anniversary dinner, and two women stopped me to say i was stunning. i am an average medium hourglass. the dress arrived in 2 weeks and was true to size. i wore a nude lace strapless bra underneath. the hem reaches the bottom of my kneecaps. the lace sleeves were not tight on my fleshy arms. the neckline lays flat. the dress zips in back, and the silver hooks in front are most",5
"Fabulous dress!
clip off the tags because they show through the lace on the back (you can see this on the back photo of one recent reviewer).",5
"I love this dress and am strongly considering buying the white, too, but i wish it came in another color other than white or black, because i would get that. goes great for nice dinners, dates, weddings, almost anything. it's not ball-gown fancy, but just fitted and nice enough to wear for work or a nice evening out. only problem i have are with the clips in the front. i have a hard time using the loo because it is very fitted, you have to un clip them and then re-clip, but it's worth the effort",5
This is a unique beautiful dress and it fits like a glove.,5
"I love this dress. i purchased a size down from my normal dress size after reading the reviews. i'm 5'9"" 148lbs 34dd and the size 6 fit perfect. the attached slip is a tad darker than my  very fair skin color but it still works. can't wait to dress it up with some nice heels.",5
"This sweater is light gray, as shown in the photo, not dark gray as the description states. i went up from my usual size so would say it runs small. it is lightweight enough that i think i will get adequate use out of it this winter in fl.",5
"I purchased this dress for my 50th birthday bash!!! it was stunning!!! the fit was perfect. i did buy it a size up, but could have worn my regular size. it is incredibly flattering and elegant. very well made. one of my go to black dresses for the summer!!!",5
The picture doesn't do this blouse any justice. the fabric is really nice and the back is really what makes this blouse. the bows down the back of the blouse make it pop!,5
"This dress is gorjuss!! i thought i would be in between a 10-12, but after trying on the 8 in the store--i'm a perfect 10. i was a little nervous about the price, but then i said, ""treat yoself!"" and made the leap and didn't look back. i felt so confident wearing this to a wedding and received so many compliments. i wanted a dress that made me feel sexy, without showing so much skin--this achieved it all! make the purchase--you won't regret it :-)

i'm 5'8, 195lbs and the 10 was spot on!",5
I was feeling defeated in my search for a dress for some upcoming holiday parties while shopping today. i saw this dress in the dressing room as another customer was trying it on. she was a shorter petite woman and this dress looked amazing on her. it instantly caught my eye and it looked great on her! i went and was lucky enough to find a size 10. lately i've been closer to a 12 sadly and was worried this was going to be another bust. i'm 5/11 and much curvier than the woman i saw in the dressi,5
"Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i",5
"I tried this dress on in store, and i realized it is true to size in every way. i am 5'1 and needed a petite for it to land just above my knee. this dress was elegant- i wore it to a wedding and some thought it was a ""rent the runway"" dress! ha! i'm way to classy for that. for all you ladies who want to look sophisticated in those cooler evening events, this is your dress! i felt so elegant and danced the night away and had no issues! the clasps go all the way down the dress, so i do suggest (li",5
"Best jeans ever. i have 2 pairs now. after getting my first pair last year, i knew i would be needing another. most comfortable, form fitting and flattering jean ever.",5
"I love these jeans! well worth the price. waist hits just right. the stretch is great. i can wear them with riding boots, booties, and flats. i love them!",5
"I have purchased over 7 byron lars dresses. i'm addicted to his style and perfect fit for the curvy woman. whether you are a 2 or 12 you will feel beautiful and if you care to present yourself on the occasion as a most lovely lady that oozes of mystery wear this dress. throw your next day dirty hair up with any classic retailer pins, barrettes or headband along with a strong lip color with earrings only. or go nude lips, smoky eyes and heels. this dress carries itself. don't over accessorize with",5
"I wore this to an engagement party and got compliments all night. it is absolutely gorgeous and very slimming! i got a petite 4, and it fit perfectly. for reference. i am 5'2 and 125 lbs. you ill not regret buying this dress!",5
"Bought this dress for a friend's wedding. i have since worn it to two others and the opera numerous times. it's my favorite little black dress as it's sexy and modest at the same time. i receive numerous compliments every time i wear it! it's easy to get into, the zipper is sturdy and the fabric is breathable, stretchy but not clingy.",5
"Bought this in my usual size small and it fits well. i wear it around the house constantly to stay warm this winter. it is so very warm and comfortable. very easy to wear. could be worn out, but i prefer it with lounge pants due to the comfort and warmth it provides. it is a nice neutral and can be worn with many other retailer casual clothes. highly recommend!",5
I wore out a pair of level 99 shorts a couple of years ago. ordered these in the same size and they are huge. so i am sending them in for exchange and hope i'm guessing right. linen and tencel are my two favorite summer fabrics. love the length which can be adjusted by rolling. good pockets. gorgeous somewhat dusty plum color. belt loops if needed though i rather hope they're not.,5
"Just got these in black and they look great! they are a great combination of classy and casual with the added bonus of being super soft! they are, however, very fitting/slender, but give a little with wear. as others have mentioned, they do run a little small, so sizing up one was the right decision. at 5'5"", they fall at just right place on my ankle. great pant overall - always love pilcro!",5
"This sweater is a hit. the color is fantastic and the shoulder cutouts add a feminine and unique touch. looks amazing paired with booties, a statement necklace and jeans. definitely affordable too! highly recommend",5
I've always been a pilcro fan and they always seem to fit just right. this pair of velvety pants was no different. lightweight velvet and a great cut. yay!,5
"I wish i had purchased these earlier in the winter season because i could wear them every single day. they are phenomenal, plus i got them during a great sale. the reviews i read said they run small, so i went a full size up and they fit perfectly. (i usually wear a 4, bought a 6.) one of the best winter wardrobe purchases i've ever made. totally versatile and because they're black, they can be dressed up, or down.",5
"These are beautiful pants! the wine color is rich and they are very soft. they just run really small. i normally wear a 25 regular but often i have to roll the length up a bit. so, this time i ordered a 25p thinking it would be the same just shorter -- but i could hardly even pull them over my slinder size 6 foot. i am going to exchange them for a 26 regular. i so hope that they fit -- they are so lovely!!
i totally recommend -- just order a size, or maybe two, up. though, to be fair, maybe peti",5
"I love this jumpsuit. i've worn it twice and received many compliments both times. absolutely gorgeous. i couldn't be happier. 5'5"", 135, 34c-6.",5
"This is cuter in person, more of a brown than a cream like in the picture. it runs a little smaller than i was expecting, but that's actually good for me as things usually are a little loose up top. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 32c, and an xs fit well for a sexier look, but if you're wanting it a little looser, i would go up one size.",5
"This is a great shirt with cute details including the ruffled back. i am petite and needed to shorten the sleeves, but otherwise the fit was true to size and not too baggy or too tight. the material feels avergage in quality, but looks polished with navy blue pants. i received several compliments during my first wear. overall, a very cute shirt!",5
These pants fit great. the velvet material is a sleek look . these pants can be casual by day and are easily dressed up in the evening.,5
"These pants are amazing! i love that they zip in the back and the material is just right. i am 5'7"" and they are the perfect length. i bought the black and now buying the gray. i hope they come out with more colors!!!",5
I was very hesitant to purchase this with such a high price tag but i just received it in the mail and it is absolutely beautiful. feels and looks high quality and i can't wait to pair it with the top the model is wearing in the photos. definitely worth it!,5
"I have other pilcro cord leggings & the black ponte knit leggings in my usual size 28 in this brand. they fit well & have a nice stretch - very comfy. i ordered these velvet leggings in the 28, the blue & the wine, & they just don't fit the same as the others. these are a little short in the crotch area & the legs feel restrictive & not much give. i have skinny legs! length is perfect though at the ankle. these same exact pants were just in at the store in black & fit a little better, but i don'",5
"My bridesmaids gifted this to me at my bridal shower, and of all the lingerie i received that day, this was the most memorable. it is equally romantic and sexy as it is subtly sheer. the delicate eyelash lace detail adds so much flair. i have this in size small and it fits tts. love this piece! i plan to wear this for my boudoir shoot.",5
"I love the pilcro pants and so when i saw these level 99 shorts i just had to order. they arrived and are as good as i hoped. the fit is great, the length is great (i don't like shorty shorts) and i love the color. the photo is very true to life in regard to color. i will definitely get a lot of use from these this coming summer.",5
"Incredibly soft and comfortable, not as fitted as i would like (this often happens to me with skinny pants, though). i want to wear these guys everyday!",5
Really great best.  nice substantial material and great fit.  will be able to wear with many things.,5
This shirt is amazing. i bought it in white and found i was wearing it with everything...so i went back to get the gold (which is yellow). the dit runs big so order a size down. love the riffle around the sleeve and the little dot trim. very cute!,5
"I love this top, it gives a little bit of a sleeveless look yet is more flattering on the arms for those who don't normally wear sleeveless tops. i think it runs very large - i'm normally a size s/m and the extra small was right. it's loose around the waist yet has a feminine fit.the tiny balls around the neck, button at the back, flutter sleeves, and linen fabric are all cute details that make this top unique. i also like how the fluttering goes down the sides and not just around the sleeve.",5
I love this pajama combo! it is super cute and comfortable!,5
"These pants are so soft and stretchy they feel like leggings. i love the ankle length as they are perfect to wear with both flats and booties. i am 5'5"" with fairly long legs and these hit right at my ankle. they are so comfortable i have ordered in the green, red and gray. my ""go to"" pants this winter.",5
"I first saw this online, and as a long-time wearer of vests, this really caught my eye. once it came into the store i was able to try it on, in grey small, and it was perfection. it just wasn't in the budget so i decided to wait for it to go on sale and watch the website every day. we have 5 stores in my area and when it got down to only 2 having limited availability for a small i sprang into action. the largest store had put it on the ""almost gone"" rack and they had only 2 smalls. i tried them",5
"I got this vest for my birthday and it is my favorite. it has a very clean design, well structured and you can really tell the product is high quality from the look and touch. i would expect this to stay in my closet for years to come.",5
"This little pantie is fun and playful. its a deep maroon color with small shimmering lace details. the back is sheer but the front is more filled in and opaque. the ribbons on the sides can actually be untied which is a big plus for me. i'm a small lass, but i have a big bum so i got a medium and it fits perfectly.",5
"-like others, i agree that this is a staple that will pair with many, many outfits. it is really well-constructed, classic, comfortable, and a wonderful length for us taller gals. as you can see from my stats, i'm rather tall at 5'9"", so it's hard to find",5
"I ordered my normal size 32. they were a little tight however i'm glad because they normally stretch out quite a bit so i'm assuming they should fit perfect after one wearing. the length is fine for my 5'9 height and they are very soft.. i'm so happy with the light red color, it's almost a rust which i love.",5
"Love this top. have two of them. they are comfy, light-weight and extremely flattering. love!",5
I love this dress! i was trying on some dresses in the store and the sales girl put this one in just for fun. i would have never picked this dress out. i didn't look awesome on the hanger. but i tried it on anyway and i ended up getting two other dresses at that time. but i couldn't stop thinking about how much i loved the way i looked and felt in this dress. so i did what any girl would do and bought it online. it took me a while to find it online because the picture on line doesn't do the dres,5
This dress is very versatile and i plan to use in all year round with some tights and boots in the fall/winter and strappy sandals in spring/summer. i originally purchased this dress in a m but had to size down for a more snug and flattering fit. the navy is much darker than the picture.,5
"These pilcro jeans are so very cute. i usually wait for a sale to purchase the pilco jeans, but i didn't want to chance them not being available in my size. the pilco jeans seems to sell out fast. the cotton material is very soft but not sloppy. you will love the embroidery down the side of the leg. they do run a bit big. i purchased them in one size smaller for a slimmer fit. i would suggest one size up if you like them more baggy.",5
"Found this cute little black sweater on the sale rack in a small and it fit perfect. it is flattering and will look great over a tank top or strappy dress. the little details of chiffon around the collar and the tiny cutout holes around the back, the softness, and the little detail on the back bottom make this a perfect go to sweater for me. i only say it runs small because it is a cropped style so expect it to be short, but i would agree that the arms are more to the snug side than the loose fi",5
"Such a lovely skirt. i plan on wearing it to a formal event, but could definitely see dressing it down with a jean jacket. it is so feminine and beautiful. well made and fits fine.",5
"So pretty, love hte design on this one.
i tried on hte regualr size, adn will not need a petite, it hit me jsut above my knee. younger gals may oprefer shorter, however.

the aottern is also nice. the cut is flowy and flattering, nothing bad to say about htis dress...",5
"I ordered the xxs because it seems like a flowy top, and glad i did, it fits perfectly. love the blue color, very rich. material is super soft, cut is very flattering, and i love the back. i tried it on with my strapless since that is what i was wearing, but not sure if straps show on a regular bra. (30dd for info)",5
"While the print is cute, the fit is a disaster if you are a c cup or fuller. the bottom band does not lay flat as pictured on the model (it rides up under your boobs) and the whole cup area tips forward - it's not really molded like a bra, more flat foam insert. immediately went back. hopefully, if retailer continues to do swimwear, they'll take a look at adjusting the designs to make sure they're also workable for fuller cup sizes (underwire please!)",1
"I tried this in the fish print and the pallas stripe. i did not like the fit of the fish print, but the stripe is perfect--so try more than one color if you are interested in this style. also try more than one size of course. i almost always order up in a swimsuit, and this time was no different. the medium fit great, although i am a xs-s according to the size guide. i am a 34b for reference, but i think my rib cage is somewhat wide. i do not like to feel constricted, but i still want the top to",5
"This is my favorite shirt ever. i've had it for years and it still looks great. please, please bring it back!!",5
"This unique blouse is very comfortable and looks beautiful on the body. it flowy and flattering and looks great with my tan. dress up or down, it's a staple in my summer wardrobe.",5
"This sweater is just the cutest- sweet and feminine with interesting details especially in the back. it's very figure flattering worn closed (there are 3 adorable little buttons) or it can be worn open over a dress or a cami.
it runs very small, i usually wear a small or extra small but i bought this one in a medium, mindful of the reviews. i'm so glad i did since in addition to running small the sweater did shrink a little when i washed it even though i hand washed it in cold water. it wasn't a",5
"I adore this dress.
the fabrics are elegant and unique and combine for a stunning look!
tried with a belt and looks wonderful with or without......so many options.
perfect dress for warm autumn days!
ordered my usual size and fits very true to size.
a must have!",5
"This is a soft, light sweater that will take you through fall. i got the raspberry, which seems more like a cinnamon color to me. the design is really cute with the fabric inset in the back. i got three of these in different colors so obviously i really like them for layering and can recommend them! it seems tts. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs. medium is perfect.",5
"This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also, the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.",1
"Super cute in raspberry and very flattering! i paired it with the reversible tank in dark gray, skinny jeans and fringe boots.",5
"Not only was it love at first sight when i saw it online, but i fell even more in love at first touch! everything about this dress is perfection. i got the black motif & the colors are just lovely. the weight & feel of the dress are nice, & the length is great. i added a skinny black belt for more waist definition, but it's cute with or without it. i am more than pleased with this purchase.",5
"This romper is so flattering. i normally don't like how short rompers are, but this fits and flares at the perfect spots on me. not to mention that it's super comfortable. i wore it last weekend and got a ton of complements. very happy i bought it! i normally wear a medium, but the small fit me perfectly?i'd recommend sizing down.",5
"I really wanted to love this dress, but even though i got a small, it was still too big. i also don't think the horizontal pattern was a good look for me, other than that, it is beautiful and the fabric felt nice.",5
"Love love this piece! for the moment i saw it i noted anther catalog, i knew i had to try it on... im 5' 9"" and 130 and the xs fits me perfectly. i love the way it is tailored. it is also lined with a nice fabric. overall a very well made summer go to piece!",5
"This is just adorable on. i go between a small and medium and the small was perfect for me.. i wore this with tights and boots, but can also see this working in warmer weather with sandals or peep-toe booties.",5
Can't say about fit just yet since it is a gift; color is soft green and versatile. finishing touches around edges and in back make it a stand out sweater that dresses up jeans but also nice over a dress or with skirt,5
"Such a fun and beautiful skirt, absolutely love the cut and the way it flows when walking ! it is very very bright in my opinion and not so much my style so i will be wearing it sparingly! got a ton of compliments the first time wearing it",5
Seemed pretty shapeless which surprised me because of the design. perhaps it was just too big. returned it.,1
"Cute dress. can be worn with boots, flats, or heels. i am 5'1, 112 lbs, 34 b chest and i got this dress in size petite small. i am pear shape, with a bigger bottom, and love how dress enhances my shape! my style is more classic, but i really like this dress.",5
"I was at first a bit leery of this dress because of the shape. baggy is in, but it's not always flattering. i am usually a big small-medium and the medium was too fluffy. i realize it's supposed to be loose, but not that loose. i'm 5'8"" and 146 lbs and the small was the best option. perfect amount of looseness but still gave a hint of shape. it has pockets and is so comfortable. i'm a school teacher so i try to find clothes that i can wear in both worlds. this is definitely a keeper! i will for",5
"This sweater has every special element i could want .... form fitting, feminine, and attention to detail. i ordered it in turquoise, which is a lovely muted turquoise that works well when dressed up or down with a cream cami. because i am petite, the fitted waist detail in back hits me just in the right spot. thank you, retailer, for another timeless addition to my collection of yours.",5
"I've been wanting to try on this dress since it popped up online, we visited san francisco this weekend & i finally got my chance. it fit great & was flattering! i am currently pregnant & it worked with my growing belly but will also look good when i do not have a belly. i would definitely recommend! <3",5
"Absolutely beautiful and well made. this pair of jeans is perfect, no flaws whatsoever. i usually wear size 27 but bought the 26 as it fits better. 27 is very slightly loose but i think it supposed to be like that for a boyfriend jeans. i prefer it nice and fitted, so 26 works better. i'm lucky to find them still available in the store while it's not online. i didn't hesitate to buy at full price, which i rarely did. i'm so in love with my new purchase. very happy!",5
Great style - can be dressed up or down.,5
Gorgeous! purchased in red; color is glowing if you have warm complexion/cool undertones.,5
"This dress looks so plain on this model you'd never guess it looks so adorable on. i saw it as i walked into my local retailer and tried it on quickly over skinny jeans i was wearing with grey suede boots and it looked amazing! it's a perfect teacher dress. wear it over tights or jeans during colder weather, chunky sandals during warmer weather. it has side pockets i absolutely love. you must try it on to believe it. the fabric is soft and of great quality.",5
This dress is absolutely hideous on my physique. ordered a size 6 and it hung on me like a cheaply made tent. i have an athletic built am a 34d. it is going back asap.,1
"I had only planned to check out this dress at the store but ended up buying it then and there! not a deal breaker but there were extra threads hanging from some parts of the dress. it made me a bit concern that the stitching would unravel during wear. so far, so good! i wish they had paid more attention to little details like that.",5
"I think these jeans are much better in person than on the picture. on the model they look a bit boxy and too loose for my taste. i am tall, slim/athletic and they fit like made for me in my usual size. they have some ""give"" and tend to get looser while you wear them, but because they are midrise they won't slide down. they are a slightly relaxed swlim fit on me. the demin is solid, the color a nice medium dark sky blue. the emobroidery and the beads are beautiful and look like they will hold up",5
"These jeans are fantastic! i've worn them once and got many compliments. definitely keepers. i am 5'8"" and weigh about 135. normally i wear a 29 but i sized down based on reviews to a 28. they fit perfectly at the start of the day, but as all jeans with a bit of stretch do, they get bigger as the day goes on, but because they're a boyfriend cut it all works. really happy with this purchase. my only regret is that i didn't get two pair.",5
I've been craving this dress in the brown pattern for a while and should have jumped the gun before the sale. so now i was left with size sp and i look like a fool--like i'm trying to wear a top from junior high and pass it off as a dress. my shoulders,5
"I saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it. it is, as one of the reviewers said, like having two dresses in one. the bottom dress is a full dress, and the top lays over it, not quite skimming but not quite loose either. i love the dress as i am a pear shaped, size 14, and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely. this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries.",5
"I was doubtful when i first tried this on. the holding horses brand tends to not quite fit me very well, more so in dresses than tops. also, it looks cute but not great on the hanger. this a must-try-on dress. it's just flowy enough to not look sloppy or maternity, but also feel easy to wear. the print and cut are flattering. it has pockets!!!! also, the length is nice, close to knee length. the fabric is good quality. doesn't wrinkle easily. i'm surprised how quickly i fell in love with this dr",5
"I saw this dress at my local retailer and passed it the first time. one week later, i stopped by and skimmed through the store and went back to the dress...and decided to try it on. boy oh boy! i grabbed a small and a medium (i usually wear a medium) and the small fit perfectly! the fabric is thick and feels so soft and nice. i love the pockets! worth the splurge and like the other reviewer said- it's not maternity like at all. i plan to wear it with brown boots or brown heels.",5
"Well...this is ""on me"" as i saw this hanging in the store, but way off on my size which is xxs petite.

i looked too quickly and got a nice sa to order it for me.

both pieces are transparent - no opaque lining at all is inside. both pieces are made of fragile clingy materials. there is no ""flow,"" just cling. the size is much too big so the resulting look is of two bad pieces hanging oddly without any real shape.

this may be the first time i really just not recommend a piece - at all. bes",1
"I saw this dress in the store window and had to try it on and it is perfect! it's lined, got pockets, can wash at home, and is a work appropriate length. it's cold in the northeast right now, so i'm wearing it with tights boots and a cardi. i really like that it isn't fitted, but is form flattering. overall win!",5
Better than a regular boring cardigan. goes with short sleeves and dresses!!,5
"I noticed this dress in the highlighted area and then read the reviews. i probably wouldn't have thought much about it just scrolling through the dress pages, and now i'm so glad i bought it. i have worn this dress several times and never fail to get compliments on it. i know i will wear it again come next fall. i am petite, but ordered the regular and find that length to be perfect. i'm a teacher and this dress helps me maintain a classy yet modern look. i purchased the small (usually wear size",5
"I love everything about this tee. it has wonderful detailing that makes it different from other tees. the fabric is soft, and the tee is very comfortable. i disagree with some of the other reviews about the colors. i actually love both colors. the red is a nice slightly brownish red. i wore that color with a pair of plaid (white, teal, & taupe) shorts, and i got compliments on my outfit. the color will go with more than one might think. i haven't worn the green one yet. i hope this tee comes bac",5
"Is this dress ever flattering! i have seen many variations of this kind of dress-some where they will kris-cross over the breast area, some where they will have a single twist-but i never have seen one like this with a double twist and oh, what a difference it makes. i particularly love this in blue-which was a very bright royal color in-store. i am not very chesty, so the accenting in that area is very flattering on me and made me fall in love.",5
Love this sweater - very soft and can be dressy or casual.,5
"This top was fun. casual with flair. it is a little strange that it is see through down to the stomach almost, but i would just wear a bra of the same color and don't think anyone would notice.  i didn't buy because even the sale price is too much for a casual tee, in my opinion.",5
"I love this dress. as a taller, long-torsoed woman, the sleeves are long enough and the length is perfect. the overall fit is also quite flattering, but i can imagine it might not be if you're shorter.

the material is really lovely and luxurious-looking for jersey. it seems like it should wear well.

a great work-to-evening option, as well!",5
A sales associate handed these to me while i was trying other things on. i had never tried the hoxton before. i have found my perfect black jean! they are so comfortable and they don't stretch out like others i have tried.  i am 5'4 and i roll them a few times but i like that look. i am usually a 25 and that is what i took in these.,5
"Paige denim has done it again with this version of the hoxton high rise. no matter how many times i tell myself that i will find a less expensive pair of jeans, i never can find jeans that fit as well and last as long as my paige jeans. this is a sleek pair of skinny jeans with the added benefit of being high waisted. as a mom who hates always having to worry about spilling over the top of my jeans (no matter how thin or fit you are, i'm sorry ladies, this problem is real!), the hoxton high rise",5
"The blue dress is lovely, fit true to size and a good all around, comfy dress.",5
Super cute and simple shirt (as other reviewer said lol). but she was right! i have another shirt from this brand and it's one of my favorites. it runs true to size. it's a nice casual wear with jeans kind of shirt and great for fall. it may be a little short for someone with a long torso and/or tall as i'm only 5'2 and i wouldn't want it to be any shorter.,5
"I saw this skirt in retailer several months ago and while it caught my eye, it was pricey. so i waited until it went on sale and pounced.  unfortunately i ordered a size 6 which is enroute.   i happened to stop by our local store today and decided to try on the 6 and ended up getting a size 4.  so i'll have to return the size 6 when it arrives.  i think it runs tts. i've lost alot of weight recently.  
the colors are vibrant and it has a nice weight with some stretch in the fabric.  it's a",5
"I saw this dress couple weeks ago and i really liked its color. the dress was ok untill i wore it. well. it's one of those dresses which are not great on hanger but great on you. well, the color is awesome, matches with other bright colors, mustard yellow, wine or black. the material is very thin so if you put size down it will fit but make sure that you see yourself in the mirror and see your back; i saw many ladies which put the dress which fits them but it does not fit the way it supposed to",5
Beautiful color and super comfy. it runs large but the gathers still allow for it to have shape on the top.,5
"I paid full price for this cardigan and have not regretted purchase for one minute, having worn it almost every day this summer.  it is the perfect weight for cool summer evenings, seaside strolls, chilly restaurants, or  for a sunblock layer when you have to be outside.",5
"Just bought this cardigan today. i'm already a fan of left of center and was happy with this piece. it's soft, has more interest to it than your average cardi. the sleeves are a bit long, but it's not a dealbreaker. i imagine it will be a great transitional piece from summer to fall and then for spring time.",5
"This is a nice year round weight sweater. 
i am thrilled with small details, true to retailer pieces.",5
"I oot this dress in the blue. it fits great--hits at the knee, not too short or awkwardly long. i just wish they had it in short sleeve so i could wear one for the summer. beautiful and easy to wear for work or fun.",5
I love everything about this dress. beautiful vibrant color and fabric. i got the sp which is a perfect length for me to wear with the jasper & jeera nijar sandles. it is very flowy and full but i love that about it. happy i was able to snag a petite size but i think the regular would have been ok. i could have gotten away with an xs but the small fits great!,5
"Love, love, love this piece! very flowy, but made of good material. glad i purchased this item!",5
"I love, love this top! it's the perfect peplum tee! i would get more if this was offered in more color combos! the stripes add a cute effect to the tee and it's a perfect soft cotton. can't say enough about this one!",5
"I have to agree with the first reviewer! i really loved the color of this dress and could almost have overlooked the lack of a lining, but when i felt the fabric expecting a nice lush silk, instead getting what felt like a polyster instead i couldn't justify it for the price. i really liked the fact that a maxi came in petite sizes as well, but just couldn't get over the poor quality for that price so back it goes! 

i hope the team members or buyers at retailer are reading these reviews",1
"Beautiful cobalt blue dress.
i wore it for christmas and had many compliments.",5
"I love this top! i love the detail in the front and the v back. it's simple and sexy, easy to dress up or wear casually. i ordered an xs and found it to fit perfect, i'm 5'5"" and 112lbs. i ordered the olive green color which i love. i don't typically wear red so that wasn't an option for me, i do wish it came in more colors!",5
"Love this sweater. ordered white, size large. great light layer! the weave in the yarn is really pretty; the variations in texture have an almost burnout look. the silver buttons are unusual, really stand out and complement the overall look of the sweater. it has an uneven hem that drapes beautifully at the back and sides. great value on sale! one of those basics that everyone needs in their wardrobe.",5
Love bailey 44. this dress does not disappoint. the blue is beautiful and the fit is very flattering. the material is really soft and the dress is very comfortable.,5
"Wish this site had ""ask a question about the product"" feature like amazon does. just wondering if anyone has seen this product in person to verify color? it looks orange but descriptor says red. would appreciate feedback. thank you for your help.",5
"Better than the picture, right chest neck line not too low. comfortable material and the cut is just right. bought two in different color.",5
"I bought this dress in blue. it's a light jersey material, but it is lined. i find it very flattering. i have found more occasions to wear it than i expected.",5
"Lots of stretch in fabric so pants fit well. length is perfect for me. i'm almost 5ft 6 in and they hit at bottom of ankles with slightly extra fabric so flats, heels, or boots work great with these pants. i bought size 29 and i'm 135 lbs.
colors in pants are beautiful. many different colored tops go well with them",5
I love wearing this dress and have had many compliments. it's a great color and a fabulous fit,5
I bought in white. great for a lightweight cover up. well made and cozy!,5
"If you've been an retailer lover for awhile, you have at least one of the left of center thermals. every single year they come out with them and they are best sellers - so when i saw this is couldn't believe it!!! it's just like the left of center thermal shirt, but a cardigan! soft, warm but thin enough that it would be a perfect layer for the summer. be warned that this fabric does grow with wear. definitely size down a bit. the body is full and the sleeves are fitted. lots of stretch and very v",5
"Super cute! very light and flowy. i ordered the black. packs well wasn't wrinkly when i took it out of the suitcase.
i ordered the black. so happy with my purchase.",5
I recently purchased this dress and am so happy with it. the gathered area over the bust is visually interesting and isn't too revealing. the jersey material hangs beautifully. i also appreciate it being lined.,5
"I own a couple of bailey 44 dresses and am a huge fan of their comfort and ability to flatter my figure. when i saw this one on a special promo, i knew i had to try it on. once i did, i knew it had to come home with me. i wore it to a work event last night and look forward to wearing it on a date night soon. i am a s or m and took a s in this dress. i went with cobalt and paired it with gold jewelry as in the photo.",5
"I am a big pilcro fan. i have a really tough time finding pants that fit, are comfortable, and flattering all at once, and these didn't disappoint. the colors are beautiful and saturated, and just like they appear in the photos. i got my usual pilcro size, and the colors give me endless styling ideas. i also got them in the black and ivory print.",5
"Fabric felt and looked cheap.  hem was completely frayed, all the way around, perhaps purposely, but ratty looking, all the same.",1
"Looks great, the material feels great but when i put this dress on for the first time today it fell apart at the seams in the rib cage area. total disappointment! i had purchased this on sale for my graduation and was getting ready to walk out the door when i saw two holes on each side!",1
"After reading reviews, i ordered a medium instead of a large even though i am typically a size 12. it was definitely the right decision. a very flattering dress in a beautiful color. if you order in the right size, it is not at all dowdy. it is forgiving in the belly area, which is great for me. it can be worn with tights or without tights, so really quite versatile. i am sure that i will wear it a lot. also, it is very comfortable.",5
I have trouble finding pants that are long enough and also narrow enough on my hips. these fit like a glove and never stretch out.,5
Super soft. pretty blue green color. packs super well for traveling.,5
"I love this dress, it is so comfortable and elegant at the same time. i try to not buy dry clean only pieces, but i had to make an exception here!! perfect for early spring days.",5
"I was really pleased with this skirt. the lightness of the fabric is nice and the colors matched the photos. i was initially concerned that it might be stiff and uncomfortable, but it feels like it has a bit of stretch and offers some good movement. sometimes retailer skirts seem to run small to me, but this fit perfectly in my regularl size.",5
"This gathered jersey dress is beautiful and flows in just the right places, however it runs large! i normally wear a small in many retailer dresses, however i ordered an xs petite in this dress based on other reviews. i'm glad i did because it fits perfectly. the dress is very flattering in the bust...and the rest of the dress hangs and flows nicely. this can be dressed up (with statement jewelry) or down depending on the occasion. i'm happy with my purchase, so much so that i bought one in",5
"I got the sweater in red, (i'd call it more orange). it's a bit of a baggy fit, not tight which i love. i feel like this will be a perfect cover up for cool summer evenings. i got a medium. i go between small and medium and i love the fit. i could have gotten a small, but i liked it looser, the buttons are special too.",5
"The blouse is absolutely beautiful. i am 5' and the length is perfect. even though it fit a little snug across the chest, it's a keeper. i'll wear it open on the top with a nice cami underneath.",5
"This is my third dress by this designer. i love his work. this will be the most versatile and classic of the three.
i love how wearing his dresses makes me feel... my best and comfortable. unique and well made.",5
I love this dress but sadly for me it didn't look good on my body type. i'm a 36 dd and not thin so it made me look like a beached whale. i saw it on two different sales clerks in the stoe and they both looked adorable.,5
"Not only is this dress incredibly comfortable, but it can be accessorized for any occasion. i jazzed it up for a wedding, but a cardigan and flats also makes it easy saturday perfect. only way this dress could be improved.... pockets.",5
"Wonderful dress! thank you for making a fun and sassy dress that actually fits me! normally this sort of dress wouldn't fit, with it failing me in the bust, but it fit quite well. in most cases, i would end-up in a 12 petite to accommodate my bust, but with it then too large in the shoulders, or, the dress would have run so small, i wouldn't have been able to button it in most places. i was pleasantly surprised not only with the fit, but the quality, as well.

as described by other reviewers, it",5
"Love this dress! i'm 5'4"", 110 lbs. i ordered 2p. the dress is stretchy at all the right places and accentuates your curves. it's very well-made. i usually like loose fitting clothes, but i feel this dress needs to be snug but not tight. i tried 4p and it was just a bit loose. this dress is well-worth the price.",5
I received so many compliments on this dress. i purchased my usual size 12 and it fit fine. i agree with some other reviewers that i could have probably gone a size down for a more snug fit.,5
"Beautiful dress and so delicately well made!
5'1"" 95lb - xxs petite or the smallest size possible worked for me
it accentuates one's curvy body and covers up any excess skin in the belly area. i could eat on freely at a formal occasion. words just cannot describe how beautiful this dress is.",5
Swing dresses can be so iffy but this one is fantastic! i sized down to an xs due to the chest area (i'm usually a s/6 up top 36b) and it fits perfectly. the dress is so comfortable and stylish without feeling like you're wearing a tent. this is the most i've ever spent on a casual dress and it is worth ever penny. could not be more happy with my purchase.,5
"Amazing dress! i'm a pear shape, and this dress is a very complimentary cut for me. it's also not too short. the color print on the dress are amazing. i'm very happy!",5
"I tried it on while out of town. i was concerned about getting it home but i kept thinking about it. i purchased it online once i got home. the colors are beautiful. it's a swing dress with quite a bit of ""swing"". this is perfect for me because i'm sensitive about my mid section. i wore mine with 3.5in brown sandals. my husband said i had ""legs for days"". i'll take that as a great compliment. i usually wear a medium but could have worn the small in this dress. i preferred the medium because it w",5
"Simply put, this dress will make you feel like joan from mad men (in all the best ways). amazingly form-fitting and impeccably constructed, like you imagine clothes used to be. it's true there are hook & eye closures between each button from about the waist up; yes they are a bit tedious, but they're essential to the flawless, gapless fit of this button-up style. i'm 5'4"" 120-125# and got the 2p based on reading every single review posted. it's a *tinge* tight but i'm very happy with it and the",5
I am currently wearing this dress. i wear it whenever i can get away with it. i have it in red and it works incredible on my coloring. the front is modest enough for work while the back is sweet and unexpected.,5
I love this dress. i get so many compliments from strangers every time i where it. must buy.,5
"Looks better in person than the pictures online. very soft and comfortable. if you are between sizes, size down. it is roomy with a lot of material that drapes in the front. just know that this sweater is short in the back and does not cover your backside.",5
I very rarely buy at full price but had to have this on and it is worth it.  i sized down and fits great. tons of compliments!,5
Bought as a gift. really soft and cozy. i am sure she will love it!,5
I absolutely love this product! it is so versatile and i can wear it up or dress it down. absolutely perfect paired with leggings to sit in classes all day :),5
"I've been looking for the right swing dress for a long time and this one is perfect. one of my favorite features is the design at the hem of the dress (it looks even better in person!). the material is a thicker, almost canvas-y type of fabric, which i love because it makes the dress feel higher quality to me. i love how comfortable the dress is and it's so easy to throw it on and look amazing. i tried on two sizes at two different stores and received compliments from staff and customers both ti",5
This is a fantastic dress! i wore it for a recent wedding and received many compliments. the fit is phenomenal; the dress is extremely comfortable and flattering. i am full-figured and it fit beautifully and was very true to size. this dress would look good on an 18 year old or a 70 year old!,5
"This is one of the most special dresses i have ever owned -- and i am kind of a dress person. this one has beautiful detailing -- sheer sleeves, but the bodice and bottom half are lined. fits beautifully -- i am a little busty, so i was worried about all the buttons in the front not buttoning or popping open, but in addition to the buttons there are hidden hooks to ensure it stays closed, which is unusual and a reflection of the quality of the dress. i am 5'6"" and the length was just right, abou",5
"I do love this dress. i wore it for my 20th anniversary party and received numerous compliments. it's great for embracing your curves. it has a wonderful ""vintage-made-modern"" flair that classic retailer pieces always have. you do have to be careful when wearing it...jewelry or belts may snag the intricate lacework. i am definitely the type of shopper who waits for a sale. this is one of the few pieces i felt i could splurge on. it is just that unique. i hope that retailer continues to carry these t",5
"The top of this dress is very flattering. there is a lot of fabric on the bottom half of dress. if you want something which hugs curves ,this is not it. however, one of the things i like about this dress is, it can be dressed up or down. i wore to a wedding and got several compliments. very comfortable",5
Super cute! no complaints! fun print! light weight soft material!,5
"The moment i saw this, i knew i had to try it on. it's a definite power dress - made me feel like marvel's agent carter! i could take over the world in this dress. planning to wear it to work, more casually, and as my holiday party dress. it's easy to dress up or down and is incredibly comfortable.",5
"Saw this on line and bought right away! perfect romper for summer- color is great and fabric is soft- like all cloth and stone chambray. it fits pretty true to size, maybe a little small when putting on, but i think it will stretch out a little. i didn't want it baggy. fits great through hips and booty looks good! i will wear with flip flops, sandals, or wedge. i also got 15% off which made deal even better!",5
"I love the fit of this dress! the fabric is thick and the shape of it is so adorable. i usually don't like bright colors, but i got it in red and it's just so charming. can't wait to wear it out!",5
Just received and tried it on right away. really flattering fit and comfortable! unusual neckline that you can wear plain or accessorize. i'm so happy i decided to take a chance on this one!,5
This dress ladies is simply amazing and perfect!!!,5
"This dress is absolutely fantastic. beautiful, high-quality, and fits like a glove. even better than i could have imagined.",5
"I was so excited to purchase this dress; i love all shades of grey for winter clothing, i love knits, and i have loved other maeve dresses. however, i simply cannot fathom how poorly this is designed--it fits absolutely nothing like it appears to on the model, to the point that i wonder if i might have received a defective dress.

for reference, i am 5'5"", slender and small-boned but also curvy (hourglass). my bust is 36 c, hips about 37-38. i normally wear a small in maeve dresses. maybe it's j",1
"Love the print and was looking forward to this dress. the length and bust are just right in normal sizing, however the 'swing' effect is all off. there's so much fabric. its like wearing a moo moo. not at all flattering. disappointed in this one.",1
"Tried it on at the local store today, it is very pretty! i believe i runs large. i am usually a small, but they only had an xs and it fit perfectly. it is made of thick linen and has a lining.",5
"I absolutely love this dress. it is very body conscious, but has some ""give"" to it. the sleeves and lines are beautiful. very well constructed... sexy without being overtly so. i find it very elegant",5
This sweater runs oversized; very soft and comfortable and colors are spot on for fall. love the sleeve length.,5
"The pictures don't do this justice. it's so beautiful on. drapes incredibly. the cream color is a warm, creamy bright off white. looks really nice. incredibly comfortable. i could see this being an excellent item to wear on planes. super cozy and chic. a must have.",5
I absolutely love this dress. i am 5'0 and 167 pounds and the extra large was way too big. the large was perfect. the fabric is substantial but the fit is loose and swingy so it is good for the atlanta heat and humidity. i want to wear this every day.,5
"I **love** this dress. it's definitely an investment, but well worth the price! i get so many compliments on it every time i wear it, and it can definitely be dressed up or down for casual or formal events.",5
"I tried this dress in store and was in love immediately! i had to special order a petite size, but fits wonderfully. for me, ran a little large. i'm 5'2"" and 105 and ended up with a petite xxs and it fits great!",5
"Beautiful skirt, love the colors. so glad i bought this. runs a little big",5
"When i saw this dress online - it was a must have. i preordered immediately and had my fingers crossed that i'd get it! thankfully it did! this dress has blown me away. it exceeds all expectations!!! i ordered an xl which is a normal size for me and i'm glad i did! the body is very swingy but the top is true to size. the print is magical. whimsical, bold,  bohemian and transitional into every single season. i am 5'8 and the dress hits just above my knees. i feel gorgeous in it. the ""woven cotton",5
When i saw this i had to have it! i was pleasantly surprised that i was actually able to go down a size (normally a l for the bust) but was able to get into the medium with some room across the chest. it drapes nicely and the inner liner is not tight but flows along with the dress. so many compliments each time i wear it!,5
"Oh how i love this dress! i was worried because i am very busty and sometimes that translated to looking pregnant in swing dresses, but this.... incredible! i am wearing it with either blue strappy sandals or red heels and it is quite the perfect summer dress! the material is thick, and feels elegant, the colors are vibrant. today is my first day wearing it, and i have already received 4 compliments! no kidding! wonderful! maeve clothing... i love you!",5
Was enchanted by this dress from the moment i saw it online. i was able to find it at my local retailer,5
"This dress is beautiful. it is tts, but since it is so flowy, is not form fitting. i am petite (5'4"" 115lbs) and this is a lot of dress for a shorter/smaller person. if it were less flowy, i would keep it. the design, material and overall product is, however, amazing! this dress would be a beautiful addition to any closet.",5
"This is an amazing dress! it did stretch out a little, so although i got the large, i probably could've gotten the medium. beautiful feel, fully lined, on the really hot days, this is what i grab and i stay cool all day. i get so many compliments on this dress! the colors are gorgeous!",5
I love this dress. the colors are eye catching. if flows nicely.,5
"I loved the look of this dress online, and it's everything i hoped and more in person.
i'm 5'10"", 155# and pear-shaped.
while the bottom of this dress is voluminous, it definitely did not have a pregnant fit on my body shape.
the length was absolutely perfect, it wasn't scratchy in the least. i got compliments on the dress all day long. wore with a pair of cowboy boots while wine tasting in napa.",5
"I'm obsessed with this dress.  it's so pretty and love that it has a lining.  i'm 5'1"" and got a small, i had dry cleaner take it in from the sides so i didn't look swallowed up in dress and now it's perfect.  still has the swing but not as bulky.   can't wait to wear it out!",5
"This dress is beautiful and i received so many compliments. it's form fitting but comfortable. it is just the right mix of classy and sexy. you can easily dress it up for a formal occasion or keep it simple. i am 5'6"", 150lb with an athletic build and a size 8 fit perfectly. i will be wearing this dress for years to come.",5
"I ordered this beautiful sweater skirt in petite because i'm too short (5'3"") for the asymmetrical hemline. i love the geometric pattern on this skirt and the gold flecked waistband. and the light sweater material make this a perfect skirt for my california fall/winter.",5
"Heavy in weight but not uncomfortable to wear because it's fully lined and has an easy fit that skims without looking like a potato sack! fits a little large but mainly tts. if you're between sizes, then i would size down, unless you're very blessed from the waist down. i am a m/l on top and s/m on bottom and bought the medium. it's a relaxed dress (like a shift suppose to be) that i can wear a turtleneck under without feeling stuffed.",5
"When i saw another shopper holding up this dress for assessment in my local retailer store, i knew i had to have it! i bought it in the red color and it is gorgeous. the fit was perfect...very flattering style. it can be dressed up or down depending on shoes and jewelry, or boots and a scarf! the detail of the scalloped v in the back is a beautiful addition. perfect for the holidays or even dinner out with friends! beautiful dress!",5
Perfect for summer nights. makes any outfit that much special!,5
"This dress is magical. i wore it to a christmas party and felt like the belle of the ball. my dress swirled around me as i spun on the dance floor. later, i spilled a tequila-ginger all over the front. i was devastated, but it almost instantly dried and there are no stains!!! you can't even tell i spilled! it is hand-washable, which is great as well! i am 4'11 and 100lbs. the xxsp fit like a glove.

highly recommend! any other dress would have been ruined but this one was literally magical.",5
This dress is even better in person! the attention to detail and craftsmanship are amazing. i received compliments all night from total strangers.,5
This skirt is perfect! it just pulls on and lays nice and smooth. the fabric is soft and just the right thickness and stretch. i wore it with black tights and knee high boots for new year's eve and had many compliments! it runs a tad big. i am about 130lb and the small fits great although a tad larger than i would have expected. i assume it might srink in the wash a little anyway. my new favorite!,5
I just bought this dress today and i'm in love! i can't wait for the wedding i am wearing it to so i can wear it to other fun things too! looks even more amazing in heels.,5
"Ordered this dress and still haven't recieved it, but went to my local store today and tried it on in the size i ordered. it was too big. and now i can't get it in my size. so that stinks! quality was good and the dress was comfortable with stretch. i know in going to have to return it once it comes!",5
"This sweater is a dream come true for me. when i first spotted it during the 40% off sale, i didn't place my order in time to receive one. but then it came back a few weeks later, and i snatched one up! needless to say, the disappointment and wait was well worth it.

the material is incredibly soft, the fit is just about right (i'm a size xs at retailer, without fail, and this was probably the snuggest fit out of all the tops i have).

a few other reviews says that it runs big because of all the e",5
"Love everything about this dress! it's true to size , flows nicely, great quality. it's just amazing.",5
"This dress is beautiful - the pictures do not do it justice. i love the fabric and overall feel of the dress - light and airy. i have very broad shoulders and i did not feel like it look good on me so i am sending it back. too bad for me! i think the dress is perfect for weddings, parties and even everyday wear.",5
"The fabric of this dress is absolutely gorgeous from the design to the colors. i usually wear a size large in most retailer clothing, but i ordered this is l and xl because these dresses tend to disappear fast in the larger sizes. i ended up keeping the xl cause the buttons pulled across the chest on the l. this dress has a slim cut, and i would say if you have a small bust and are slender, this runs true to size. if you have a larger chest, size up because this is the type of dress you want to fl",5
"I wore this dress to a baby shower. it fit nicely and i received many compliments. i liked the weight, it flowed while walking and it was quite sweet.",5
Love this dress. purchased in white. runs true to size. made well.,5
"Walked in intending to purchase another jacket and ended up leaving with this one. the color is advertised as grey, but it's actually more like a light mocha. the slightly darker fabric on the side and around the waist accentuated my curves and i believe it would help give the illusion of an hourglass figure to those who are more straight and slender. i generally wear a size 12 and m or l size tops depending on the designer. i purchased the l in this case because that's all that was available at",5
Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha,1
"Waist is tight and thighs and legs are not. -not flattering- ankle opening is too small, and they have a funny smell.",1
"I love this top but make sure to size down! i am usually a small in blouses and the size s was like a tent! returned for an xs. overall, the fabric is a great quality and the colors are stunning. the orange isn't too harsh. a keeper for sure!",5
"I like the warm neutral color of this piece and the figure-skimming shape with waist definition. it is a soft and warm layering piece. sadly, the sleeves were too long for me and have long zippers at the cuffs so rolling them up didn't work. i wish i had caught this piece while they still had my size in petite!",5
"This is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse, which i also ordered. it's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse. it added 20 pounds! the print is beautiful. the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail. i ordered size large and am well endowed. steer clear if you have a bust.",1
Love this top. ..especially the back. the back makes the whole top.,5
"This dress is gorgeous! the store only had a size 12, so i am waiting for my size 8 to arrive. very pretty navy color. 
super cute. love all the embroidery detail. my niece is getting married in june and i can't wait to wear it!.
i normally wear a 6 or 8. judging by the fit, i think the 8 will be perfect.",5
"This is a really unique jacket. the suede-like darker fabric is so soft and brings great character to the jacket. i love the neutral color and the fit is true to size. the only minor complaint i have is that the band at the bottom of the jacket flares out a little, making it wider and a little odd looking. but i have learned to ignore this because all of the other features are so awesome! would recommend.",5
I'm always scared of rompers because of my height and long legs. but this one was perfect. it didn't ride up or hit in a weird spot on the hips. it's very flattering.,5
"This top is absolutely gorgeous! it fits true to size to slightly large. i'd say size down if you are between sizes. it has a nice weight to it - not too heavy, but for a winter season top - it is not too thin. colors are as pictured. i can pair this with black pants or with skinny jeans. it is a top that i will wear for years to come.",5
"I love this jumpsuit! i ordered it unsure, but i am so glad i did! it is super comfy and fit perfectly. i loved the length...can dress up or down. it is super flattering as well as i am curvy on the bottom and was told i looked ""trim"". my mom, friends, and complete strangers complimented me when i wore this...and that's when you know you scored.",5
"Ordered this online in a petite 4. (i'm 5'3""/130#). fits very nicely but for the amount of fabric this dress has (3 layers total), i think a 2p will be a better choice and not look as full, maybe a little more fitted, which will be more attractive at the top on me.

however, the detailing on the dress is really beautiful and high quality. the dress has quite a bit of weight to it with the top swingy layer, a tulle like layer for shape and then the sheath like slip. the colors are all very dark",5
"Love this striped top! it's perfect to throw on with black skinnies and a denim jacket or long grey cardigan. it also pairs well with camel. it is super soft. runs big imo, even though other reviewers said small. like most bordeaux, i took an xs, whereas i wear a small in most other retailer brands. similar to the photo, although much looser on me.",5
"This jacket has been a fun addition to my wardrobe. it has a very cute fit, and i like that it pulls in a bit at the sides to give it a form fitted look. best of all it stretches well despite the form fit; you can cross your arms or raise them up and you don't feel like your movement is restricted. i really like the soft suede-like material on the inside of the arms and the sides of the jacket. it fits true to size. can be worn casual or dressed up a bit. highly recommend!",5
"I'm seriously in awe of this fun dress! the beading, fuzzy flowers and embroidery on the peachy dress make me very happy. it's nice to wear by itself with a simple necklace but i love it more with my cropped jackets--my dark denim for a casual air or the tailored tuxedo black for date night! like others have said, this dress has many layers and is surprisingly heavy. definitely not for hot humid weather or i'd melt and cry. 


thank you so much to the reviewer who advised sizing up for the ar",5
"Stunning, beautiful, elegant, comfortable and all silk!  the print is very mesmerizing, as are all the hemant & nandita pieces i own.  i'm shocked that there aren't more reviews.  i found this fit perfectly on my body, skimming over my flaws and keeping my temperature moderate.  i am 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and purchased size mp.  please retailer, offer the other versions of this dress as shown on the uk retailer site.",5
I love this with skinny jeans! it is comfortable and soft. it fits well.,5
Can be dressed up or down. details are pretty without being gaudy. i got an 00p which fits well - i can wear it with a belt to give it some shape too. love it!,5
This is such a cute jumper! i bought it to wear to a beach wedding. i took a chance trying on a medium (i'm a true large) and was pleasantly surprised by how well it fit! very excited to add this to my spring/summer repertoire!,5
"I am 5'4, so i feel i'm on the cusp of petite/regular sizing. i ordered 2p, (about 125-130lbs), and the dress fit perfectly. it's so pretty (i got blue), i ordered this for my upcoming trip for our anniversary...i feel like i can wear with sandals or heels, with leggings or no leggings. beautifully made. kind of pricey, but worth it.",5
"I received tons of compliments on this adorable jumper and felt like i was wearing comfy pajamas. i wore it to a baby shower and it was a hit. i'm 5'4"" and it was a bit long and needed to be hemmed, otherwise it's perfect!",5
"I originally ordered this top in the black and it's been on back order for a month. i decided to go ahead and try the wine and i am so glad that i did!  the fit is flattering with a longer peplum to accommodate my long torso, the fabric is a nice mid weight with a very subtle brocade  pattern. the back of the neck has a classic zipper detail. the bell sleeves are not too long and the color is gorgeous for fall/winter. i highly recommend this top for all body types.",5
I just bought this dress on the half off sale price which is practically a steal and i must say i absolutely adore it! it runs pretty tts but all they had available was one size up from my usual 6 so i bought the 8 and it fits just fine (34d-27-35). the color is beautiful and the look of the dress is very vintage 30's/40's and so cute. i didn't find the sleeves to stick out at all on me so maybe i just got lucky and the print is just adorable on this. i highly recommend!,5
This top fits great. maybe a tad on the large side but not enough to go down a size. i love the fit. the bell sleeves and peplum are so flattering. definitely worth the price too!,5
"I am loving these new leggings and i dont even surf. i just wear them to the gym and at home and to run errands with a cute tunic top etc... they make me feel sunny and happy :) fabric is light and flexible but stays in place (went running in them) size is accurate, i am usually a 2 on retailer pants/skirts, 27 on jeans, and the small was perfect.",5
"I love wearing my boatneck pullover. the unique part of this item is the back with buttons. the shirts appears to be inside out, however, its not. its soft, comfortable, stylish and warm. i really like how it's longer in the back.",5
"These pants are very comfortable i love putting my phone and wallet in the front big pocket so cool the linen is soft fits great
the tie dye is very unique love it!",5
"Fit and flare, pullover style that can easily be dressed up or down. wish other colors were available online!",5
"I absolutely adore peplum tops, although some of them are made for individuals with short torsos. this one is beautifully designed with a long torso and flowing wrists. there is a nice balance between the fitted torso and then the flowing peplum and sleeves. the best thing of all is the fabric, which is a stretchy mid-weight jacquard. it is easy to get on, with a zipper in the back. i am sure i will get a lot of use out of this as the weather turns cooler and i plan on pairing it with pencil ski",5
"Tried it on at the store. (must of been a return) at first i wasn't thrilled with this dress.. have a little bit of a pouch and would never think i could wear a tight dress like this. the cut was perfect for that imperfect belly. went to a 5 hour dinner that night and was so comfortable. not itchy and i felt very pretty in it. husband loved it and was happy for me to show my curves again. would not of ordered this online, so glad it was in store. much more vibrant in person . try it you will lik",5
"I am not a fan of sweater dresses and did not pay attention to this one when looking at it on-line. however, it immediately caught my attention in a store, i decided to put it on and the dress looked amazing. soft, warm, skin hugging material, long skinny sleeves and more importantly, i looked amazing in this dress.i think colors are more vibrant, design is more lively in person than in picture. i am 5'10'' 145lb, so i loved that intricate dress pattern, broken lines in front made me not look li",5
"This dress looks amazing on-line. in person the arm ruffles are much larger and stick out, and the dress at the bottom makes you look like strawberry shortcake. too much all over ruffling at the chest and is not flattering. pattern is dizzying in person. 

very thin multi layer dress. should be better material and quality for this price. save your money and shipping.",1
Very pleased with this vibrant and colorful sweater dress. the color combinations are very beautiful and it seems as if the threads used have an inherent shimmer. the fit is body skimming without highlighting trouble spots. i am a m/l on top and a s/m on bottom and the size medium fits perfectly. the cut adds the illusion of proportion to my disproportionate body. there are some problems but workable: slip is sewn-in which i wish was detachable; the scoop neck is too low for my 36ddd bust; weave,5
"Lightweight, soft cotton top and shorts. i think it's meant to be a beach cover-up but i'm wearing it as a thin, light-weight summer outfit on these hot hot days. the top has a loose elastic around the bottom which i didn't realize when i ordered it, but i like it and it matches the look in the photos. and the shorts are very low-cut - don't expect them up around your waist. again, i like that. some might want to wear a cami underneath because it's a thin cotton but i'm fine as-is. i bought it i",5
"I got the shirt, the cami, and the shorts and they are all great. super comfortable fabric, really well made, and really cute. love them all!",5
Love the fit and feel of these. and super stylish too. i want in more colors if i can get it.,5
"I love this peasant top! i didn't expect it to be made from such nice fabric. usually, i have to wear a camisole under a lot of retailer tops, but not this one! i bought a petite xs and if fits perfectly. thank you to retailer for selling petite clothes.",5
"I just purchased this at my local retailer..the online pix does not do it justice! so pretty & delicate..casual, comfortable fitting..hits right at the hips...",5
These run so small!! i was dissapointed with having to return my pair. i'm hoping they are replenished back in stock so i can get the proper size.,5
"I ordered both the black & the dark grey, the dark grey arrived first! they are very comfortable & flattering! there is a nice thigh slimming effect. i purchased the size small, regular length & they hit me at my ankle (5,5"", 130lbs), i can't wait for the second pair to arrive!",5
"I've been looking for the right leggings that are of good quality, thick enough to feel appropriately covered, and a good price point - these are those leggings! need more!",5
"I'd describe these as a hybrid pant/legging. they are very comfortable flattering, and versatile. i got the large because medium was sold out, but they fit nice, not super tight.",5
"A whim of a purchase on a tops sale. i spotted the black, but went for the mauve. it's great in person, fits loosely and hangs nicely for layering. i will buy the black too when in goes on sale. 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame, and the small was perfect (and every a little roomy) on me.",5
"Great fabric.  nice legging, substantial fabric, more structured than a typical legging.",5
"Originally ordered a large but it was huge. the medium fit perfectly. i'm 165lbs, 5'7"". lovely material and interesting side details. the sides do come up quite high but a camo or tank underneath does the trick. lots of compliments!!",5
This blouse is gorgeous on i purchased at my local store i noticed it was $29.99 + 30% = $21.00 omg it's so nice on it's soft and comfortable and the gold threading make it sunning it does run a little small in the chest area,5
"This shirt is a very cute dressed up casual kind of top. the lace detail in the front and the back make a plain, long sleeve black top look elegant. the material on the shirt is pretty light, so it is for fall or spring.",5
"Love this top. the material is so comfy yet it looks dressy. great for a night out with black pants or a skirt. i'm 5ft8inches, 38-27-38 and a small fit perfectly which seems true to retailer sizing. flattering yet hides a little post holiday belly. i wore a nude rackerback bra with the top, and that works perfectly with the design.",5
"Great pair of black pants, a step up from basic leggings. nice weight and a little ribbed detail on the sides. would recommend.",5
"This is the little black dress i've been looking for for years -- great slim fit (runs small -- i usually get sized out but the 00 was a snug fit), eye-catching design. like the other reviewer, i think solid black panels rather than floral brocade would have been classier, but overall a chic dress.",5
"Perfect fit, nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out
after wearing for a short time. good lines in back so they are more
dressy than a regular legging.",5
"I love this top, the details at the neck and shoulders are lovely, both front and back. it's also very comfortable and soft, allowing you look nicely dressed while feeling like you are wearing a soft tee-shirt. the sleeves are a good length with some elastic at the cuffs so you can push them up. sadly, it's sold out in in my size online and in the stores, otherwise i would certainly snap it up at the sale price.",5
"This top is beautiful online and in person. i am in no way a large full figured gal, but i did order an xl. reading the past review and wanting an airy fit i ordered a larger size. this shirt is horribly tiny in person! the xl regular fit looked like an xs. have no idea if this particular shirt sent to me was miss sized or what. will take back. other than fit, the shirt is very beautiful in every way.",1
"They are a perfect thickness. fits comfortably like leggings but look like a nice pair of office/ outside pant. got them in the grey, am thrilled w the texture. i typically wear a large in pants and they are tts. not see through either. would definitely recommend them.",5
"All the colors are beautiful, the white is a true white. i got the gray one. it runs large, so i would recommend sizing down, unless you plan on layering using thicker fabrics underneath.",5
"I love design of this top! it will look beautiful on many body types. the black material is thin, and for my personal level of comfort i will definitely wear a cami under. the details are gorgeous and the neutral colors easy to combine with casual or dressy bottoms. the top ran true to size for me.",5
"I opened these when i got them yesterday and immediately tried them on. the knees were totally stretched out and due to the panel at the knee, it looked like i had growths popping out between my legs at my knees. someone had received these before me and sent them back after they tried them on or wore them then returned them. they were obviously too small for whoever did that. these never should have been resent to another customer. they are obviously very misshapen. they are going back. on a bet",1
This shirt is so stunning. the photo does this shirt no justice. what you can't see from the image are the tiny gold threads that are woven throughout the shirt. they run vertically.and are very subtle and seen only up close. so pretty. also the detail in the chest area is perfect. i love this shirt.,5
"For an athro top, this is a good price point, especially for such a beautiful piece. it's really just a basic tee, but the lace insets bring it up several notches. and it's much prettier than the picture shows. i think it fits very true to size -- i'm normally a size small and got that size with this (34d, 124 lbs., 5'4"", 36-26-35.). although the lace is very sheer, i really couldn't see my nude bra through it, so don't feel i'll need a cami, because that would ruin the delicate design of this.",5
"I think this is the first peasant top i've found that doesn't fit like a tent! i did size down to a small, although i'm normally between small and medium. i even found that the shape of this top is quite flattering. maybe the darker embroidery helps. i'm very happy with this purchase.",5
Soooooo cute. fit like a dream. look like regular pants. could dress up or dress down. i bought the grey and the slight herringbone pattern was so adorable. going to buy in the black as well. normally wear size 4-6 got the small and fits perfect.,5
Love this piece! lots of versatility and the pattern is lovely. wear it alone or with leggings and boots.,5
"I bought this top for my mom for christmas. i wasn't sure if she would like it, but it is really nice in person and she loved it. it fit true to size and can be dressed down, as it is on the model, or dressed up. i am so glad i decided to get this top. highly recommend.",5
I love this shirt. wore it today and got many compliments. i bought the mauve (looks lilac to me). it's very comfy and long. its got a lovely swing feel which is great for covering my baby belly.,5
This is perfection in the color sky. get you one now. you will not regret it. it is super soft and flattering!,5
Probably the most comfortable jeans i have ever owned. they are more comfortable even than yoga leggings. they look and fit like real jeans while feeling like loungewear. i have nothing negative to say about them.,5
"This dress is as cute as represented in the picture. the adjustable ties on the sides allow your dress to be form fitting or a looser, more casual look. the colors of the dress and the beading are beautiful. the dress looks great paired with a pair of black ankle boots!",5
"Awesome fabric, wonderfully flattering cut. love the blue and green colors.",5
"I live in blue jeans - and i'm extremely particular about style, fit, and fabric. an eternal fan of ag, i tried these on the recommendation of a sales association. in the past week - i've dressed them up, dressed them down, and wished i could wear them to work! the wash is an especially versatile shade of indigo. incredibly flattering fit. if you're going to splurge on one essential this season...these paige jeans are definitely a candidate.",5
This is a beautiful dress. i love the bohemian style and flow. works well with dressing up or dressing down. very quality.,5
I have two pair of these jeans. one at the original length for heels and one hemmed for flats. i'm ordering another pair because i wear them constantly.,5
So easy to put on for a casual day!  washes great!,5
"I saw this online yesterday and i was in the store today to try it on. i assumed it would look average or below average on me and i could just walk away no problem. by no means am i in the financial bracket to be spending this much money on a jumpsuit, yet here i am at home wearing it as i write this review. it is surprisingly flattering. i am 5 feet tall and have a petite frame so wide leg pants never work on me, but this somehow did without making me look bulky. given my height, it comes to ab",5
"I received this coat as a 30th birthday present from my mother and i have to say, this is the best present she has ever bought me. the inside of the jacket is the softest sheerling i've felt and is pure bliss to wear around town. the coat is actually a lot warmer then i expected, which i'm not going to complain about. the print is lovely and i appreciate the faux leather edge on the cuffs, giving it a more finished look. the fit is fantastic. i'm a bit curvy and the cinched waist with the belt g",5
"I'm in love. the cut, fit, and fabric of this jean have made it my favorite, everyday pair. they're mostly rayon, followed by equal parts polyester and cotton with a touch of spandex thrown in: the right combination for fit, softness, and durability. these hold their shape well, so i don't have to wash them every other time i wear them. the ankle length hits me at the top of my ankle bone. perfect. i'm 5'6"", 125 pounds. ordered size 27.",5
"This is an absolutely beautiful dress, but arrived with several holes in it!",1
"I've been shopping with retailer over 10 years and this is my first review. i almost didn't order after reading negative reviews from petite ladies. i'm 5' 2"" and these jeans are perfection! they look amazing with a 2-3 inch heel. i don't think they are meant to wear with flats since petite people look ridiculous in flats with boot cut or wide leg anyway. love these!",5
"I ordered this dress online in 8 p in the orange color. the length was perfect but the dress seemed big. it was a lot of dress. so i went into the store and tried on a regular 6, but the dress was a little long. they didn&#39;t have petite in stock so they had it shipped to me and it fit perfectly! i am 5&#39;3 and 150 pounds. i don&#39;t think this dress would work if you have a big bust, i&#39;m a 36b so it fits nicely around the chest area. the length of the dress was also perfect!",5
Classy tunic can be worn with jeans or leggings. neckline is small but stretches so it goes on easily. color is perfect for spring. my only word of caution.....the design can add a bit of bulk around the middle so probably not your best bet if you are tummy conscious.,5
"My favorite shirt!!! i wear it when i don't want to be in the sun too long, it has breathable material in the armpit. i loved so much ordered in other colors. i wish they would make in more colors!",5
"Really pretty color, light, breathable fabric and i love the high neck on this tunic! i wear this tunic with black leggings, a black tank and black sandals. i'm not the smallest girl so i love that this tunic is a bit longer and has a bit of a belt. wonderful pick up!",5
"This looks awesome with leggings / jeggings and booties or slip ons. great buy. its a wee big, but there are slits up the sides pretty high.",5
"I absolutely love this jacket! it's one of the best things i've bought this season. the interior is so unbelievably soft. i just want to wrap myself in it with nothing but a tank top on underneath so i can really feel the texture against my skin. the fit is beautiful, as is the pattern. it's even better in person than in the photo. it is pricey, but for the longevity and pleasure that i can imagine myself getting out of it, it's well worth it.",5
"I wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun, but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline",1
"Adorable skirt! thought it would be snug so ordered up, but had to send back and re-order in normal size. fits perfect. found it to be slimming on the backside, yay! :) this will be a wardrobe staple for many years to come!",5
"In the fall, i purchased every single color of the left of center swing top. long sleeve, great colors and very easy to wear. when i saw these, i swooned. these are very similar knit to the left of center, but the swing is bigger and the linen insets on the side make this easy top even more beautiful! these run true to size...basically you are only fitting your arms and chest. this top will definitely has a little give with wear, which will just add to the shape and effortlessness. the linen ins",5
"I love this shirt - beautiful casual wear, great with jeans!",5
Highly recommend these jeans! they are ultra-soft and fit your body like a dream. the wash is flattering on them as well. i was looking for a pair of jeans to be my go to and ultimately landed on these. they do runa little big but they do not stretch out much so i went with my usual size.,5
"I have received several compliments when wearing this sweater. perfect to dress up or dress down. purchased it in black and red. does run on large. i am 5'3"" roughly 110 lbs ordered an xs.",5
"Side slit goes up far when seated so beware, wear on a non bloated day ;)
but very comfy and unforced sexified
wore it with a fluffy sweater, lots of looks",5
"Hi , i bought these in moss for both of my daughters. they love them. the material is substantial and washes beautifully. the fit is straight up and down and is not forgiving on figure flaws. i would recommend this to a thin figured girl.",5
"I was extremely disappointed with the quality of this product. as soon as i put this tunic, the right tie loop detached from the garment. i could return it but the point of shopping online was to avoid the hassle of going to the store. the price of the item does not justify the low quality of the final product.",1
"This is such a pretty top. i do not feel it runs big, as another review mentioned. to fit the sleeves comfortably (i do not have large arms at all) i did choose to take a small over my usual xs so the body is a bit llonger than shown on the model (a bit more of a tunic fit on me). it is really a pretty top either way, the xs fitting like it does in the picture on the model and the s fitting a bit longer. worried just a bit that it might develop holes as some tissue tees do.",5
I'm in love with this print! the fabric feels wonderful- this is such a perfect transition dress! the adjustable waist tie makes the dress fit great!,5
These are literally the most comfortable and the softest jeans i have ever owned. i just got them a few weeks ago and i'm already obsessed with them. they have the perfect amount of stretch that makes them flattering and comfortable but they don't stretch out like all my other jeans do. i ordered my usual size 28 and they fit great! can't recommend these enough!,5
"I love everything about this tunic dress. it's versatile and can be styled a few ways: loose like a shift, blouson when cinched, or eliminate the liner and wear as a layer over whatever you want. all the little details make it stand out and give it a glamorous bohemian vibe. there are tiny beads, sequins and subtle micro pleating. the fabric is airy and quite delicate (be careful.) the drawstrings at the waist are adjustable for both sides. slip is tts and the outer dress has a subtle oversize d",5
"If you already own at least one of the four versions of the morning glory dress, then you will know what size of the canna swing dress to buy. sleeves are slightly full with button closures. slip is tts and the outer dress is huge! easy to cinch if you want a fit & flare style. just know what you like--complainers about how baggy this dress is are forewarned. those who really want to size down are slim/slender/petite types. if you don't want to wear the tent-like swing style, size down one or tw",5
"Just received yesterday & i love this skirt! it's crazy soft, very flow-y and the higher slits on each side let it be more sexy than hippie-looking which i appreciate. great to pair with a funky pair of tights underneath. sits nicely on your body - hugs your curves.

only annoyance is it's a bit awkward to walk in as the material moves around your legs & gets caught a bit. you definitely have to be conscious of it as you walk.

i bought a m in gray which fit perfectly (i'm 5'9"" & usually a 6). t",5
"This tunic is true to size, i ordered the xxs as i am 5'5"", 110 lbs. it fit perfectly and hit me about 4 inches above the knee. similar to model photo (i have long torso). it has a very sparingly done cluster of sparkle sequence. the draw string waist has a tie on each side to adjust length. i actually returned it only because it seemed a little to young a look for me. i was sorry to do so.",5
"I tell everyone i know to try these jeans, that they are so worth the price tag. i've been an ag super fan for years, but i fell in love with paige the moment i tried these on. (i still love ag for their colored and patterned ankle denim and cords.) i have worn these over 50 times without ever having to wash them. (i never understood the idea that you're not supposed to wash denim, but now i realize that it's feasible.) they don't stretch out and still hug me like a second skin - without feeling",5
"This is a very sexy skirt. very slimming...a great basic long skirt to have in your wardrobe. dress it up or down.
the slits are high, so you are exposed like a short shirt.",5
"These paige skinny jeans are lightweight, snug, super soft and extremely flexible allowing for tons of movement. great for dressing up or down and a great addition to any ladies closet.",5
This color is gorgeous. this could be dressed up or down. great buy!,5
I just received this dress wadded up in a bag. it is nothing like the colors shown on line. in the picture it appears blue and white. in actuality it is teal and a funky color of beigey pink. the top is see though but it does see have a slip under the skirt. will be sending it back and again remind myself why i shouldn't try to buy a dress on line.,1
"These are very cute but very, very stiff. have washed 3x and still not relaxing. not a bad thing but they are a little uncomfortable the first hour of wear. my waist is smaller and generally, have gap in waist to get fit right in hips. super cute with sandals, mules, duck boots.",5
"As a dancer and yoga enthusiast i have tried my fair share of leggings. these are probably the best i've ever found. pure + good makes top quality, well fitting leggings that do not slide down, shift around, or become see-through regardless of the physicality of your movement. they breathe wonderfully and have survived one washing with no ill-effects. they are high enough in the rise that i never have to worry about revealing anything i don't want, nor do i constantly have to adjust them to keep",5
"My new favorite cozy and stylish ""go-to"" piece for everything from park with the kiddos to mat class to impromptu financial meetings.",5
This jacket is stylish and unique. love the lines and the fit is very flattering.coral is a bit more orange/dk. peach than what i think of as typical coral. fun color for spring. i sized up from my typical s to m.,5
Love this tank! it's super soft and has a lovely drape. i got 3 colors on sale and am so glad i did!,5
"The peach color is beautiful on this jacket, and the quality and comfort is perfect. i wear a medium and the sizing was spot-on. i may get in another color if a sale comes around again.",5
"Super soft and stylish. it's a major step up from my overly casual fleece jackets. love it. i think the sizing is dead on so i would disagree with a review that it runs small. i'm 5'10 and 142lbs. typically wear a size s, but sometimes have to size up to a m. i got a s. fits great. not too tight. sleeves are plenty long enough. i typically wear this with skinny jeans to work (aka grad school), and i like that it functions as a jacket on chilly mornings, but its not too bulky so i can keep it on",5
"I ordered the xxs, i think retailer has gone on the bigger size again and i went from small to xs to xxs... so true to size in that sense. i love the color (nude), and it is pretty soft and comfortable. the cut is flattering, the cowl neck is pretty, the sleeves are shorter, and the hem is wider (aka swing). this would look totally adorable with my flare or wide leg jeans. i think ti would look nice too with skinnies, if you have leaner legs.

(for reference, 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs)",5
"This is what i'd been looking for without even knowing it! it's long without being too long, and most importantly - its soft, not scratchy the way so many winter clothes can be. i wasn't sure if i should order the small or the medium so i went with the medium, and it fits great. the weave is just slightly wide, but not to the point where you have to wear a cami or tee underneath, but the fit is loose enough that you can, if you want to for added warmth. i really like it.",5
The shirt fits true to size. the length of the top is great: not too short (won't show your midrift when you raise your arms) not too long (this is a shirt not a dress). this is a great top for a casual day in jeans or a flirty day with skirt to dress it up.,5
This dress is one of a kind! i saw it on sale and immediately snatched it for a very reasonable price. i could not be happier. i've already had the chance to wear it at an event and felt like miss mary from downton abby. very classy and elegant.,5
This top is gorgeous in person! i'm in love with it! it's perfect for the holiday season. it runs a little big and long so i suggest going down a size for a more tailored fit.,5
"Love, love, love! wish i had gotten this in every color. the absolute most perfect tank with just the right amount of flow. i am 5'3 with 34d chest and the medium is great.",5
Great jacket for a cool morning. not too heavy and i found it to run true to size. nice little details.,5
"This tank is wonderful for those with full hips because it hangs just right to cover any flaws. the colors are bright and the material is soft. there is a band at the end that elevates the tank so you can wear it out if you would like. not too low in the front and overall the tank runs true to size. i suppose if you wanted a tighter fit you could size down 1 size, but i like the way it hangs in my regular size. i'm very busty and hippy and this top makes both look slim. highly recommend.",5
"I just got it in the mail and i love it! very versatile piece. wear with skinny jeans and heels or tucked into a skirt. i usually wear a size small but went with what the other review said about a small being tailored and got the medium so i could tuck the front into jeans. i am 5'5"" ,125lbs , a 32dd and wear a size 4 or 27 in jeans.",5
"I bought this tank to wear with the pilcro linen wide leg pants in navy. what a great outfit! this tank is very flowy, but not overly large, and hangs beautifully over pants. it's casual, yet can be worn under a nice sweater or jacket and look great. i bought the white and had no issues with transparency when i wore a nude colored bra. i bought it in s and could've gone with an xs but didn't want it to be tight. i'm going back to my local retailer store today to buy it in at least one other color.",5
"Had the same inconsistent sizing issue in coral as miss janeausten. i ordered 2 corals, one in s & one in xs & the s was very much smaller than the xs as i could barely get my arms into the s (while my arms were loose in the xs). keeping the ""larger than s"" xs coral - the color is just lovely. also ordered the ivory in both ps & pm & keeping the pm as i like the longer arm length to cover my hands (for sun protection when i want/need). because you can cinch the waist tightly, a looser jacket sti",5
"I am 5'4"", 170lbs, 34dd and a medium fits beautifully in this top. the mint green is very pretty, and a nude bra under it works without showing and without it being see-thru. it is super soft and pretty, and doesn't cling. i love it!",5
"I just received them (blue) and wore them today. i got so many compliments! they are comfy and very flattering. i would not call the fabric cheap at all. it is super soft and washes and wears nicely. i ordered the medium and they fit perfectly, even though i am on the large side of medium. i'm ordering the other color right now!",5
"I purchased both the coral and cream. the coral is more rustic than vibrant and to me, more orange than a true coral. but for summer, is probably super cute. i found this ran large. for reference, i am 5'8'' 128lbs and purchased a small, my usual size in retailer. i kept the small in the cream but if i were to keep the coral, i would have sized down to xs. you can adjust a little, but the arms were loose and coral didn't look as good if not fitted. super cute with jeans and a tee, with yoga pants,",5
"I'm: 34a, 125 lbs, 5'8""
purchased: small

jacket fits well and is not too heavy. didn't feel tight in the arms. great to wear on a cool spring day! i bought the white and grey jacket.",5
This is a great shirt but it was big for its size. i'm also short so maybe the petite size would have fit me better,5
"This caught my eye in the store last week, and i decided to try it on. it's the perfect lightweight jacket. the photos here show it as activewear, but i think the details on it allow it to be much more versatile. it's very flattering and i found it to run true to size.",5
I ordered the orange color too. these are perfect for throwing on over workout clothes and then running errands.,5
"Great top, lately i've been sizing down from my usual xs to xxs with pure & good tops, but in this one the xs was best. i bought this in 3 colors and they're my go to tanks for summer. the mint is a bit sheer, but not bad. i did not get try the yellow or white one.",5
"Bummed out.. this is super cheaply made and very expensive... the design is different , the color is beautiful, but the material is a different story.. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks.. not 128.. i'm returning them. also, they run very big..!",1
"This is the perfect simple tank for summer. not clingy, and hangs really nicely, but not so billowy that you can't layer a nice wrap or cardigan over it. fabric feels like a great quality. i got it in white, and it's a bit sheer, but i typically layer my tanks anyway. tempted to get this in every color!",5
"Love this tank. it's nice and loose and looks great with all kinds of bottoms. it's very forgiving if you have a midsection. it's soft, and great colors. really nice for spring casual looks.",5
"Bought this in the turquoise color and it is awesome. for those worried about it being see-through, i'm wearing a black bra and you can't see it. it's the perfect weight. super bummed that the green is sold out but may check in stores.",5
The colors are beautiful,5
"I bought this on sale and at the sale price it is a steal. great style, feel, and fit. maybe wouldn't feel as good about it at full price, but wish i had one is every color!",5
"I ordered both the green and the pink and needed the extra extra small petite in the shirt to make it work for me 
 nice light material cute fit 
 unfortunately didn't like the pink color was too bright for me  ( and although i ordered an extra extra small petite they sent me an extra small petite which is just slightly too big )and saw the mango in the store which i also didn't like the color",5
"I first got the coral one and was so in love with it that i ended up getting the other colors. it's just so cute, flattering, so cute with a long necklace and i just love how the back dips down and covers your butt. i've been heavily contemplating getting a second coral one i'm so worried if something happens to it lol i'm weird like that. it's always the good stuff that can't be replaced",5
This product is perfect for early fall wear. when the weather is a little cooler a shell worn under it will be fabulous,5
"I'm 5'5 130 lbs and tried this on a small at my store and then ordered it in a small petite. i like the petite better even though there isn't much of a difference, the petite is about 28 inches long. it still covers the bum but i was hoping to wear it with shorts and i think it's too long for that. i love the beautiful coral color, received a compliment on the color the first time i wore it. the quality is superb. the only downside is i don't like the way it looks when zipped, it doesn't give mu",5
"I am so glad that i ordered this top. it is kind of shimmering and looks so pretty in person! it is nicely lined and i love the sweetheart shape at the front. i am 5'2"", 34b, broad shoulder, ordered size s and m, and they both fit quite nicely. the size s is more like a trailered fit on me, while the size m gives more room for my arms and shoulder, also extra length that i can tuck it in my low-raise demin. i ended up keeping size m since i like my tops to fit a bit more flowy. i can see myself",5
I live in a hot and humid climate so this tank is perfect for everyday use. you can dress it up or down and the lightweight material keeps you cool. i bought it in 2 colors and may go back for more. i wish i would have found them sooner.,5
I just received this jacket in the cream color. it is so cute! you can change it from 3/4 to full length sleeves. i ordered both an xs and s and kept the s after i saw that i could cinch the waist to fit better. in the picture it looks a bit boxier than it really is possibly because not cinched. the material is good quality and the jacket is complete with attention to detail from the buttons to the jean contrast pull on the zipper. i love this jacket! it is a good cross over from athletic to cas,5
"I'm glad i listened to my instincts once again regarding maeve maxidress. the stretchiness of this knit jersey fabric allows me to comfortably size down from my usual medium/large since the fabric relaxes so much as you wear it. i adore the color, pattern, slim profile and cut in arm holes. wearing this makes my short self feel statuesque and sofisticated.",5
So pretty & comfortable! love it!,5
"I have several of these tanks from last year and bought new colors this year. i have found the fit to be easy and relaxed, but not baggy. they are very flattering. i wear them thru the fall and winter as layering pieces under sweaters and flannel shirts as well. i was them in cold water, delicate cycle, hang to dry and they are good to go. they have held up well - even the ones that are 2+ years old are still going strong with no holes or tears.",5
The uniqueness of this top caught my eye online. i normally wld not want a long sleeve top in the summer. a bit warm to wear outside now but i like the casual but unique style of it. it's a top i can wear now but only indoors with a/c. the regular small fits fine. a little oversized & sleeves a little long - as in the pic. the color/style/detaling is exactly as in the pic - no surprises. soft & comfy. a little opaque but a nude bra will work fine. i don't see the need for a tank/cami under it. i,5
"I bough this top in blue and i really like the color , style and fabric. i also bough the necklace as styled in the photo and they look well together. it's a departure from more tailored clothing for me. 
i keep on trying linen tops and up to now, this seems the best cut for linen. as the fabric stretches, it will still fall nicely.",5
"It runs large. loose or oversized tops don't bother me so i thought it would be fine, but this just made me look wider then i am. is thin and too sheer for me as well. it was just so unflattering. i had to return it.",1
"I ordered the moss green color. i love it! the color is really cool, the length is longer, and the fabric is soft. great summer option!",5
"Ordered online in white, just received it, love i! i wear m in most clothing, size 6 dress, jacket fits perfectly. would love one in the peach color shown in the pic but from the reviews stating it is much deeper in colour decided against it.",5
"I thought i would need a medium in this top, but it was sold out so i crossed my fingers on a small. it fits very well, much like it fits on the model.. loose and length is good ( and i am not as slender as that model!). i am 5'6"", 140 lbs). the sweetheart neckline dips a little more than i would like in the front....but i will figure that out. the top is really unique and i love the shimmery dots.",5
Love everything about this top.  the ruffles give the top a great edgy style.  will look great with some skinny jeans and boots.,5
"Love! this tank?everyone should own it in every color?it is soft, has a great shape, and is super cute. it goes great with so many of the pants/shorts from retailer as well. summer staple for sure.",5
"Great weekend toss around piece or with gym clothes.  the cut is flattering, yet not tight.  i purchased in 2 colos  b/c i liked it so much and was looking for a piece like this for a very long time! cute with yoga legging, jeans, sweats etc.",5
"Beautiful color, gorgeous chic design and great material",5
"I'm barely 5'4"" and rarely find a maxi that isn't far too long or the other extreme. i prefer mine to just barely reach the ground as opposed to rising 5 inches from the floor for example. this one is perfect with flat sandals. i tried on the 4 and chuckled b/c it was 6"" too long. tried on the 2 and not only was it the perfect length, the bodice fit like a glove. i would say i'm average bust size, always fluctuating but not generally flat-chested. i prefer more conservative sleeveless dresses an",5
Love this dress !!,5
"I really loved the dress in the picture. it is really
nice quality. unfortunately it was really long. i am
5'4 and it was about 8 inches too long. hemming it
would have ruined the details of the dress. they were
backordered on petites in my size ,so, i just returned it.",5
"Lovely material and the white is like a milky white which i love. it hangs beautifully, irons well and fits great. i am 5'-6, an a cup, 150 lbs and ordered the small. i've already received a lot of compliments on it.",5
"I loved the design and look to this shirt, but it ran way big for me. i loved the forgiving fit, but it just wasn't flattering at all. i even went down one size and it still was huge. sad to send this one back.",1
"Just received this in the mail, and i love it! the fit is wide and flowy, but i wouldn't say it runs large... i don't think i could have sized down in the shoulders. perfect easy, breezy fall top. cannot wait to wear it!",5
"Purchased the cream color in my local store. it looks great with jeans or leggings. i've worn it with a bright cami underneath with a couple of buttons open and it looked really cute too. it is very comfortable, runs big, but it's meant to not be fitted. the addition of pockets, (that don't stick out), makes me love it even more! i will be wearing this from fall to spring. great design, retailer!!!",5
This shirt is just precious! i cannot wait to pair it with a pair of white skinny jeans and wedges in the spring. i'm so in love with it. the detail is just beautiful.,5
"I ordered this online with fingers crossed, in my usual size m. it fits well, albeit a tad snug (although very flattering on my curvy frame). it is an unusual color for me, but i ended up loving it in person where you can really appreciate all the detailed woven patterns in the fabric. there is a slip underneath which ends several inches above the hem.",5
Seems there was a design defect in this item--sleeves are way too tight and hardly go on without ripping the shirt. i have pretty thin arms so it's hard to imagine this not happening on anyone. too bad because it's otherwise a very nice top.,1
"I am an retailer employee. i immediately fell in love with this dress. i tried it on and it was way to long, as always with regular store sizes...i am short 5'0"". i wanted to order but it was backordered for about a month, i ordered it anyway. my husband and i took a mini vacation to chicago over easter weekend and in the miracle mile store they had the dress in my petite size. i was in heaven as they had an awesome petite area in the store there. i purchased a 2 petite which is the size i",5
"I love this top! i actually didn't read the reviews prior and ordered a small. the retailer tag on mine says small, but the tag in the shirt is xs. it does run large, so the mix-up was fine by me. the style of the shirt is meant to be loose and light. i love it.",5
"I think this blouse looks better in real life than it does on line and i'm glad i decided to try it on. i bought an extra small in the red which i think is the best color. the white looks like a nightgown. too bad there were not more darker fall prints because i would have bought more than one. i think this style would look best on someone that is tall and thin. a petite person might get away with turning it into a dress. i would buy a longer version of this . as it is it is a fun, feminine casu",5
I love this dress! it flatters so nicely. i'm 5'3 and pretty thin. it hugs all my curves snugly.,5
Love this top. purchased for family photos and i think it's great. personally i don't think the model shot is doing it justice - it's much prettier in person. runs true to size for retailer. i am a 34d and i purchased a small.,5
"This tunic is perfection! this tunic will be perfect with jeans or leggings and can be dressed up or be worn casual. it does run big. i am normally a medium/large in shirts and took a medium with room to spare. i probably could have worn a small too, but smalls tend to be tight on my shoulders. this is a must buy!",5
"I am petite, 5'2, and i ordered the xxsp, i think it is so adorable on and looks great with skinny/slim pants or leggings. i do not think it runs that large, it is suppose to be loose and flowy and it looks on me exactly how it looks on the model. i got the gray print and it is quite pretty.",5
"I love the idea of this top and ordered it in white. it is a great design and proportion is nice with jeans. the front is off white t shirt material with a pocket and the back is a light grey heathered panel. i am returning it as it is very thin and the quality is cheap looking. if the grade of material had been a bit thicker and better made, then it would have been a winner!",1
"Great top for all seasons. hides imperfections, flatters hourglass shapes. and great thickness/weight to fabric. i'm wearing it to a concert with skinny moto jeans and booties! side zip is excellent feature and great quality.",5
"I love this tunic. purchased the dark orange in medium (i am 5'9 and 140 lbs). tried the small and almost kept it but i felt seams around my arm pits a tad, so went with the medium and glad i did - this top should be comfortable. feels very fall and perfect for casual get-togethers and running around town. only comment is that it is rayon... and for me anyway rayon doesn't wash too well - so we shall see how this one fairs.",5
"I bought this in a large, i'm normally an xl. it is a very large on the bottom. i really like that style so the extra fabric was good. i tried on the white and orange. the white is sheer and i didn't like the fabric as much. the orange way really cute though!",5
"Was surprised by the cute factor and great fit. the fabric is soft, it flows perfectly and isn't too long. it covers my rear. no gapping at the chest and i'm large busted. i got a large. the shirt is black and the florals in the pattern are a soft muted white. those little balls are small and more noticeable from the back. looks great under a jean jacket!",5
"I bought two of these in xs. i am 5'11 and 150lbs. i started with the size small but that was to big, so down to a size xs and that was perfect. the color ivory/white is really nice, is not see through (i wear nude bras) and it goes with everything. i also didn't see any loose strings falling out of it like another reviewer said...quality material. the burnt orange is really nice too, perfect for fall. love the pockets. just make sure you size down one or two. i am usually a size medium to a lar",5
"I love this dress! i'm 5'5"", and it's just long enough to be dramatic and graze my feet without dragging on the ground with flat sandals. the print is lovely and the beading is subtle. as some have mentioned, the neck is high. it's definitely noticeable, but i didn't find it uncomfortable.",5
Very different. i love the unique design and it is appropriate for various settings .,5
"This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling, it is going back for good. such a shame!",1
"I loved this dress and the color. i wanted to wear it to my niece's wedding. i usually wear a medium but couldn't get it on. the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks. the xl was perfect is the hips in that it didn't cut, but the top was huge. i really don't understand the sizing of this dress at all.",1
"This is not a kimono. it's a cocoon. there's a huge difference.

it's also not made very well.",1
This is an awesome shirt! gorgeous quality and design. can be dressed up or down! it runs slightly large i ordered a small. i would still order a small but if you are trying to decide between a small and an extra small i would get the extra small.,5
"My store got this great tunic in white and i loved it so much. perfect tunic length, swingy, detailed...but as soon as i saw the orange option i knew i had to wait for it. i just got it and im in love! the orange print is so lovely. the perfect fall color and the print is timeless. the fabric is light and easy. the fit is definitely bigger, but i usually wear a l or xl in retailer tops and i preferred the xl. i have a lot of curves so i love a top that has some room, but i needed the xl for room i",5
"It's sheer, the design /print is casual, but on silk like material. had it been made out of cotton would have definitely kept it! who is going to wear this in the blazing heat of summer???",1
"Great fit, wonderfully made, and priced just right.",5
"I bought the silvery blue tunic. it is very light grey with a hint of blue. it is so shapely - coverage without being boxy or maternity-like. it covers your bum perfectly and looks great with a dark pair of skinny jeans. the color can really take you through autumn, winter and even spring depending on where you live. i love the sleeve length, too.",5
I just received this dress and i'm glad i read previous reviews and ordered a size up. i normally wear an xs or s and ordered a medium it fits perfectly. the color is beautiful and the dress is unique. can't wait to find a special event to wear it.,5
This top is exactly as pictured and the fit is perfect. the knit is a nice quality and the embroidery is striking. i can't wait to wear it. it will look great with skinny jeans.,5
"Gorgeous dress, soft + silky material, and flattering on most body types. best purchase i've made at retailer in a long time, i get compliments every time i wear it!",5
"Love, love, love this top!!!  love the ruffled tiers at the bottom.  love the longer length. the top does indeed run large.  normally i'm between a medium and small but bought the xs.  love the pockets.  the orange color seems like a nicer fabric, and is versatile with both jeans and leggings.",5
"I was headed out of my local retailer store when i spotted this beauty! i had been looking for a dress/tunic like this for some time. i got the lovely soft grey/white combo and it is lovely on. normally an xl in tops from retailer the large in this holding horses tunic fit perfect! also a note for women with bigger arms and shoulders this should work well for you as this is usually a problem for me and not the case with this piece! easily dresses up or down, both jeans and leggings work well",5
"What a beautiful dress! a size 2 fit me perfectly- 5'5 120lbs. i have a small ribcage so it works on me but it might be too tight for someone with a larger one. the fabric is of amazing quality and i was so glad to see there is a liner under the skirt. the top has some delicate beading which looks great but i am concerned it will fall off at some point. i have found that retailer clothing tends to have loose buttons and beading. i have not washed it yet so i am hoping it holds up. otherwise, i am",5
"I feel so lucky to have caught this as a popback--this dress is killer! it's casual style and simple design can be found at other retailers, but the quality and details and fit can only be made by retailer and dolan. it's body skimming but lined so it doesn't cling to flaws, the knit itself is substantial and it's a mockneck, not a turtleneck. i would say this dress runs small because i usually buy medium and this fit in a large. because of weight and lining, this is a spring and early fall dress",5
I fell in love with this dress when i saw it in the catalog and was so bummed to see it on backorder online until may! i went to my local store and they had it in stock so i immediately tried it on. i'm not usually a big fan of maxi dresses but this dress is so pretty and the quality is amazing! the fabric is light and airy but not too delicate and the subtle beading on the top adds an extra special touch. the waist is a little high (it's similar to the picture online) but i'm also 5'10 so it mi,5
"This looks sooooo much better on, than on the hanger/in the picture. i bought the grey, and it is the most comfortable tunic i've ever worn. it is light, airy, and so easy to wear. i wish it came in more prints/colors, cause i'd buy another one, in a skinny minute! if you don't try this on, you're missing out on a surprisingly awesome wardrobe piece. you can wear it year-round with jeans, pants, a vest, wrap, scarves, leggings, boots, sandals or anything else, and it looks chic and whimsical. go",5
"Love this maxi! gorgeous print, flowy and romantic. in my opinion runs a bit tight in the chest- i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8 and it was perfect. i am 5'7"" and it was floor length without tripping me up. looks great on darker skin. i am on the fair side (winter skin!) and the beige color down the middle looked flesh-toned and washed me out a bit, but with a tan this dress will be perfect!",5
"If you love the boho style then this too is for you. it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans, leggings, sandals, boots, and booties.  i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall. it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws. for reference i'm 5'3 and bought the pm but needed the ps. i have recievied tons of compliments and i'm thinking of getting the silver one too!",5
I love this tunic.  it is so comfortable and looks great with leggings and boots.  perfect fall look.,5
"I was looking for a layering piece to go over leggings or skinny jean to cover my backside. i really like this swingy top. i agree that it does run large but i was looking for something flowy so i love it. the cream is a litttle more sheer than i expected so i'm wearing a cami underneath. maybe being taller 5' 8"" helps it not seem so much like a tent. well made and just what i thought it would be from the website model photo. (i used a 20% coupon so help easy the pain of the price of this top -",5
"I visited my local retailer store to purchase a dress and left with two of these tunics.( i love browsing the retailer store, its a feast for my senses)the pavin buttyondown tunics are much more appealing in person.all three feel different due to their color and pattern. to me the burned orange feels like country and fall, the pastel grey one feels spring like and more elegant and the white one feels like summer. they all look very cute on.i did size down and still got the oversize flowing look.this",5
"This shirt is so small. i am not sure who came up with the sizing but you have to go up several sizes to get a comfortable fit. don't waste your time on this shirt. such a shame, it could have been very cute.",1
"I love this poncho! it is flattering (who would have thought i would use that word in the same sentence as a poncho?) and offers enough room for warm clothes underneath.

it is stiffer and thicker than i had originally anticipated, and the material is somewhat itchy so i would recommend long sleeves and clothes with more covering underneath.",5
"Nice, thick material. cream has lining underneath which i appreciated so that it's not sheer in the light.  flattering design",5
I saw this dress and i thought it would be perfect for that night that you don't feel like wearing just jeans yet you don't want to be overdressed. the dress is 100% cotton and is extremely comfortable. i paired with an open toe wide heeled bootie and a long necklace. the dress has a slight a line bottom but fits close to the body in chest and arms. extremely flattering for all body types and the color is a pretty blue. a dress for all seasons!!!!,5
"Yes, it runs a little large - i usually get a s or m in tops, but for this i bought a s. i am 5'2"", 130 lbs, and i did not get the petite- i feel like the regular hits me at the same area as the model in picture. i went into retailer looking for a dress, and walked out with this vest too - had to have. versatile, stylish, pockets, good quality!",5
"Love these pants - they are a perfect color, are of a good weight (i sometimes worry that light-colored pants are going to be see through), and fit wonderfully. they are true to size and are narrow down the leg - perfect for flats, boots, booties, or sandals for summer!",5
"I bought these about a month ago in the sky blue - gorgeous color! i was a little disappointed because they fit bigger than i normally wear my pants, but i decided to keep them anyway. they are the most comfortable pants i've ever worn - butter soft. i have dressed them up with a nice top and suede booties, and also worn casual with a baggy sweater and toms. i highly recommend these pants!",5
"Found this randomly in the store (online return) and didn't expect to like it but tried it on and fell in love with it. extremely comfortable dress, but also has a unique/special design that makes you feel great wearing it. will be perfect to wear out when don't want to look too dressed up or like trying too hard.",5
I fell in love with this poncho at first sight. the colors are neutral so it can be worn with a lot. i'm a typical m and it does run large so i went with a s and it's perfect. long enough to cover leggings and great for the in between seasons. i've worn it at least five times since purchase and get compliments every time.,5
I love ag jeans and these are fabulous! i can't say enough about how well ag jeans fit and hold up over time. i have several pair. i purchased the royal blue color in the store. they held their shape all day and were super comfy. i decided to purchased two more pairs with the online sale because i know i will be wearing these for a long time.,5
"I love how the white and beige were not see through and actually very forgiving to people with cellulite. love love the fit. highly recommend. i'm always a 30 but in these i even fit into the 29. i would say if you're in between, size down. i love the fit so much that i got the beige and white. highly recommend. hit at my ankle for me at 5'6",5
"I'm super happy with this dress! it's extremely well made, very light and comfortable and the shoulder cutouts are tastefully done. this dress is cotton but doesn't look cheap or too casual; it's one of those rare finds that will look great dressed up or down. this will absolutely work across seasons, with leggings and boots/booties or bare legs and sandals when spring comes around. i do feel like it runs a little large, but again it's 100% cotton so i know there will be some shrinking when wash",5
Got this poncho for christmas and loved it the moment i got it out of the box!! great quality and looks great cant go wrong with this purchase.,5
"I absolutely love ag stevie ankle jeans and own them in three different colors. i'm on the shorter side, so in terms of length i'm able to wear them as regular jeans. the fabric is comfy and stretchy and the range of colors is great for wardrobe diversity and mixing and matching! this particular style is my absolute favorite. although ag jeans are on the pricier side, after i bought my first pair i was a convert. as opposed to other brands, i find that they are a worthwhile investment. as other",5
"I am 5'3 and weigh around 150 and the medium fit me perfectly, hit me just below the knee cap. it's cotton/linen but not as prone to wrinkles as i thought it would be. it's double lined, made from a quality fabric. thicker but still very much breathable. will see how this holds up in kansas city's 95 degree summers but so far mid-80's it's been just fine. i'd definitely recommend this skirt. the only thing that this skirt is missing is pockets!",5
"This vest is a great fall item. the asymmetrical design and unusual buttons really give it interest even though it is black. you could wear it open or closed, both look cute. appears to be high quality.",5
"I noticed half of the reviews on here were from women with a slim/straight and/or petite figure. fit-and-flare dresses simply will not work for you; it's the entire purpose behind the ""flare"" shape at the hip. it will be too large for women without wider hips.
-------------------------
that said, i found this perfect for me in every way. after having a baby, it's hard to find a dress that fits my more curvy shape where most of my weight fell on the hips and bust. i wish this dress was a tad long",5
"Cute colored jeans.  ordered the sky color & when it arrived,  the color was a medium moss green color.  the color was beautiful but was expecting a light blue so sadly i returned them.",5
I love these jeans! you can dress them up or down.,5
"Bought them in store and have worn them twice. very flattering! they have maintained their shape through the day. i'm 5/4"" and usually wear a 31"" inseam, and these are perfect ankle length. i'm tempted to buy another color!",5
Love another pair of ag stevie's!,5
"I purchased this dress in white and am quite happy with the fit and design. not too fancy but definitely not casual either. easy to dress up or down and can be worn for various occasions. the fit is great, but i do wish it was not so lose around the belly (it truly is fine though). has more of the hanging feel than the fitted feel. very comfortable for an evening out.",5
"These pants are perfect! they are amazingly comfortable and soft - i could wear them all the time. i'm 5'2"" and have been looking for shorter jeans to wear with ankle booties, which has been pretty tough. i ordered 29 petite and the description said the inseam would be 24"". i don't know if that's true since they fall right at my ankle and usually that's around a 26"" inseam, but definitely a great length and i don't need to hem. the leg opening isn't too big, so i can roll it up/cuff them to get",5
"I purchased these jeans because they were on sale and i figured they'd be a good alt to my other white denim jeans. these have by far exceeded my expectations! my fav jeans, period. i'm 5'2 1/2"" but have a long torso and though west size 25, am athletic and curvy, so petite jeans don't really work for me. these are just the best cut and fit!",5
"Love love love. i tried it on a whim when returning a shipped item. it's gorgeous and incredibly flattering. runs large (it's drapey and would likely look good in your normal size since you can synch the waist, but probably best to size down as it seemed large in the bust size - which isn't an issue i usually run into). 

it's quickly become a great staple for work. definitely pair it with bodycon pants/ leggings/ skinny jeans - and it looks unique and very professional.",5
This is the most beautiful dress. i am so happy that i got it. it is very comfortable and the colors are brilliant. it's completely appropriate for a holiday party which is what i got it for and i'll be wearing it to a wedding in may also.,5
"I wasn't all that impressed with this dress on the hanger, but i am so glad i tried it on. it is super comfortable, very flattering, and can be worn multiple ways. spot on!",5
"These jeans look great with everything and fit great. i can dress them up with wedges or throw them on with flip flops and they are so comfortable, too. i've had many compliments already.",5
"This dress looks great on...feminine and swishy! color is bright and the underslip is nicely attached, which i appreciate...no fighting with straps, etc. i ordered a six for my 5'4"", 130 lb, 34dd self and it fits like a dream. the extra 5 lbs i support with lots of food is on my tummy, just to give you an idea of my shape.",5
"I love, love, love this dress! it fits perfectly! it is comfortable and can be dressed up or down. i get compliments on it every time i wear it!",5
"Not what i was expecting, but pleasantly surprised.  was envisioning a more structured/tailored trouser, but these are closer to leggings, albeit very substantial ones with ""real pant"" touches like a zip/button front and (faux) pockets.  they're form fitting, soft yet supportive, stretchy, incredibly comfortable, and tts.  i'm a pretty legit 10 in pants (30/31), and the 10's near perfect, with the rise coming right to my belly button.  think i'll grab another pair now while they're available.",5
"I'm bought this dress at 16 weeks pregnant and am loving it! the top drapes, but is still form-fitting enough to show off a little bump. i've received so many compliments. the skirt is short, but i love it, makes legs look great with tights! i sized up a little to allow for room to grow.",5
"I ordered this dress to wear to a summer wedding in san francisco. i liked that it had sleeves, a plus. when i was trying it on, i found that it was a little snug, then realized it was the slip, which is not too tight at all once the dress is on. it helps to smooth those little bumps. it is drop waist style, which skims the torso, then flares out prettily. all in all very complimentary, beautiful color, well made. very pleased; it will be comfortable and perfect at the wedding.",5
"I'm 5'5 and curvy body shape, bought size 6 because i want it to be a bit loose, turns out i could go with size 4 too, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. this come with a crop tank top to go inside the lace blouse.",5
"I decided to splurge. i would not normally spend $200 for a pair of jeans, but when they went on sale, i decided to go for it. i am so glad that i did. mother has a customer for life. these jeans are the best by far. i normally wear a size 4 (27) in most jeans, but wear a 28 in j brand and some others. so i was a little nervous by previous reviewers not just on this website. i decided to go with the 28 since in mother brand this is actually a 4/6. they fit great!",5
"Love this layered turtleneck dress. super cute and super comfy. love the contrastin pattern and fabric of the top half and the skirt. also the skirt is very hip hugging as shown in the photo, with the result being flattering. i wore it to work with sweater tights and boots (winter in seattle) and felt completely put together.",5
"I had loved this on-line when i saw the pretty floral pattern. however, in person, it is such a disappointment. the quality of the fabric and the fit are just very poor.",1
"This is an amazing top. fits perfectly, beautiful detail, and amazing fabric. i actually came back to the site just so i could order it in all available colors, but unfortunately it's only in navy. don't hesitate to buy this!",5
"Like everyone else, i ignored this vest in the store. my mom actually gave it to me to try on and practically forced me to buy it. it wasn't until  i got home that i discovered its versatility. i got it in the beginning of june so haven't been able to wear it much, but fall is quickly approaching and i already have at least ten outfits to wear with it. it's classy and can dress up any outfit.",5
"Beautiful color and flattering fit on me. i bought the size 4 and it fits my 5'5"" 125 lb frame perfectly. i love that it has sleeves!! no worries about upper arms. it is light and silky even though it is not made of silk. it is elegant and casual at the same time thus versatile. i will wear it to three different weddings this summer and can make it work for the office too. love it. worth every penny..",5
"Unlike some of the other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size. post pregnancy i am a 6 on top and an 8 on the bottom. ordered a 6 and it is perfect. (140 lbs and 34c) perhaps that's because i'm long waisted and the waistline hits right below my rib cage?

the colors, materials and quality are wonderful. i can see wearing this in the winter and summer. in fact, it will look lovely against sun kissed skin.

one thing, the top portion appeared to be a knit in the pictures online, howeve",5
"These are great. they fit tts - i'm a 26 in most denim brands & that's the size i got. the material has some give but doesn't stretch out. the color is not super white so you can actually wear them in the colder weather season as well. at 5'4"", they were a little longer on me than shown on the model. i find them very comfortable.",5
I love this dress. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i was able to wear it to work and look nice but stylish. it was nice that it isn't too heavy but the turtleneck kept me warm enough.,5
"I'm a curvy size 8, and these pants fit 
beautifully. 
they're a fairly narrow (cropped) leg, with a slight flare. i'm happy and ordering another pair.",5
"I ordered this on the black friday sale. one reviewer mentions that the fabric is thin, and i ordered it anyway because the design was unique. besides, i have another bailey 44 dress and felt that i knew what to expect on quality. when it arrived, i was pleasantly surprised. while not thick, the fabric is a better quality than my other dress. plus, the style is unique and flattering. i am 5'4"", and it hits 2-3 inches above my knee. i will definitely wear it to work with knee boots!",5
"I should have listened to the reviews that said this top was too boxy, but i didn't believe them and bought it anyway. i was wrong! this top is so boxy and wide, just awful.",1
"I love this dress. it is very cute and comfortable and great for football games / everyday wear. it is a little long, which is great for me since i'm taller.",5
"I've been looking for an off the shoulder trend item and this one fits the bill perfectly. the denim is a nice color and weight, love, love the pockets! the neckline is not too frilly, the sleeves are fluttery but not over the top ruffled. i wore this dress to lunch with cute flat sandals and i must say it looked adorable! sad i didn't find this earlier in the summer, but will wear when i can. my only concern is that it will shrink in length, i'm hoping not. this one will def be taken to the dry",5
"I'm normally a small in retailer tops. i ordered a small, and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper (more fitted) part. it all went horribly wrong from there. the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent, instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame. this was such a disappointment, as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality.",1
I was pleasantly surprised with this cardigan! i get so many compliments- i can easily see me carrying this into my fall wardrobe!,5
"It is a little pricey for what it is, but i love it so much that i am keeping it. i am normally size 4-6 and the s fits great. the rope straps are just adorable!",5
"This is a really well made, great looking blouse. the details are charming. i like that it is a good weight, not too sheer. the 3/4 sleeves are perfect. i ordered a medium and it is a good fit overall. so glad i put it in my shopping cart to try. it's a keeper!",5
I really like the style and cute stripes and i love the versatility of the design of this shirt. fits true to size and hides my stomach just in the right places,5
This ruffle tee is adorable on. the fabric is light but not thin and the styling is very flattering to any figure. i look forward to wearing it as a transition piece as it stays warm long into fall in the south.,5
"I think when this is new, it runs big, and then shrinks to the right size. that's what it did for me anyway. it did shrink after one wash, but not significantly. i bought it in m and feel it stayed within that range. super cute with shorts - airy, light. love the white. ordering another color!",5
"Cute swing tee! fit for me is perfect. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs and i bought my usual small. length is nice. fits me just at my hips. i can wear to work and on the weekends. a little concerned  the fabric may pill so i'm taking extra care. receive compliments every time i wear either color. love.",5
"This top is so comfortable and better quality than i expected. ruffles fall nicely over your sholulder and there is a fabric underarm, i don't have to wear a tank top underneath like i normally would with tops with wide opening around arms. color is beautiful too, i really love it. true to size.",5
"I thought this top would make me look extremely boxy, but i couldn't resist the stripes and the cut of the top. i did size down, and so glad i did! adorable .... fun and flattering! and that's coming from a curvy girl, with a ddd bust. soo soft!!!!",5
"I got this in black and it's a great basic t-shirt- the v-neck is just right in depth, and the material is very soft and lightweight. the fit is good. the back is long, which can be good or not-so-good depending on how you want to wear it. i really like the la t shirts because the material has a nice soft drape and they seem to fit exceptionally well.",5
I love the loose vibe of this top. the bold stripes are super cute. i can dress this up or wear with jeans and sneakers. get this top ladies!,5
"This top takes every other tee and blows it out of the water! it appears subtle on the hanger, but it looks so lady like on! the flutter sleeve are darling. the top does have a lot of volume, but the drape is so lovely, it adds some shape. it is perfect to wear everyday and dress up! i bought to wear with the bryden skirt. for reference, i purchased ordered the xs (though i am wearing a s in the photo) and i am 34c, 26"" waist. the shoulder fit okay with easter size, but there was a little less v",5
"I just bought this top in size medium and i love it. super comfortable and flowy. if you want to dry it in the machine, just put cold air and it won't shrink. don't use hot air...",5
"You know how you hope that a dress that you order online is as good as you think it will be? well, this one is better then i had hoped! it fits beautifully. it is crafted beautifully. there is nothing i don't like about it. i was pleasantly surprised at how light the fabric is. i thought it might be a heavier denim, but it is perfect. not so light that you can see through it, but cool and breezy even in the florida heat. do yourself a favor and grab this one before it's gone!",5
Love this dress! it is very comfortable and stylish. looks great with flats or wedges. material is soft and comfy! definitely worth the price.,5
Adorable denim dress! fabric is lighter than i imagined but is very flattering. perfect length. this is not a form fitting dress at all so if you're going for that pass on the dress or possibly order a size down.,5
"This.
an unexpected purchase...i found this on my way to the dressing room.
the fit is stunning. i sized way down (i.e. normally wear 10/12, curvy, and bought a small).
it accentuates my curves, and is incredibly flattering. i bought the navy, and will be adding another color soon!
the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy. it's a nice addition to my work wardrobe.",5
I love these! they are so soft! the high waist is awesome and fits like a glove. they don't stretch out. i wear with a heel and get tons of compliments. they make my hips look smaller than they are.,5
"The photos online make it look like a comfortable, relaxed, lightweight early fall/spring cardigan. when it arrived it looked very wrinkly and there is no ""shimmer"" as far as i can tell. i tried using my steamer to get some of the wrinkles out, but it didn't work. it looks too rumpled and i don't want to wear something that looks like i just rolled out of bed.",1
"This is one of my absolute favorite dresses of the season! fun, flirty and fashionable! i wore it with a chunky necklace, floppy hat and sandals one time and with wedges and dangly earrings the other time. it is a must own dress!",5
"I was a little nervous to buy these because they are such a statement piece. but i love them! they are so comfortable which is rare for jeans. they create the optical illusion that i am a super model, so i will wear them as often as possible. very flattering and comfy=win win!",5
"Paige jeans are obviously known for their luxurious feel and amazing fit. these jeans are the best new addition to your collection. the perfect high rise and not as extreme flair, these might beat out your skinny jeans for your nights out. they do come extremely long, so they will most likely need to be hemmed. i get huge compliements when i wear them and told how they compliement my legs in the best way. if you're debating on whether to jump onto the flair trend, i'd go with these!",5
"Great fit i'm petite and bought size 29. my hips and waist differ by 10"", so i'm very curvy. i love the fit and look just by rolling them up. my 1st pair of ag jeans and i will definitely buy more.",5
"I have been searching for months to find a pair of top-quality, slim fit, high-waisted jeans, either straight leg or flare. my search has ended with these flare jeans from paige, thanks to retailer. the fabric is incredibly soft, yet has that little ""snap"" of stretchiness we have all come to expect in expensive jeans. i also like the dark wash and the fact that there aren't those odd color striations across the hips. i bought size 27, which fits me perfectly. (virtually all my other jeans a",5
"Lovely blouse-- very well made. i had a baby last year and recently weaned so my bust line is changing-- right now somewhere between a 36d and c. the medium was a little roomy for, i could've easily sized down but i like the airy look so i think i will keep it this size. quality fabric, very comfortable yet dressy. i'd definitely recommend this blouse.",5
Super soft and flattering fit. i'm 5 feet 4 inches and petite was the perfect length.,5
Purchased this top in the store on sale. love the material. very soft and comfortable. love the black and white combination. i am petite so the top is a great length on me. i can see that if you are tall it might be to short.,5
"I received this tank today and i fell in love with it immediately! i am petite (5'3""/36b/108 lbs) and purchased this in the only size left, which was a small. yes....it is very billowy (but i do a half tuck into my pants and that solves the problem perfectly and looks great!!) i have very well toned arms and the way this is cut just accentuatea this! yay!! the fabric is soft and the overall look is super feminine!!! so very happy with my purchase! plan on wearing with jeans shorts/cropped jeans/",5
"Fits like a dream. i have a thick middle and tend to have problems with anything that flairs out, so i was so happy that it hung beautifully on me. even though i wasn't really looking for a sweater to take on a trip to europe in a few weeks, i bought it on the spot. i bought it in neutral which is the only color the store had and after seeing the darker color am happy with it. i love the belt since most sweaters don't have anything to close them and the belt lays perfectly as well.",5
"I am always on the hunt for jeans and regularly buy paige - these jeans are different than the regular paige styles, in all the best ways. they are made with super soft denim that is comfortable and very flattering; the waist is high, so my tush doesn't hang out when i sit - i love them. i am 5'8"" and 140lbs and these are long. i can only wear them with heels, but i was looking for a dress up jean and these are it!",5
"Love this dress! really nice quality, timeless design, not to mention the flared sleeves are so flattering! this dress makes me feel so cute and tiny. i normally struggle to function in off the shoulder tops but deal with it because i love the way that they look, but this one really is the perfect fit and has just the right amount of give without being too loose. the body size and length does run large, so size down on this one. now i understand why the petites were all sold out? whatever, modes",5
"I got this shirt because of the flutter sleeves, and i'm not disappointed. it is a classic t, with that little bit of an edge due to the sleeves. it is not fitted, which is what i was looking for. it also covers my bum, which i don't always like hanging out there. in all, it's perfect for my needs. i got the turquoise one and i may get the white one too!",5
"Dress is so comfortable. great for town or resort. 5'7"" size 6 34a and i got a size small.",5
"Easy to wear with black or grey. i will wear as a work jacket, not necessarily just an outwear piece",5
Exactly as pictured. great and lightweight for summer but long enough with the cowl neck to layer for colder seasons. so comfy and easy.,5
Love love love this sweater! lots of compliments as well :)),5
This sweater is the perfect sweater except for one thing.....it sheds everywhere. i can simply pick up the sweater and shake it in one hand and 40 large pieces of lint go everywhere on the ground and on you. if you like dark jeans- don't purchase. before i walked out of the store- the salesperson had to use a delineator on me- it was hysterical. sheds so much,1
"I tried this on in the store in a medium by accident, thinking that it was a large. i loved it even though the front was way too short on me and the elastic waist was way too tight. the store didn't have the next size up and after reading the other reviews i decided to order my standard xl online. its a keeper! i am plus sized and have an ample mid section and this was still flattering on me. i plan to wear it with a black duster sweater, leggings, and boots all winter long and then when the wea",5
I just got this sweater and it really is a great fall weight. i disagree with other reviewers that it is oversized and that the sleeves are long. i found the sleeves to be just right and it to fit normally. i almost wish i got a medium just so it would be a little baggier and the sleeves would be a little longer. i got the green and am really happy with the color.,5
Pretty blush color that is still neutral enough to wear with just about any outfit. runs true to size imo. can't wait to wear it this fall/winter.,5
"I see that many of you, like myself, fell in love with the look and feel of this sweater, and reluctantly bought it even though it sheds like crazy! i just wanted to let you all in on a little trick to stop the shedding (it will sound strange, but it worked like a charm!) fold up the sweater, seal it in a ziploc bag, and pop it in the freezer for 24 hours. bam! it will shed no more! now i can completely love this sweater. :)",5
"I found this at my local store on sale and immediately snatched it up. i did not think of the wrap flying open until i got home and tried it on again. luckily, i was able to sew it up enough without compromising the drape and movement of the dress and without causing anyou pulling or puckering which isn't always easy when working with jersey.

that said, i really like the dress otherwise. it's super soft and i think i'll get a lot of wear out of it when i want something cute and comfy to put on.",5
I bought this dress for a cruise i'm going on in january. it's so light and comfortable. i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. it will look really cute with a jean jacket and some booties. great price for this dress! you can't pass this up!!,5
"I love this incredibly soft fabric , it's well designed and very flattering . i am 6' tall with a large bustline , dresses can be difficult as the waistline usually hits in the wrong spot . but not this dress ! it's hits the spot and the high-lo hemline flatters my legs ! bought this to wear to hawaii ,paired with a panama hat and a pair of flatform sandels .",5
Great structure,5
"Soft, versatile comfort. what more could you want in a legging?",5
"I bought this for an upcoming late-september seaside trip because it looked like it would be warm enough for cooler nights, but not too warm because of the open weave. i just received it yesterday, and i adore it. i got the pink color and was really torn between the green and the pink. i was hoping the pink would look more beige from far away (per one of the other reviews) and i was happy that it does. up close you can really see the pink, but from an arm's length away or more, it looks beige wi",5
Well fitted kinda slouchy sweater. matches photo and product description. looking forward to cooler temps!,5
Purchased this item on sale-received it and it had two huge holes on the side.not possible to repair. very disappointed in lack of quality control. :(,1
I am in love with this sweater. i am 5'4 and wear a size 8 and bought a large. perfect length and fit. will wear with jeans or leggings. the quality was amazing and i can't wait to wear it!,5
I can't wait for it to get colder so i can wear this out. love the ochre color paired with the maroon faux fur lapel. i especially love the detail at the pocket edges. very well made. the faux fur is luxuriously soft and removable. this will go great with denim and long skirts. the wool is a bit stiff in my opinion but that's okay. this will make a great addition to your autumn and winter closet. most of my outerwear are blacks or dark blues or dark greys so it's nice to be able to wear a bit of,5
This shirt makes me feel stylish without trying! i can put this on and feel like a fashion blogger without trying! it is comfortable and fits true to size. it is flattering at the bottom without too much width/peplum.,5
"This is just the perfect sweater in my opinion. i got it in the rose, which is a gorgeous subtle color that will go with just about anything. i love the knit pattern and the buttons, and the sleeves are nice and long, which is crucial for me at my height (5'11""). overall i just see myself throwing this on over everything, so i'm sure i will treasure this for years to come!",5
Just lovely!  gift for my daughter who has two other vegan leather jackets from retailer!,5
"Absolutely love this top. it can be worn with jeans or a nice pair of pants. material is so soft.. love the length , little longer in the back. definitely would buy in another color",5
"I love this sweater! it's vivid, soft and high quality. it's a little shorter than i'd normally go for, but it will look great with a mid to high rise jean. it runs true to size and meant to be roomy. the red is very vibrant.",5
"This is an adorable top. sweet back detail, thin material but soft. the top is two sizes too big, i'm normally a large and a small fits. i know it is supposed to be baggy but the large was inches too big under each arm. size down and petite ladies will be sized out. love this though.",5
This top is just lovely. the bow on the back is so unusual. i am so glad i bought it!!! i washed it on gentle and it turned out great!!!,5
"This skirt is super cute and versatile. dressed up but still pretty casual with a sweater, tights, and boots. i'd say true to size or maybe runs a little on the large side; definitely doesn't run small. love it!",5
"I like this so much that i ordered it in both colors. it is soft can be worn both ways, and i like the crisscross detail. very comfortable, not formfitting.   i usually order a medium or a large and in this one sized down to a small.",5
This has instantaneously become my favorite sweater in my closet. the fit is great- a little oversized which makes it very cozy. i purchased my usual size xs. the shade of red is perfection. i wished it was a tad bit softer but would buy again and again!,5
"The only problem with this top is that it only comes in two colors.  this is a lightweight easy to wear top that surprises you with the cute design details.  it will be easy to wear in the heat of my hometown.  i don't think it is too thin and i won't need to add a camisole.  i am 5'2"" and weigh 120 and i got a small.  perfect.",5
I love this tee s much i bought 3 different colors! the back is beautiful. it is so comfy and soft but its added spice makes it perfect for those times you want a little more style.,5
"Love this jacket! really wish it came in real leather as well but can't beat this price point. great cut, fit. and love that the zipper is black. looks like it is worn in leather, most peoppe can't tell that it's vegan!",5
I absolutely adore this top!!! i got it in the blue and went back a few days later and got the gray as well. it's super soft and casual but still really cute. it's a little long (i'm 5'4) but i tuck in the front or tie a knot on the side and it looks good. i wish they had more colors so i could have a few more of these!,5
Very flattering cut.  very loose & flowy.  runs a little big for a small but fits well for someone who sometimes fits medium depending on the cut.  i need to wear a bralette with this top.,5
I have these tops in white and blue. very comfotable to wear. the back part swings with movements and is flattering. good price so i got one for my daughter!,5
"Lovely, warm sweater. excellent quality, fits as shown on model",5
"I saw this in the kelly green color one size larger than my normal. it didn't look much but i was so drawn to the very pretty green color so i tried it on anyway. boy, am i really glad i did! this is more than just your basic everyday tee. the back has a very cute gingham pleating detail that hangs well when paired with a skinny jean or leggings. material was pretty substantial for a tee and definitely not see-through. i am a true m on most retailer tops and this one is pretty true to size. the on",5
"I love this jacket. it is a perfect moto style jacket without being overly aggressive looking because it doesn't have the silver hardware. instead all the hardware is black which gives it a cleaner minimalist look. it is not super heavy. it also has a cute blue and white striped lining, which if you turn up the sleeves adds a surprise. i bought it in a size small so that it was comfortable and i would be able to put a light sweater under it if i wanted to. i generally take an xs or sometimes a s",5
"This top is simple but super cute and comfortable. the bow in the back adds a feminine touch and it fits well (no gaping arm holes and not too tight or too loose). the white color is slightly see-through but not enough to wear a cami with my neutral racer-back bra. the xs fit me perfectly. for reference, i'm 5'6"", small busted and 125 lbs.",5
"Very cute top. i ordered the white & it is thin so you might want to wear a cami with it. will look very cute with jeans, shorts or skirts. love the back! wish it came in more colors - would definitely order it in black.",5
This top is perfect! i love the fit and the length and the weight of the fabric! it is thin without being sheer. i just wish there were other fun colors...,5
"I usually pick the large size when it comes to fitted jackets but in this case i decided to go with size medium.  i have a broad back and round shoulders and large upper arms.  when i put the size large on, the body of the jacket looked too boxy on me.  the medium is much more flattering but i cannot put a thick layer on underneath.  when the weather gets cooler, i am pairing this with my herbalist dress and my other sleeveless garments.  i am 135# 36d 38/28/35.",5
This is a great casual shirt that works great for a day at the beach and is also comfortable enough to wear to sleep. wore this shirt to school one day with an undershirt underneath and wore it again hiking several days later with just a sports bra underneath.,5
"I love swing dresses but they never seem to work out for me. however, lately i have been trying on swing tops like this one and they are super scores! i love this top! in my store, they had a rack of test materials where they don't have the full line but they have a look at some online features or clothes that are very new releases. this was on the rack. i knew it wasn't my size but i tried it on anyway and i am absolutely in love. i am waiting for a sale (as always) but i am going to get this i",5
"Very feminine, fun and if you like this style i highly recommend. i am a 6/8 and both fit the same so i went with the 6- 36c bust 29 waist-short torso. fabric nice and light and i need no cami! very attractive blouse and very retailer.",5
"I am not usually one for super girly tops, but i could not resist this top. the material is beautiful and this top can definitely be dressed up or dressed down, i think it is extremely versatile. it is a little bit see-through but if you just wear a nude bra it's perfect! i usually wear a 00 or 0 but i got a 2 in this top because it is a little tight in the sleeves/across the shoulders. but if you size up you should be perfect! super cute and i definitely recommend you get before it sells out!",5
"I love this shirt! it's such a beautiful striking color, yet still simple enough to not take the spotlight. the peekaboo shoulders are totally cute. i bought another one of these when it went on sale. so now i have two just in case;) haha",5
Love this top b/c it's very feminine! got this at 20% off and it's very flattering!,5
"The design and quality are fantastic!
i had to order a little larger because of my bust and shoulders - it's still flattering though. can be dressed up or casual. i wish it came in more colors!",5
"I was a bit apprehensive about buying the top, after reading the reviews.  surprisingly, i love the shirt!  it's very feminine; soft; light for the hot months; and, figure flattering.",5
"Just got this top and i love it! it's color is more saturated in person, which i like. more of a pinky-purple. very sweet and feminine. i still have a bit of a ""mommy tummy"" and the style hides that pretty well. it's very soft and comfortable as well. overall, happy with this top :)",5
"So i recommend wearing with something more fitted, or with a flare (jeans), or tucked in like the picture. i love the detail of hte polka dot on the sleeves and collar (inside), so if you leave the collar open or roll the sleeves up a bit, you see hte contrast.
it is a bit short, and i am petite, i ended up with regular size anyway otherwise, it may have been too short.

colors are nice, and i love the material, it is very soft and hoepfulyl warm (my orffice is freezing). should ahve grabbed it",5
"I am not sure why the first reviewed hated this dress so much. i personally like that it looks a tad retro. length is shorter, but not mini or too short. i ordered the xxs p and it looked ok on me (and i am older). the colors are fun and appropriate for fall, or winter, the sparkle (golden thread) can bring this dress into the holiday season (and beyond). i love the turtleneck part, only thing is it is really high, and the embroidery gets a little lost in it (top of the design) feel is thick, no",5
"Love the pattern, i thought i would be hosed and need a petite, but the regular xs fits nicely. it is on the thiner side, so great for summer (office is cooold)
love subtle squares, glad they still had my size at sale! :-)",5
Great very flattering bohemian dress! and it's silk!,5
"I ordered this top based on the photos. this looked unique and beautiful, plus i've loved past designs by this brand. i thought this would be nice for summer. there isn't a straight-on view of the front of the top for a reason. the model is turned to the side and there is one black flower that stands out below her chest, away from the border of the rest of the flowers. the flower looks kind of like a bee. i believe she is either wearing a size larger or pulling down the top to mask the problem.",1
"I have the pineapple dress from last year. when i saw this top with the lemons, i was in love. i don't usually pay this much for a top, but i had a special event coming up. i searched and searched, but nothing compared to the lemon top, so, with my birthday discount, i bit the bullet and ordered it. my first thought was that it didn't seem very substantial for the price. i decided to keep it though, because it is such a unique piece. i wore a beige cami underneath along with a beige skirt and it",5
"This is a very stylish cardigan but it runs small. i usually take a small but i took a medium in this. for reference i am 130 lbs, chest 36c. i fell so in love with it once i put it on but you have to watch for snags as it is extremely delicate. got the 20% off today and couldn't be happier with this purchase.",5
"I saw someone else wearing this sweater and had to find it! i'm 5'5""and 118 lbs and ordered the small. the back of the sweater hits a few inches above my back pockets. i've been wearing it with a tank underneath and it's been the perfect sweater for fall weather. i was worried the poncho effect might make it hard to wear this sweater with a jacket but it's actually less bulky than other ""real"" sweaters i have.",5
Beautiful sweater - cool enough to wear on a florida evening and it will be perfect for vacation. the sleeves hit right above the wrist bone (exactly as shown on the model) and i really like that. sheer fabric but still a sweater - you will need a cami or tank underneath. can't wait to wear it!,5
"I have always bought interesting, pretty, wearable dresses for my daughters at retailer. now the dresses are just retro funky. sad to see.",1
"The pictures do not do this blouse justice. the pleat in the front is so flattering that i did a double take (this detail doesn't come through the images, which is a shame as it is the most beautiful element of this blouse). the collar that stands up just enough is something unexpected, and the sleeve length is fun yet sophisticated. i am madly in love with this blouse and highly recommend it to anyone. 

it is extremely see-through...so unless you want to show off your nips, you should expect",5
"This is really a lovely top, but the color online is not quite what the color actually is in person. this was a find in my store today and it is a little more lilac than the picture shows. the cut is extremely flattering and the fabric is very soft as is the case with most one september items. the one recommendation that i have for this is that because the main fabric is a soft knit, the proper undergarments are really needed. i tried it with a lace bra and you could see a lot the details of the",5
"Beautiful pink top.  comfortable, love the color and print , style and sleeves.  good quality.  didn't have the issues with the placement of the bees over my breasts that other reviewers did. the bees were at the sides of my breasts. covered my butt for the most part in jeans. flattering cut.  i got an xs (5'2"", 34b, 115#).",5
"I read the previous reviews, but decided to try it out since retailer was having 40% off sale items.
it looks very flattering on me, and great fit for my body type.
i would recommend.",5
"Beautiful material, great design. get a bigger size.",5
"I love this top! was not immediately in love with it when i saw it on line but when i saw it in store the other day and got to try it on i fell in love!! the colors at a little deeper in person, which i loved! it is a traditional soft flannel top! it is fitted and flattering! a must have for fall/winter!!",5
"The photos don't look it, but the one i received was a cropped length. the bottom of the sweater's longest parts didn't even reach the top of my mid-rise pants. and i'm 5'3"" so it wasn't that the model is a lot shorter than me unless their models are 4' tall. 

disappointed since i wasted my retailer discount on this!",1
"This shirt runs true to size. i'm an xl and it fit perfectly! that is my first reason for loving it. it is super soft and so comfortable i don't want to take it off! the trim inside the cuffs and button line is navy with large white polka dots, which i love. the ruffle of the shoulders i'm not super wild on but it does give it a touch of different. the color of the photo is very accurate. i love the muted pink in the plaid.",5
I love this more than my pineapple top. i am 128lbs and wear between a size 2-4 in tops got this in size 4 (same as the pineapple) and fits perfectly and comfotably. the color is white and has a lovely lace pattern. i would say it runs a litle on the small side. material is a bit more stiff than my pineapple top but i love the way it feels. in my opinion this is a staple top you can dress it up for a wedding or just going out its super lovely. they were so popular at the retailer near me tw,5
"Purchased as a gift, but needed to return due to recipient weight challenged in past 6 months. heavier material of neutral tone ( with detailing of epaulets) pairs well with dresses, skirts, jeans, jeggings and whatever style of boots. veratile garment and will re-purchase for self in future.",5
"This top hangs very nicely on me. i got the blue and have received compliments every single time i have worn it. it may help that i'm tallish with long legs. i usually wear it with black leggings and ankle boots. love, love, love it!",5
"Soft and unique. love the sleeves. my usual size medium fits perfectly. per the other reviewer, i guess my bust is large enough for the flowers to be on the side and not directly on breasts! my only wish is that it has some embroidery on it....love!!",5
This top has a bit of a retro flare but so adorable on. looks really cute with a pair of faded boot cut jeans.,5
"Love this dress. from the great fabric (soft yet substantial) that's similar to sweater material, to the amazing detail of the flower design (it's really so unique and i mean that in a good way!), to the color (a tan with gold flecking), and lastly to the really flattering fit, not to mention those retro bell sleeves!  all around a fun dress! it was true to size and not too short, hitting my 5'4"" height about 2"" above my knees.",5
I thought this blouse ran a bit large-swinging wide at the hips. it does bunch in the bust area if you are larger. a correct undergarment fixed this problem. i am a 36ddd and thought the size 4 was perfect.,5
"This jacket was a little shorter than i had expected, but i still really enjoy the cut and fit of it.",5
"Despite being batwing and sort of poncho-like, this sweater is quite flattering on. hangs just right. unique cut and soft fabric.",5
"I bought this dress during the retailer weekend and i'm so happy i did!  this is a very well-made, well-designed dress that is quite figure flattering.  the marriage of artsy and colorful on a neutral background makes sense and the combination of colors and the style of the dress work well together.  the wearer will definitely have several options for footwear pairings.  this dress is as fun and playful as it is classy.  i can't wait for an occasion to wear this dress!",5
Ordered this in my normal size large in taupe. the jacket fit tts. the length was cropped but just long enough (hit just below my belly button) to feel comfortable and not too short for my 5'9 height. the quality feels good.,5
Got this in the blue/floral and absolutely love it!!,5
"Ugh, i was so disappointed with this shirt. i was so excited when i saw it online and thought it would be a perfect summer shirt with the light colors and the flower print. unfortunately it falls flat and i understand now why they don't have a straight on photo of the shirt, its very plain and lays very unflatteringly. it's definitely missing something in the front. i typically wear a small to an extra small and i ordered this in an extra small and would have needed an xxs if i hadn't returned i",1
"I've wondered abt this swtr but hesitated to order being it has dolman sleeves. decided to wait for it to come in at the local store. yesterday i spotted it in the store & tried on the orange, labeled 'red' online. i was really looking for the 'cream' but the store did not have it. well, the orange is really much prettier in person. fit is perfect in my usual size s. overall body fit & length is generous, sleeves are wrist length & i'm only 5'3"". most likely the sleeves will be shorter on taller",5
"Lol on the previous comment about it being a poor man?s pineapple blouse. i think the pineapple blouse prints are too large on a petite person like me (i?m 5?2?), thus i prefer this blouse. i concur with the previous reviewer about getting makeup on the blouse due to the narrow collar. if you wear makeup like i do, you must find a trick to taking it on and off. for me, i put it on prior to putting on makeup (i even put tissue paper around the collar while putting on makeup, and don?t even think",5
"I was on the fence about this top, because i don't typically do longer tunic styles. however, it really is quite lovely. i paired it with long jeans, wedge sandals, and a delicate necklace - so pretty! it fits very nicely and i was surprised at how much i liked the length.",5
The print doesn't necessarily works for everybody.,1
"I purchased this is off white and it is a stunner! feminine? check! stylish? check! hem hits at a flattering part of the body? check! great with jeans or tailored pants? check! i cannot say anything bad about this blouse-well, maybe the button back is a little convenient but it sure looks pretty! i am 5' 21/2"" and 110 pounds and usually wear a 0 or 2 but i purchased in a size 4 and it fits perfectly! can't wait to wear this with my olive green skinny jeans!",5
Love!! so comfy! i wish they came in more colors. i'd order every one!!,5
"I ordered these jsut coz they were on sale... i now wish my size was offered in more colors. (only mossy-sage was left, though nice neutral color, really0.

the fit is great, stretchy but stil lslightly structured. i ordered the 25p and that was perfect, length fine too (i am 5'1.5"", 115 lbs).

looked really nice with a pair of red heel i was trying on too!",5
"I wear jeans so much, therefore i love to a variety in color. these jeans are so comfortable. they are like wearing sweat pants, but they truly keep their shape so well. i bought the red, which is a year around red, kind of a bright apple red. i will definitely be buying another pair of these ag jeans.",5
"I really like this top.  for reference, i am usually an xs or s in retailer tops since many of them run large, however, in this top i ordered a size m and it fit nicely.  in any brand other than retailer, my usual size is m as i am 36d bust, 132 lbs., 5""5.",5
I love this dress! i have an hour glass figure and the dress is very flattering on me. i didn't encounter a problem with the colors or pattern as others have stated.,5
"Love this jacket!!! it is soooo soft and goes with everything. you will want to wear it every day. loved it so much i bought my mother one, too.",5
"I bought these in 'vintage sage' and i grab for them as often as my favorite skinny jeans. if you are just dipping your toe in colored pants i would reccomend the same color, it is undertsated and easily paired with so many other colors. the legs run a little big but the waist is tru to size, so for comfort i went with my usual size.",5
"Love these jeans. fit great. i've had other colored denim from ag that stretched out too much, were too thin, but these are a nice thicker fabric. i ordered the red and the moss, and the red fit a little better than the moss in the same size. not sure if the dye process affects the fabric but the red pair seemed a bit more substantial. the moss is great too though, so i may keep both.",5
I wish i could buy this is more colors! so easy to dress up or dress down,5
Love this dress!!! must try on to see how cute is really is.,5
"Finally a top that fits true to size, is comfortable, and is the quality i expect when shopping at retailer. i cannot recommend this top more! if it came in other color motifs i would buy them too. perfect fall transition top.",5
"Gosh, this is a beauty! maeve can be a little iffy on sizing, but i find this to fit tts. beautiful details, fit is comfortable yet elegant, nice length...i have zero complaints on this. it is sheer enough to need something underneath, but the fabric is lightweight enough that the extra layer doesn't seem bothersome. nice quality piece (not overly delicate despite the lacy details and sheerish fabric).",5
"Love this blouse--looks like a fp blouse yet a bit cheaper and well made! looks feminine and edgy on. may size out for taller gals b/c it is a bit on the shorter length. i am 5'5"" and the length is just right on me untucked. the lace on the sleeves are gorgeous and neckline is not too high!",5
"I usually wear either an xs or a small and i went with the small because i wanted it flowy and long because i am 5'9. it is a great fit, but it is a little sheer. i will probably have to wear a cami underneath.",5
I got this shirt 2 weeks ago and have already worn it 4 times! i love it and every time i wear it i get compliments on it. it is so flattering with jeans or nice fitted black pants. if you are wavering about getting this shirt.... get it. i promise you will love it.,5
Not sure where to start with this top...it's that good! i am usually a large in most maeve tops and that's sizing up for extra flow. i ended up grabbing this piece of perfection in an xl only because it ran a little shorter than i anticipated and was kind of tight through my shoulders. i wanted more flow (as always) so i went up in size. for that reason i feel it runs pretty true to size. this is the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and is definitely a must have! it has sold out with,5
"Frustrated that retailer tops have been so short lately! i'm 5'7"" and it hits at the top of my pants. makes me look a bit boxy. so disappointing because i wanted it for family photos. otherwise the design is gorgeous. having a hard time returning it but for the price point, it probably has to go back :(",5
Looks great! it is more off white/tan then white though,5
"This is sure to become my favorite shirt! this shirt is feminine and the fit is perfect. the white lace is strategically placed, so you do not have to wear a cami on those hot summer days, but you can for the work day. i cannot wait to wear this!!",5
"This top is so pretty! i love the lace details and the embroidery which really makes this top something special. it's true that it is on the shorter side but that seems to be an intentional aspect of the style. i didn't find it to be too short sitting well below my waist line (i'm 5'10""). i usually wear a medium in retailer clothes and this top is no exception it fit perfectly! i know this will be one piece i wear quite often!",5
I just loved this online and love it in person. so feminine and delicate. just perfect for summer get togethers.,5
"I wore this dress yesterday for the first time and got several compliments. its unique and super-pretty in person. it hides flaws well and the material is nice. i must have bigger arms than the model because you can barely tell from the picture what the arm slits look like. i don't mind the way they look, but..the way the piece of fabric there grazed on my arms all day kept making me feel like my bra strap had fallen down. speaking of bra straps, the neckline is wide and i felt like i kept havin",5
"I bought this to celebrate my birthday! i get a new ""suit"" every year. it was a milestone birthday and this dress did not disappoint.",5
"Fits perfect. i'm 5'3 and the size 2 regular fit perfect. not too long it too short, just perfect.",5
"I laughed to myself  as i pulled these jeans on in the dressing room, expecting them to look ridiculous. instead, i was amazed at how well they fit, how cool they looked, and how comfortable they were (two sizes smaller than my usual).  yes, this 66 yo woman rocked these jeans!  i love the intricate whiskering, raw leg opening, and worn, dirty wash.  usually i do not like the dirty look, but this is good dirty. try them on:  you may just fall for them.",5
Love these jeans! the material is soft and very flattering on the hips.,5
Bought this dress to wear to work. love it! great buy,5
"Nice dark indigo with minimal fading. medium denim thickness, with stretch. i bought size 25 and it is snug, but doesn't squeeze. my hip is 34.5"" and 28"" waist. love these. i will be getting them hemmed up to ankle length. i am 5' 5"" and find the little kick out at the ankle (from getting them shortened) to be very cute and classy. if you keep them full length to your shoe, they will have a slightly baggier bootcut look. these remind me of my point sur hightower straight leg jeans, with maybe an",5
"I love this dress! it is a very casual and loose fit, which makes it super comfortable. i highly recommend it since it is versatile for fall and spring and can be styled quite a few ways.",5
"I purchased this tee in the blue and it is so very cute. its such a soft thin tee and a delight to wear on these hot summer days. i went with xs on this one and i still have plenty of room.. i have paired it with jean shorts, capris and it goes really well with the pilcro hypen chino shorts.",5
"I wasn't sure about this dress when i ordered it online, but thought i would give it a try. i am 5'2"" (ordered an xs) and thought i may be too short to pull something like this off, and that it might look like a moo-moo or maternity dress on me. but, i absolutely love it! my husband does too...very sexy and low-key. i wore it for the first time today and received 5 compliments within an hour! this is going to be one of my favorites!",5
"I love this top! it's very delicate and pretty. flattering cut. the fabric is sheer, so wear with a cami or a pretty bra.",5
"I ordered an xsp online, which is my usual size, and it fit perfectly. it's that unique and cute kinda piece you expect from retailer. if you're going to wear a t-shirt, might as well still have a little detail and style.",5
Beautiful color and soft texture. this piece is flattering and can be worn in many seasons.,5
"This top definitely drew my attention when i walked into the store. i loved the back and the fabric is super soft/silky. i tried it one and the usual 0 - fit nicely, i don't have petite to compare, or 00, but i decided to stick with 0. it will look so nice with white shorts (or navy# or jeans or even my denim pencil skirt... why i decided to buy it #i really must avoid the store!)

115 lbs for reference...",5
"I was attracted to the colors when i first saw it...then i saw the back of it! the largest sz in the store was an 8.i had to order it, and got a sz 10. i then returned it for a 12 in order for it to drape properly in front. shorter than i usually wear, but worn with a higher waist bottom it fits nicely. and that back! not only is is striking, i am able to wear my regular bra under it, and the straps don't hang out.",5
"The fit is so bad and the construction is very poor. i'm 5'1'', 100 lbs, ordered xxs petite. 

first of all, when i button this, there is extreme gaping going on. the vest runs narrow, yet tall?it shifts up my torso if i move at all, making the gaping even worse.

the ""skirt"" at the bottom is made of a very cheap, thin, slightly sheeny material that you would find at a flea market. it arrived unbelievably wrinkled and crumpled, and it was just so thin. it did not meet as closely in the middl",1
Got for a mother  day gift.  think  she will like it because she always at the beach and is very happy go lucky new mother.,5
"I was immediately drawn to this top in the catalog. when my local retailer had it in stock and in my size, i tried it on. it fit so well - the front wasn't too low and the back was fantastic with its multiple straps. i wore it the same week to a dinner with friends. i like the multiple prints and the navy blue edging. i bought the turquoise necklace too because it topped off the look so well. the fabric is silky but washable. the top is very well made and fun to wear.",5
"Love this! so colorful and cute! will look great with shorts this summer, and will keep me cool in the city in the summer heat. thanks retailer!",5
Love the fabric. comfortable to wear with jeans or a dress. good for those cool fall mornings.,5
I was drawn to this blouse because it was silk and looked so well made. the color palette is an added bonus. i knew for my height to size up because it looked short. i tried on the 12 & felt it was still to short. i would have to wear a 14 or 16 to get the length i would like. i think overall this would be a great buy for a person with a smaller bust or shorter. i am 5'8 1/2 & a 36d.,5
"I've been stalking this top online and finally went into the store today to see it.  i'm so glad i did!  the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and very lightweight.  the cut covers a regular bra pretty well (a big plus!) and makes my arms look good!  i can't wait to wear this, it will be a perfect dressy top for the higher heat days!",5
"Omg so i never pay full price for a t-shirt because it's just a t-shirt but there are exceptions for every rule. i can't believe i am saying this but this shirt was worth it! it is true to size (a relaxed fit) so if you are in between sizes, you could comfortably size down. the colors are just so darling. love this. not disappointed.",5
"Other reviews are right, it is a little short in front. but it's such an adorable dress that i don't care! i love the material. super soft.",5
"This is a beautiful blouse. great colors and detailing - i absolutely love the design in the back. will look great with white skinny jeans. it does run a bit on the short side but i have a long torso and it still works. i waffled between the 6 and 8 (am usually an 8 and a full b cup).  in sleeveless tops i really like the arm holes to be snug enough to cover that unattractive part between the underarm and breast, so i was considering the 6 but ultimately decided the 8 did so with a bit more comf",5
"I like this layer for fall for many reasons. first of all, the color is a beautiful fall color. the design of the vest is flattering when wore with skinny jeans or leggings. the weight of the vest is perfect for the cooler weather. it is not too heavy, it's fairly lightweight. i am a size 6 and the small fit perfectly.",5
"Flowy, comfy plaid dress perfect for the fall or winter. front is much shorter than the back - at 5'8"" the front is nearly too short on me, but works with a pair of tights. dress has a cami slip underneath, which is needed as the blue detailing across the chest and down the center is sheer, adding to how special the dress is. can be made more or less casual based on accessories and footwear!",5
"The material is velvety smooth, and not quite so pink as pictured on the website. more of a dusty brown rose. well made, nice fit. flattering on my petite frame. a wonderful third piece to complete or elevate an outfit.",5
"I absolutely love this vest. it fits extremely well and falls nicely. i find the collar/lapel billows or flaps out and away from the interior of the vest and i wish they were sewn or secured down. when you tie the string around your waist, the lapel doesn't lay flat, but if you style it like the online model and tie the string off to tighten around your waist, you get a very flattering look. the color and fabric is great quality and really nice in person. i'm overall really happy with this vest.",5
"These embroidered jeans are very nice. they also exist in a lighter wash which i prefer because it shows off the embroidery better. the embroidery is dark navy which is almost not visible in these darker jeans. i guess if you like something very subtle these jeans are for you. i personally would have like a more contrasting color either white or red for the embroidery. these jeans are loose and expand with wear, it is perfectly ok to size down.",5
"I really wasn't sure if this dress would work for me, so i was very excited when i fell in love with it! i haven't experienced any quality or tearing issues with it as one reviewer noted, thank goodness! i love the color scheme and versatility of this dress. i have worn it with tights, a belt and short-heeled ankle booties to make it a little more dressy. but i most love it with some funky jewelry and leggings, wearing it more tunic style. the slip underneath is a great feature as well! it does",5

the colors and pattern are just like they are online. the length comes right to to the top of my knees...i am 5'7"". a couple of things to note: the sleeves are narrow,. if you have skinny arms, no problem. the fit across the bust is snug enough that if you have a large bust, there will probably be a gap at the buttons. there are gathers at the shoulder giving the sleeve a slight puffed shoulder. if you",5
My favorite jeans i have ever purchased! they fit just right. i wear them everywhere.,5

"I'm so disappointed. the dress looked lovely in the box, but when i started to unbutton it to try it on, two buttons split in half! it's going right back.",1
Love these jeans for summer! i followed the advice of previous reviewers and sized down to a 26. after wearing these for a few hours they stretched a little and fit great!! they look sweet with the palo alto blouse and the embroidered edessa top. highly recommend!,5
"I've been eyeing this for months and finally bit the bullet and am so happy i did before it sold out! i love it. i was afraid i couldn't pull it off because i'm 5'3 and very petite, but i don't think it matters. it feels so light and airy and i can't wait to wear it at the pool and the beach as well as over some white tank tops and jean shorts. great piece.",5

"Maeve is hands down my favorite clothing brand so i am a little biased but this is just the cutest top! i saw so many pics of this top in the gallery that i had to have it. i waited for it to go on sale and ordered it in my usual size 6 which normally is perfect in maeve tops. this is just a little snug in the shoulders but not enough to send back for an exchange. if your on the fence, go for it!",5
"I love this top...i waited for it to go on sale, and it was well worth it. it has a peplum bottom and it is slightly longer in the back. i found it to be true to size but if you are going to but reaching up, the arms do run a little tight. overall, the mock neck, button closure on the back, and the feminine flare of this top create a beautiful classic look",5

"This is a gorgeous dress, but i did title my review ""worth the trouble"" because of the buttons which a few other people mentioned. i ordered this from the website and when i tried it on at home, a button snapped right in half. my mother put on all new buttons that were stronger but look exactly the same. of course, i shouldn't have to do that to be able to wear the dress, but i love eyelet and was willing. the new buttons cost about $2.00 so not a big deal in the end.
 i agree with another revi",5
"Absolutely adore this dress. details, fabric and deep pockets. here is the caveat at least for me. i am a typical size 6 and ordered the dress in a size 8 for a little looser, casual fit. the 8 is so small i can barely place over my shoulders and cannot button. i have reordered a size 12 and 14. perhaps the dress i received is not tagged properly. so disappointed as the item is on backorder.",5

"I saw this en route to the dressing room at an retailer store and picked it up to try on. despite the store only carrying this in petites, i tried it on anyway and didn't want to take it off! it's very wearable and comfortable. the sides have boning which keeps the fabric from riding up or down. i have a little postpartum tummy and the shape and pattern conceals that nicely.

I'm super happy with the way these jeans fit. i typically buy ag jeans for fit and quality. this pair is extremely comfy with the right amount of stretch yet still somewhat relaxed. they do run a big large so i sized down and they still fit great... lots of compliments!,5

"I had been looking at the dresses and jumpsuits from this designer for a while and decided to order this jumpsuit. i'm usually an extra small in jumpsuits, and wasn't sure to get the 0petite or 2petite. i'm 5'3 and about 115 lbs and the 2 petite is perfect in the legs and waist, but a little wide across the chest (i'm a 32c). the material is soft and feels very nice and like good quality. it's perfect for dressing up a little in the summer and i'm going to think of ways to transition it to the f",5
"I ordered this online, and was pleasantly surprised when i received it. i'm about 5'5 and 140 lbs and the small fit perfectly. it is very flattering, and i can't wait to wear it!",5
"This is a truly beautiful jacket that goes with so much - dressed up or even over something casual. and either way it is comfortable without looking frumpy, soft and conforms to your shape without being sloppy. i would say it does have more of a 'sweater' feel to it but with the zipper can easily pass as a jacket. it's lightweight but enough to keep you warm on a spring or fall day. i would say it fits pretty true to size. i got the ivory during the big weekend sale (extra 40% off) but even at $",5
This is a 3-season item that can function as a cardigan or a jacket and will look equally good with jeans or with work slacks. the seaming gives it a bit of structure. the asymmetrical zipper gives it a little twist. the texture gives it interest. i bought it in navy and i'm considering the ivory.,5
Although beautiful colors this eyelet dress is quite heavy and the buttons have no give- one of them literally cracked when i tried to unbutton it. unbuttoning it was difficult due to the tight weave. it just misses the mark and will be going back.,1
This top is great for those days when you have nothing to wear. just throw this on and get ready for the compliments!,5
"Looks exactly as it does in the pictures. very comfortable, loose flowing, and has a slip underneath it. i'm personally a little hesitant to buy clothes online because it's always a guessing game when it comes to figuring out what size. with that, i have wide hips/big thighs so i tend to vary between medium and large, but thankfully the medium fits like a glove!",5
"I wanted to love this blouse, but the peplum came too high up on my waist. i have a short torso and i'm busty, so the placement of the peplum just didn't work for me. it is a very pretty color and fit fine in my normal size, but the peplum just didn't work on my short torso. i think this would be a very pretty blouse for people with a different body type than mine.",5
"Super cute, casual top. i'm usually a medium and this fit perfectly (5'9"" 145 lbs). it's not quite as long as it is on the model, but cute nonetheless.",5
"I saw this top online and loved it. i wasn't sure about sizing and because i don't live near a store i decided to order two sizes. i'm 5'8"" and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops. the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders. i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully!",5
"I am a brand loyal ag fan. best washes, best pocket placement and these are no exception. they do run a little big. i usually wear a 26 or 27 in the stilts depending on the fabric content. i tried these in the 26 and 25. both fit, but i went with the 25 because these will stretch at least 1/2 size. the distressing is the right amount, however i gave 4 stars because one area is directly over the knee which i don't care for. solved it by having a seamstress reinforce the back of it with a similar",5
This dress is unique and lovely! it is a one of a kind dress. i found it to be true to size. the only downside is the quality of the buttons.,5
The nolan's are my favorite pair of jeans from any brand. they are skinny leg but not too tight and the material is oh so soft. i buy 1-2 sizes down as they stretch out a lot.,5
This top is perfect to dress up and dress down. pair it with high wasted pants and you are set!,5
"I got this sweater in white and i love it. the photo online doesn't do it justice, it's not frumpy at all and looks looks great zipped up because of the slanted zipper. my boyfriend calls it my claire underwood sweater.",5
"This is a wonderful top! the fabric is soft and comfortable, with a beautiful drape. the pattern is very pretty, the curved hems are very flattering, and the top is versatile. it can be worn with shorts, as shown, or a skirt with a belt or pants. i have pilcro wide leg pants in orange, yellow and green, and this top looked amazing with all of them. a great little find!",5
"Love this tank, i am petite and this was the perfect length for me, i wore it with white jeans and a blazer.  love the print!",5
"Beautiful dress! beautiful color and design. as the other reviewer says, it has an expose good quality gold color zipper on the back that doesn't show in the picture, however, it adds to its style and beauty! i love the dress and so happy that found it in my size finally!",5
"These shorts are great, both the design and fit are beautiful. i would say that these run true to size, i bought my usual size, 26, and they fit perfectly. they fit a little high waisted, which i love. the material is so soft and are so comfortable. i would recommend these shorts if you're thinking about it!",5
"So pretty and flattering. it's my new favorite blouse. it's also really comfortable. i do not tuck this one in. i love the knit material makes it extra comfy and breathable. the colors are very pretty and wearable. the quality and cratsmanship are impressive. it has a straight bottom hem and slight boxy cut which i like. i am 5'3"" and weight 126 lbs. i ordered the small , but i was going go a slightly bigger comfy fit. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.",5
Love this top. got xs fits perfectly. wish it came in more designs,5
"Beautiful shorts. i'm 5'3"" 130 lbs and athletic/muscular build. the 4 fit perfect which is my true size. great print that will go with plenty of different colors. i feel like you can dress it up or go more casual.",5
"Tried this on to see if the size works in regular size, and i love the fir, it si very feminine and flattering. i will have to go back for it. both apttenrs are really nice, and it also comes in balck in my store.

neckline is super flattering.",5
I ordered this top in xl in the navy print. it fits true to size. it's made of two very soft materials. the printed part looks like sailboats to me. it doesn't wrinkle or have a static problem. the solid knit portion is a good quality too. i love the styling details of the ruffled neck and the middle pleat. it's flattering. i like how the details make this a dressy version of a t-shirt while being very comfortable too.,5
"This jumpsuit has the best fit i could ever imagine for a jumpsuit. jumpsuits are always tricky for me, but this one fits like a dream. i would say it runs true to size, with the exception of being a little bit big in the chest. you could go braless with this jumpsuit as there are nice little cups for the girls, but i put on a strapless bra just to fill out the top part. that's not typically a problem for me being a 32d. i don't think i could size down though or it would be too tight in the wais",5
"I am not really a fan of jumpsuits/rompers/etc. but i love this jumpsuit. very good quality and design. fits well, but i thought the 4 was pretty large for a 4. i mean, i probably should have gotten a 2 (which was sold out), but i don't usually have to get a 4 tailored. i did in this case, but it was still worth it.",5
"These pants are fabulous ! i want more colors !
and i got them on sale !!",5
I will find myself reaching for this top time and time again,5
Great cut and high quality fabric. the top gives you a nice hourglass shape and i love the way it hangs half-way down your butt.,5
"This must be the only structured t shirt at retailer at the time of this review. i love it. the neckline is perfection. the ruched sleeves are long enough to cover my upper arms. i found it a bit see through, and added a white cami.

sizing: i ordered an xs. normally i wear a small in retailer brands, and a med in most other brands. size small t's have been too large lately. i'm 5'5"" tall, 135 lbs, 35-29-36, 34d, long torso, narrow across the shoulders, and short arms. 

fit: loose fitting t's l",5
"An adorable tank...wearing it right now!
fits this curvy girl well, though may consider wearing a tank underneath, as the keyhole does show a bit of cleavage.
if in between sizes, consider sizing down.
perfect print for summer.",5
"I am a jumpsuit convert. i tried it on ""just in case,"" but was amazed at how easy and effortlessly adorable it is. i purchased the black, petite 4, and love that it is super versatile in terms of seasonality and styling options. i have an hourglass figure and the draping and fit of the piece work very well.",5
"I bought this top in lavender. this top is light and smooth on your body and true to size. i'm 5'4"", 34dd, 150 lbs- m fits well. it hides the imperfections in the tummy area and i find myself going for this top a lot. it's a very easy to put on and take to it off.",5
"One of the worst shirts i've tried in a long time. i don't know how they managed to give it a little shape on the model. in person it is sleeveless, huge, short and wide.",1
"I really can't say enough about them. they have the perfect amount of stretch, are so comfortable and they keep their shape really well. i would say that you could wear them 3 times before washing. also, the color is perfect. they are tts and even allow for a little extra holiday weight without becoming a torture device.",5
"Since there isn't one where i live, i ran into retailer while waiting for my daughter to pick me up. saw this and bought it off the rack w/out trying on. had to get a m as they were out of s, and yes, it's a tad large on me, but still glad i got it. i think it will be a nice transition piece into fall in hot texas. love how the linen drapes and it makes me feel a bit more dressed up than a cotton tee. the ruching on the sleeves is an extra nice touch.",5
"I tried this on in the store on a whim. it is so flattering, soft, and pretty. i generally wear a size 12 and bought a l although the m might have fit, also: it's got plenty of room. the chiffon yoke is not particularly sheer and a nude bra strap is basically invisible, the jersey is adequately opaque so no camisole needed. my dimensions are about 40""  bust x 33"" waist.",5
"I've been stalking this beauty since it came out and when i saw it went on sale with an extra percent off code i knew i had to purchase. well worth the price i paid, a bit steep at full price. 

i went with a size medium- i usually take a small/2-4 in retailer tops and these days i'm around a 32c. i'm also tall with long arms. the design is very forgiving with the cropped sleeve and non-closing front so you have some wiggle room. it fits me like it was custom made. 

the material is a lightwei",5
"Note: the inseam runs a little longer than stated above. if you are truly a 29"" inseam, you may want to get the petite size. i purchased the petite small, my inseam is 27"", and the trousers hit the ground in stocking feet. however, the length can be changed depending on where you wear/place them on your hip.
i've worn these trousers at home and around town with ease. they are a wonderful cold weather, go-to wardrobe staple. i wear a nylon trouser ""slip"" with them to prolong the need for cleaning",5
"I saw this in my local store last night and was instantly drawn to the color. it is more greenish than yellow. i say this alot but this was so much prettier in person. i would not look twice at it online- the picture does it no justice. i am not a pancho person, but this looks very luxurious and expensive and it feels so soft and warm. i tried the xs/s and it fit perfect - i am typically a medium in other brands at antrho. it is boxy, but that is the point of a sweater of this type. it will be p",5
"I tried on this jumpsuit in black and it was absolutely beautiful. i liked that it looked sort of like a tuxedo, i wore it one time and received so many compliments. when i washed it, however, it shrunk almost 1 size! the pant legs were high water. i even tried washing and restretching it because i loved the jumpsuit but it wouldn't budge, i think because rayon is not stretchable material. to my disappointment, i returned it. i really wished it would have worked out.",1
"Great causal tank! the back is a bitter longer than the front - i'm 5'6"" and the back-model shot was right on for where it his me at the hip/butt. the material is a poly/spandex/rayon mix that feels predominately like polyester and rayon and has a little bit of give.

 i go between a medium and small in most retailer tanks and like to achieve a look that is somewhere in between form-fitting and flowy (quick stats - 130 lbs, 34c) and the small was perfect without being too tight across the chest.",5
"I can't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top. the style is so flattering, it doesn't bag out to make you look pregnant. the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch. soft fabric, drapes beautifully. the armholes are not oversized. the fabric is opaque so no camisole required.

i am 5'5"" and 120 lbs. and 36a. i purchased size small.",5
Love it. goes well with a lot. super soft,5
Beautiful colors. lovely style. feminine and has a nice flow. fiattering fit in back also. nice holiday blouse. really very pretty.,5
This is a beautiful color and nice heavier fabric. love the style. armholes not too big. the body is loose fitting at torso but chest area is fitted at 36 c size small . i love this top with skinny jeans or pencil skirt as shown on model. top looks just like it does on model as far as fit.,5
Fabric is so comfy! color is gorgeous! fit is flattering for large chests.,5
"This top is an amazing go to piece, and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto. i will say, that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear. therefore, it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time. good staple for a great price.",5
"Lovely silky top (100% poly). i typically look better in more cool tones. this top is neutral enough that i could pull it off. it really has three very pretty, complimentary patterned fabrics. the front v is very deep and the arm holes are quite roomy so either size down or plan on wearing a cami to conceal cleavage and bra.",5
"I had a hard time deciding to order red or turquoise, as both colors are really nice in person. the black, of course, is a classic. another reviewer found the top to be small, but i found it to be a little big on me in my usual size. not too bad, but a little bigger than expected.

teh neck part is effortless as there is stiching to help the colw effect stay in place. the fabric is thin though, so may show things (thinking bra ripples, and perhaps some other ripples in front tummmy). keeping it",5
"True to size
neckline is not too low so it's great for work
got the red and it's a lush deep color
quite happy with this purchae",5
"This is a very comfy dress/tunic. i like to wear it with leggings. washed well, nice color, looks nice with boots. nice find!",5
"This is a beautiful tunic dress and the detail makes it so soft and feminine. i would never have bought it online because it looks so plain but in the store today just couldn't believe how pretty. i'm mature so i plan to wear with black leggings and a nice scarf but could easily be worn alone or with jeans. i think it will transition into spring for two season wear. i'm small but large busted (size 6, 32 h bra)and the small was perfect. can't wait to wear it!",5
"I am pleased with this modal cowl neck top; it is a very basic but is a nice addition to my wardrobe. the cowl is just right-not overly 'chunky' or awkward; it drapes nicely and lies flat against my chest. this blouse 'softens' the face-just what i was looking for-i needed a soft-looking black tee to go with a skirt i have and wanted a bit 'more' than a basic tee but nothing overly frilly or ruffled. this blouse filled the bill quite nicely. it is a very soft modal fabric and fits tts. i am 5'5""",5
"Wasn't sure what to expect - but got this on sale, and glad i did.
it is much prettier in person. soft and silky.
great fit also - and versatile (mix and match)",5
"I saw this jacket in stores, but did not buy it. i went home, but could not get this trendy jacket out of my head. i returned to the store the very next day and purchased this item. i am very pleased with the quality and think that the fit could go well on most body types. i got the denim color, which may not be the best color for all, but i love it because denim is timeless and very versatile. i would suggest this to anyone and could not be happier with this! go out and buy it now, you won't re",5
"I bought this during the 25% off dress sale, but alas it is a chemise and not a dress. nevertheless i love it. in a smaller size (i exchanged an xs for an xxs) it is much more flattering and has more shape. the different fabrics make it interesting and fun.",5
This is a great top so beautiful with bright colors and sheen. my only complaint was i am dd and it was tight so i had to size up!  otherwise my brests would spill up and out!.,5
This dress is perfect and so sweet! i do agree with other reviewers in that it runs about 1/2 to one size large. i run anywhere from 6-8 in retailer dresses and i ordered the 6. if you are usually in between sizes definitely order the smaller size. the smaller size also allows me to go braless even though i have a larger (34dd) chest because of the well-constructed bodice. length is nice for us tall girls as well!!,5
Very pleased with my purchase! the subtle details within the dress add to its simple elegance. very soft and comfortable; definitely recommend!,5
This is exactly what i was looking for! a simple black blouse to pair with a bold pair of pants or skirt. falls nicely and the material is quite stretchy making it super comfortable.,5
This top came in the mail today and did not disappoint. it feels very light and luxurious and the color is just divine. i got the deep red color and it is beautiful. it can be dressed up or dressed down. i ordered my usual small and it fit tts.,5
"I managed to find this huit eden lagoon fixed straps foam bandeau swimsuit in a size 32c and it fits perfectly. my current measurements are 33-25-37 or 38 hips, and i normally wear a 30d or 32c bra.
.
i have a longish torso, yet this doesn't ride up. fits like on the model. there is a thin strip of silicone around the back to keep it from sliding down. the v-shape is held by a hard wire, but it doesn't cut in anywhere. the soft black straps are sewn in and not adjustable but do hold their shap",5
"This dress is very comfortable. i bought both the small & xsmall and ended up keeping the xsmall i am 5'4"" 125 lbs. 34c",5
This is a stylish blouse with classic features as well as quirky features such as pleats and gathers. very flattering fit!,5
Purchased in a small. usually a 4-6-8. i layered over a sleeveless dress and i felt amazing. great for those tighter dresses. the fabric is sheer but not super see through. the tassle in the back is so creative. it closes enough in the back to not look weird. i have so many plans for this piece. black is the perfect color too. the collar colors are perfect too.,5
I eyed this for so long hoping it would go on sale. i finally bought it during the 20% off retailer members day. sized up from my usual size 4 to avoid the buttons on the bust looking like they were about to burst free. the rest still fits way. i absolutely cannot wait for the next rainy day to wear this!,5
"I own two poodles and love anything poodle print. i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale. but it is horrible. the fit is like wearing a pillowcase. it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit. it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short, wide, and wrong. i was in love with the print however i had to return it.",1
"I'm petite and i ordered the smallest size possible online (5'1"" 95lb). i ordered the rain/umbrella pattern which is cute and very ""retailer"" in my opinion. for those who are experiencing ""gapping at the buttons over bust area"" - wear a tank inside and problem is solved! hoping they would come out with cuter prints in the future.",5
"This is top makes me feel happy and pretty! with a saturday/sunday black tank or any cami, you will love yourself in it! tts and matches most any skirt! good price too! can wear with skirts or pants.",5
"I had my eye on the umbrella print shirt for a while. i was able to scoop it at a small discount. i typically get a 2 in maeve tops but per the reviews i got a 4, i definitely could have done with a 2 but i'll probably stay with what i have. adorable print, comfortable, well made.",5
"Perfect shirt for a low-key day at the office. bought in the umbrella/rain (white) print. maeve blouses tend to run a little big on me but that's what i love about them. material is nice, recommend hand wash!",5
Such a cute take on a henley/button down shirt! i first bought the green and blue version in my typical size medium and while it was bigger than i expected it to be i kept it because i liked the oversized/tunic look i got with some skinny jeans and boots. i decided to order this color in a small to get a different look. i'm just as pleased with the fit of the smaller size! i think this size will work better for tucking in and more tailored looks. yea! these shirts are so soft and made of substan,5
"I am rarely disappointed by maeve and this was no exception. i am a 32b and broad shouldered and my normal size 6 fit like a dream. the white print is opaque so no bra see-through. such a cute, fun print! the fabric has a really soft hand too.",5
I had no issues with size or length. i'm 5'9 34c bust and i bought the striped shirt in a 4 and the umbrella print in a 2. the 2 was ever so slightly tight at the second button but i was wearing a heavy cotton cami. i could have worn a 2 in the striped top as well. i am broad shouldered and the shoulder seam in the size 4 dropped a little so there was plenty of room. these shirts are adorable. i usually don't like button downs but this style is very flattering. the material is light and drapes w,5
I purchased this shirt in the black and it looks great. it fits well and the design with the different color dots adds character. this shirt can be worn with anything and for just about any occasion. thanks retailer for another winner!!,5
I love this top and bought my usual xs. i don't have any issues with the buttons gaping but am 34b so i'm not a busty girl. i got the adorable umbrella print and living in a rain forest in southeast alaska it could not be cuter.,5
"I also found this blouse fits well and runs true to size. a size 2 was perfect, not too tight and not too full. the umbrellas and raindrops are so cute and bright. i will wear with jeans or dressier slim pants. what fun!",5
"Based on reviews, i got the medium pink size: 8 petite because some said it was tight in the bust area and pulled at the buttons creating a gap. i'm 5'6"" and 32d. i figured the 8 petite would be big enough in the bust area and the petite would be shorter. it was too big and even though it was petite, still too long. wanted to like it, but at full price, decided to return.",5
This top was a great purchase even though it's a bit expensive. love the colors and the fit.,5
This is more of an undershirt than a shirt. the material is very very thin and it shows everything. it was beyond unflattering on me. don't buy this unless you have a knockout thin body.,1
I have many maeve shirts and this one does not disappoint. i purchased the blue and love it. i do agree with other reviews though that the chest is a little tight while the rest of the fit is small.,5
"I love the way this dress fits and flares in all the right places making it one of the most flattering dresses i've tried in a while. for me, maeve dresses tend to run a bit big, so i sized down to a small (i'm typically an 8-10). the colors are a little deeper/richer in person, which made me very happy. i love the flounce in the skirt - it adds more swing to the dress. the only draw back was the v-neck came down a bit low. easy fix with a cami for work.",5
"I love this cut of shirt. the stripes are fun. i did have to go up a size due to my bust (34dd), which made the lower part a little bit more flow-y. regardless, i still love this top. so much that i have bought 3 of the prints available.",5
"Contrary to what previous reviewers have said, i think this top fits really well, and is very flattering. i also don't find it too long at all. i normally wear a size small, and got this in a size 4. no gapping at the chest, and i'm a 34d. (5'4"", 124 lbs, 36-27-35). and the colors in the striped version are really pretty. i plan to wear it now and right through spring. i did have a quality issue, however. the first one i received had bunched up stitching where the pleats begin right below the po",5
This is a really cute shirt for spring. i love the colored striping and you can dress it up or down. have not worn it yet -- waiting for it to get a little warmer.,5
"I'm a huge maeve enthusiast. tried this on in three different colors, and although these types of maeve tops have had sizing differences from season to season, this top is more true-to-size than others have been more recently. the petite size for me was too short to tuck in, but the regular worked perfectly. the top is roomy, flowy, and the white version is sheer, but a white tank under it would be perfect. the green umbrellas are adorable! a great way to spruce up your wardrobe for spring!",5
I love this shirt! it is so feminine and comfortable! will be on repeat!,5
"I saw this very shirt online & thought it was so pretty. in person, the shirt seems flimsy. the buttons look as though they'd fall off. i also didn't like the cut of the shirt. it seemed to be tighter on top & looser on the bottom. had to return. i couldn't justify the cost with the quality.",1
"This dress has a very flattering cut for hourglass ladies. i am an 8/10 and got the medium. the sleeves are a little blousy, otherwise it is just about perfect. it will look great with boots or booties for fall. i will wear a thin tank with it to work because the neckline is a little deep.",5
"This top is beautiful! it is comfortable - soft and relaxed without being ""baggy."" colors are just as seen on the website...if not prettier. it is a versatile and flattering top; tucked in or not; sleeves rolled up or not; i love it!",5
"The details on this blouse - lace inset in front and sheer back - look just as great in person as they do in the photos. the fabric is wonderful too; the knit has enough heft that it doesn't show every body imperfection or detail in your bra. it held up well through its first wash and ironing as well. as others have noted, the style is versatile - easy to wear with a cardigan or blazer at work or to pair with skinny jeans or shorts on the weekend. i was also positively impressed by the color sin",5
I adore this top. the fit is amazing. the colors are vibrant and will transition beautifully into spring. i think it looks great with skinny jeans. i am built small up top size m and the 6 fit perfectly. the buttons did not gape at all.,5
I got this in the dark coral color. it is lovely. i'm taking it to hawaii!,5
"Love this top, flattering on my post baby body. its feminine and soft",5
"Sizing: i'm have broad shoulders/back, 36c (34d), short waist, and i usually wear a m in a knit top. that's what i bought, so i'd say that this tee is tts. it is a little longer in the back than front, but not as a high/low top would be. rather, it's sort of tunic-like in style. i have worn it over leggings with and without a sweater, and the added length covers me. i admit that i'm a tad on the short side at 5'2"", and that i have no hips (straight up and down) and no waist. my shape is an upsid",5
"So flattering! the length is perfect and hits just above the knee in front (slightly longer on sides).  i was looking for a versatile dress that could be worn to church, work, luncheons, or casual evening events.  this one fits the bill. i love that it pays homage to the boho/peasant trend without being shapeless or making me look too wide. i am 5'6"" (long torso) 132 lbs, 32d and the small fit perfectly. i got the black motif print.",5
"This is a great blouse. the fabric is a fine rayon which is soft and has a lovely drape to it. i have found rayon to be a good fabric all year and quite cool in the summer. i am 5'7"" long waisted and 127 lbs with a slender build so i usually wear a size 6--this fits perfectly as well as being quite flattering. it can be worn loose or belted with a contrasting or black belt over skinny jeans. it would also be swell with a pencil skirt. it will cover any fashion flaws! i usually like to shop the s",5
Love this blouse. it fits well with a slight flare at the bottom. doesn't wrinkle much and washes in cold water perfectly. have had compliments on the style and design. a definite buy!,5
"These are the perfect way to battle the california heat in style- more beautiful than on the picture. you can't see, but there are gold threads running through the fabric. pair with a sandal and a flow top, and i'm good to go!",5
"Love this top! kept looking online, but really wanted to try on. so once i made it to a store, i was so happy they had my size! i'm 5'1"", but prefer regular sizes in retailer for the length. i got the xs and it is a lovely fit, tts. love the colors in the pink top!",5
"I am a 10 m and got the 10. it fits perfectly and there is room in the bust (i'm 36/38 c). the shirt feels very nice and silky up to the skin. i'm just not sure about the print- i got the umbrellas. it's cute, but maybe a little too cartoonish? it does look good with a green or blue puffy vest for colder days...still trying to decide if i should keep or return, but only b/c of the print. i'd love this in some solid colors!",5
"I ordered this top on sale and so glad that i did. i am usually a small in tops, but had read that it runs small. i went with a medium and wish that i picked the small. it is definitely a swing top. it's best feature is the detailing; it's gorgeous. i paired it with jeans and a white denim jacket.",5
"Love these pants! the are super comfy and very flattering, but they are very long. i did manage to have them altered,but you may risk losing the flare, which is unfortunate considering the price.",5
"I really love this dress because it can be dressed up with wedges or heels for a wedding or cocktail party, but could also be dressed down with a cute pair of gladiators. i love the pockets too! i'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone who needs a go-to summer dress for many occasions.",5
"I was looking for a romper for a long time which i don't need to care whether to wear bras after taking shower and relax. because of its design with a line on the top, no worries for a relaxed romper. the texture was not as silky as i wished but you will like this if you want a light on weight.",5
"I can't believe these aren't sold out yet.  i had no problem getting this over my head.  this top has such beautiful colors and embroidery.  quality is good.  flattering on.  at this price, it is probably the best deal i've gotten on anything from retailer.  i would recommend this top, absolutely!",5
This sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings. sundry's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool. the fit is true to size. the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice. i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along!,5
"I really liked the style of this dress. the top was nice and stretchy and the bottom is so soft and silky. i love lace and thought that was a nice detail for the top. the colors are a little brighter in person, the red in the pictures here is more of a hot pink in person. i'm planning on buying some hot pink flats to wear with it at a wedding this summer! 

one reviewer said she didn't like the placement where the dress fell, i have a short torso and long legs, so i like to try to emphasize a",5
I was going to order a size 2 online but decided to check my local store first (hate paying for shipping - especially when so many retailers offer free shipping regardless of the purchase amount). all that was left was a 0 and 10. i decided to go ahead and try the 0 just for size comparison. i'm usually a size 2 but this dress fit perfect in the 0. a 2 probably would have been ok but may have been a bit looser in the top. i love the lace fabric on the top and the contrast it provides to the skir,5
"This is a very beautiful and well-made skirt. it looks a little like ribbon material. it is very think and lush, and the pockets add a little extra special to it. the waist band is very sturdy and it wears very flattering. even putting my hands in the pockets feels very thick and silky. i am 5'1"" with a 27in waist and the size 2 fit really well, just above the knee.",5
"I tried on the xs in store in crimson (i would need petite) - the color and fit were very flattering on me (pale skin). the dress feels very silky, i love the back, how it ties, and how high the neckline was on me in the front. the little flutter at the bottom of the dress is also a nice touch. my only concern was whether this looked like a negligee... i think i would buy it if i had somewhere to go, just not sure the fabric is appropriate for work... 

reference: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26.5 in waist.",5
"The quality and aesthetic of this dress is wonderful. the fit and look are classic. i am 5'10'' and the dress falls mid thigh. this is a beautiful dress for a special event, simple but with sparkle at the neckline and an unusual print. i am very happy with this purchase.",5
"Ordered this top the second i saw it!
i wear a small or med. depending on the cut and fabric............noticed it is cotton and went with a medium.
so happy i went with the larger size.......runs very small, especially in the chest, and there is no give in the fabric.
stunning top but would go up one, possibly two sizes.",5
Wore this dress for my bridal shower and got a ton of compliments! it fits great and is very well made!,5
Very soft and luxe materials and really well made. pockets a nice detail and otherwise a great cut and length. petticoat underneath a cool detail too.,5
"When i saw this dress i knew i had to have it! i loved the colors and design. i am a wedding planner and dresses with pockets are my ""uniform""
i was a little concerned after reading some of the other reviews, but i ordered anyway and am glad i did! it fits perfect and looks just like the photo.",5
"Great for hot weather, dress up and dress down! don't need to decide what to match with and bottom or top!",5
"This skirt is exactly as i had hoped it would be. the zipper works great, the material feels nice, and the liner is attached to the skirt so there is no bunching effect. after the first time i wore the skirt i went out and bought more tops to go with it. i highly recommend this skirt.",5
"I'm a little heavier than i'd like due to postpartum fluff and have to gradually lose because of breastfeeding, so i look for bottoms with enough give in the waist that will still fit once i reach my goal weight. for reference i'm about 33"" waist x 44"" hips with a goal of 31"" waist x 40"" hips, so roughly a size 12/14 getting back to an 8/10. i bought a medium and it stretches enough to fit. this skirt is a solid staple and the colors are just lovely. the flat elastic in the waistband doesn't rol",5
"I paired this gorgeous top with a black v-neck cardigan, mother lookers and black booties and felt and looked so totally feminine and amazing...i honestly lost count of the compliments that i received!!  beading is sewn on tightly, and the stitching on the embroidery has no loose ends.  i am 5'3""/108 and took the regular size small.  highly recommend!!",5
"Super comfy, easy to put on, and super cute! you can dress it up and dress it down! i'm usually a size s and the small fits fine, but i think the xs would have fit better.",5
"Love this skirt! very fun and feminine. it is a great fit and i love the layering contrast of stripes. length goes right to below my knees, which is perfect for me! i am petite and curvy.",5
Great material. quality and versatility is there. it is easy to get in and out of which is hard to find and the fit is adjustable at the waist.,5
I can't say enough good things about this romper. i am curvey on the bottom and have never been able to get on board with the romper trend because all the ones i had tried were too short or were clearly made for models and teenagers. this romper is a great length and style for all ages and body types. the material is so soft and is the kind of material that won't easily wrinkle. it can easily be dressed up for a night out with wedges and jewelry or dressed down for day with  flats (and maybe eve,5
"Yes,you need these, so comfortable - and wash up perfectly - workout, walking or great to sleep in",5
"I would of paid double the amount for this romper. i am a medium and the medium fits perfect. i am a little long in the torso, so some rompers aren't comfortable but this one is! this is going to be a summer staple for sure.",5
Perfect for end of summer going into fall. very soft and pairs great with skinnies and sandals or booties. still trying to find a sweater to layer it with. runs true to size. i am an xs/0 and got the xs. i was a little worried because i am so petite i usually swim in tops like this. it fits perfectly and comfortably.,5
"Finally a jumper that works for me! i am 5'6 but i have a long torso so most jumpers ride up in an uncomfortable way. this one is perfect. the material is light and perfect for warm weather. the top is very adjustable for all different chest sizes. i personally think the pant length looks better if you are under 5'8"" because it comes down closer to the ankle but then again if you have long thin legs you might not mind the bottom hitting at your calf. i can't say enough good things about this jum",5
I can't believe this top hasn't sold out. it is a great casual top that will go well with anything. i agree with previous reviewer that talked about sizing up to cover straps. i did size up to a large but it didn't get huge around the midsection. i got the red and it will go great with pilcro khakis or denim.,5
I love this dress! it is an easy throw on and go dress. the fabric is very soft and the cut is faltering. fit is true to size.,5
"Not sure why this says ""online exclusive"" as i bought it in green in the store. i also saw it in a mustard color at another location. but in any case,
this is an adorable and flattering dress. fabric is kind of a chino. weighty but not too heavy. great color and design. runs a bit small. my normal size was snug and i thought that in the summer heat i would not want it that clingy so went up a size. i love it and would buy it in more colors!",5
"This is a great dress! it's cut nicely, is flattering, and it's not too short. if i put it on, i look put together in a matter of seconds. the dress fits true to size. one thing, i would agree with the other review that this is not really ""tweed."" instead it is made out of a patterned stretchy material that is a little thinner than tweed. the colors are really beautiful, and while the blues and reds are more intense in real life, it looks terrific.",5
"I found this to be a very feminine and flattering dress. it is prettier in person. i have the ivory and black print. i agree that it takes a bit of effort to get the slip positioned properly. i might wear a different slip, however i was able to get the slip to stay in place. the print and fabric are a nice quality. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p. i bought this in the 0 regular because i like my dresses a little bit longer. i think it runs just a little bit small.",5
"Got this in the ""dark blue"" wash; there is significantly less color variation than pictured online; it's a medium wash, and incredibly soft. i typically wear m or l in this brand due to very broad shoulders and muscular biceps: if you have a similar frame and you typically wear one of two sizes, go with your larger size.
this feels incredibly silky. it's lightweight, so it can be worn (almost) year-round and will layer well over say, a tissue-style turtleneck in the winter. it's longer in the b",5
"Perfect for when you're a guest at someone's home , having guests or just lounging !  prettiest set you'll ever own... you'll feel as if your on vacation even if you're not. i wouldn't travel without this set !! highly recommend. love.",5
Horrible fit not true to size again aline outside of the dress and a very tight camisole underneath,1
This was my first time ordering or even knowing about retailers. what a pleasant surprise. i will shop often!,5
"This is a really great top. it is really soft and made very well. it could be a casual top with jeans, or, dress up with some chunky jewelry and cute heels. i wasn't sure which size to get because i mostly get mediums amd i sometimes get a large. i ended up going with a large and it seemed to be just a little too big, but it doesn't have that look at all. it looks so much better in person than on the computer. overall a very cute top!",5
"These are such under-rated pants! i love the fit, style, fabric & everything about them. they are the perfect weight & can be worn with boots, sandals, flats, etc. they run tts - i got my usual 26. get yourself a pair while they last. you won't regret it.",5
"I've had a hard time finding the right jumpsuit and haven't ha a lot of luck with retailer clothing lately, but this is perhaps my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i'm petite and busty (5'2"", 34c/d) and was pleasantly supposed at how well this fits. the pattern is a bit faded (like the best kind of vintage find) so it works for someone short like me. and because the back has a tie closure, it can adjust as needed -- i'll be wearing it with a sports bra that crosses in back with 4 straps, whic",5
"I don't have anything but raves here.  this is a perfectly proportioned jumpsuit of high quality fabric in a neutral color (which is like a denim looking blue color with a beige starburst pattern, much, much nicer in person than in the product photo and has a really neat slightly nubby texture that adds interest).  it's easy to get in and out of.  the back of the waistband is elastic and stretches, so the only thing you have to do is tie the back, which is really easy.  the top (as someone menti",5
"This is one of the most flattering tops i've ever owned. i'm a little confused by the other reviews, because the model in the photo doesn't have it tacked in the back. you can see on the photo of the back, there's a button to pull it in which makes it so incredibly flattering. it's soft and beautiful, but very delicate. i'd wash it separately and carefully, and rarely :) i actually had to return my first one because of a hole in the material. overall, one of my new favorite tops.",5
"I love  this dress. it is beautiful , feminine, and fits perfectly. i am a 4 in a dress size. i have long wait 5,7. . very happy in this simple yet unique dress.",5
"This is my favorite jumpsuit purchase of the season. flattering, casual look. well made light material. easy to dress up or down. can't wait to wear it again!",5
"Retailer is totally killing my wallet because i can't resist these modern-city-meets-prairie-boho dresses. i bow down to the textile designers who created this print, it's stunning. as for reality vs. model shoot, it's pretty much what you see--the colors are spot on, the outer dress is sheer, the bodice is slightly fitted, with a fuller skirt that doesn't poof too much. all poly construction with no stretch whatsoever. i had a bit of a struggle getting the outer dress over my shoulders but once a",5
"I like the soft green color, the chino fabric and the casual vibe this dress exudes. perfect for spring and early summer. runs tts but may be snug for bustier gals. wish this had pockets.",5
"I have an upside-down triangle shape. i am a 4/6 on the bottom and a 10/12 on top. i have a short waist. i have very slim hips and virtually no waist. so, a typical jumpsuit or romper really doesn't fit me. this one is the exception! likely because it ties in the back, but the s fit me perfectly. the bottom half is easy, but not oversized. the top half of the jumpsuit is adjustable, so there is no issue with size. i am 36c on top, but i think that i could pull off the top, without a bra. you can",5
"Wanted a jumpsuit that didn't look stupid on a 50+ year old -- this is it! ordered a large and it is a little loose around the waist, but still fits and is comfortable. extremely well made and very cute. the only complaint is that it is difficult to tie the back.",5
"I love wearing this. it is a little slice of summer, which i am desperately hanging on to. the color pops, it's so very comfortable, & the back is a work of art! can be dressed up with a pencil summer skirt, or down with capri style pants.",5
"I was so excited to receive this dress only to come find out that it was not tweed, not the same colors as the picture, spandex material, the fit runs smaller than most of their dresses and the sleeves are capped. i love retailer and prefer their clothes above all other brands but i was extremely disappointed in this dress.",1
I bought this for myself and my mom and we both love it! i got it in a small and almost wish i had gotten it in an xsmall. it's super comfy and appropriate for work.,5
"The sweater is a great fit and the styling is very original and wonderful. it will be great with leggings, jeans, or even a straight skirt. i would definitely recommend this sweater.",5
Thee are beautiful pants. so soft to the touch. true to color. ca.t wait to wear them in the fall.,5
"I initially bought the red and blue sweater in a medium. i usually wear a large and the medium fits perfectly and is still a bit baggy. i'm tall (5'9"") and so i love the length of the sleeves when they are unrolled. it's a very versatile piece. with sleeves rolled down you can fold the collar so the red is out of sight and just have a navy blue sweater. either look is nice. i loved it so much i bought the black and brown version. also, the fabric doesn't feel thick but it is very insulating and",5
I absolutely love this shawl/jacket! i usually use it as outerwear and it is the perfect piece for those in between weather days in new england when it's too cold for winter wear and not warm enough to go without a jacket. the black/brown works great with whatever you're wearing. so versatile and i love that it has pockets!,5
"This robe is so pretty, i kind of feel like a movie star when i wear it! the embroidered flowers and trim are a very nice touch. the fabric is very light and soft, i'm sure it will feel nice and cool on those hot summer nights ahead. the fit is true to size and is actually a bit longer than what is shown on the model. i am extremely happy i decided to make this purchase.",5
"I usually wear stevie's in ag, but when i saw the prima was on sale i decided to give it a try and i""m so glad i did! they came today and i tried them on, i will say the rise feels a little higher than mid-rise, but it's so soft and stretchy i didn't really care. they're definitely skinny but with so much stretch they feel like a comfortable legging that doesn't fit quite so tightly. the color/wash is great too. for this price, these are awesome. i ordered a 29, same as my stevies and it fit per",5
"I ordered this dress for a special event and i am so incredibly happy with it! i am 5'1"", 97 lbs, 32b and ordered a 0 petite. fits like a glove. the dress has a slight give to it, but main dress fabric is a thick material so order your usual size. fits close through the waist and flares out below. the length hit above the knee so not too short, although i wouldn't want it any shorter. my main worry was whether my bra would show in the back, but i had no issue. overall, the dress is stunning with",5
"Buy this robe before its gone! my friend and i each bought this robe... it feels amazing and makes a girl feel pretty!. i bought the xs/s (34c, 26"" waist), but i tried on the m/l and could have made that work too. love!",5
I've been looking for a nice affordable robe for awhile and this is the one! it's so soft and the design makes you feel fancy when you wear it. perfect for lounging doing my nails or wearing a face mask.,5
"Love this sweater/jacket. fit is good and the colors are just right, not to bright and not boring. the shawl color takes a wee bit of adjusting but is worth the extra minute or so. also has a hood built into shawl that when not in use can not be seen, very cool. have worn it a couple of times and always get compliments.",5
"This dress is a keeper. fits true to size, comfortable and love the pockets. it can be a casual day dress or add some jewelry for a night time dinner out. i was concerned with the fabric being a velvet material but is very light and comfortable",5
"This pullover blouse is a real winner. it is soft and figure flattering, but not too clingy. the neck looks good open or closed with the small button. all in all, it's just a very good design. 
note that the notched thumb holes are completely optional. the holes disappear, without being visible, into the sleeve when they are not being used. also, the sleeve pulls down when the thumb holes are used, so there is no extra length in the sleeves (as may be suggested in the photo).",5
Really striking. even prettier in person. color is beautiful. told my husband this is a half-way-to-christmas present!,5
"I love ag jeans. these jeans fit snug but not confining. they have some stretch to the material so that you can move with ease. i love the way they fit my body with one exception. unfortunately they did not have the petite available so the length is about 3 to 4 inches too long on my 5'3 frame. the dark blue makes it acceptable for casual friday (yay). i am 5'3 102lbs and even though i will have to hem them, the overall fit was great!",5
"This dress has pretty colors. the top fit well but the bottom looked like an upside down umbrella. it has enough material to make 2 skirts and the big pockets on the sides make the skirt stick out sideways. the photo of model is from side, not the front. very unflattering on me.",1
"Love it! easy to wear, true to size. there is a slight texture which makes it very cozy",5
"I bought this in the sable green. you can wear this blouse tucked in, or out if you're wearing something lie leggings. it is comfortable and the color is very flattering.",5
"I received my coat today. in love! it is so flattering in so many ways. it may not be form fitting, but i love all the details and i'm a sucker for hoods. this is a great fall/winter coat especially if you live in the south. it will probably only work as a late spring/early fall coat for you northern ladies. my only compliant is that the arms are too long, but i'm only 5', so it'll possibly be the perfect fit for someone else.",5
"This is a great ""go to"" top. it isn't too low, too tight, too dressy or too casual. i'm 5'1 and ordered a small petite. it fits perfectly, especially under the arms, (where tops always show my bra) & it doesn't go ""too"" low. i have to admit, i purchased the dusty rose color, i'm not sure how great it complements my olive skin, but i love it anyway.",5
"I got this in white and was surprised to see that it fits me. i am very petite but with a 32d bust and purchased the xxs. this fit me perfectly! the fabric is soft and kind of silky, the straps were not too long, the hem hit just at my hip line. i am buying the other color!",5
"I ordered this top online during the mother's day sale, thinking i had found the perfect white staple tank i wanted for summer. i had this top on for barely five seconds before i knew it was going straight back. the quality of the fabric and the overall design are both very good. but the problem is that the top comes with an under-layer up top. this is normally a good thing; extra coverage in a sumer top generally means you ca go braless. the problem is that the top layer of the shirt is so shee",1
I love this dress even more in person than in the photo! it is more sleek and fitted than it appears on the model. the seams are flattering and the fabric is lovely.,5
"I fell in love with this online and i'm so thrilled that it's even more beautiful in person. it is a stunning, very dark teal velvet with the most gorgeous embroidery. perfect fit, quality, and nicely lined. a keeper for years to come! i think it's true to size (for reference i'm 5'1, 100 lbs and the 0p fits perfectly)",5
I bought this vest hoping to be able to throw it over long sleeve tops for fall and it's perfect for that- it adds a bit of detail with the buttons and pockets on the vest!,5
"Unbelievably soft fabric that doesn't feel like it will pill. i ordered dark grey. i'm 5'3"" 130 (just after baby) and size m fits well, super-flattering. doesn't smash my buns. the seams are in all the right places to flatter. styling is between ballerina and badass, as i think the ankle wraps look a little tough. i highly recommend.",5
"Hi, this top is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. very feminine. it has a small amount of swing without a large amount of fabric. love it.",5
Love this top. looks much better on than the hanger. the color and fabric are very nice.,5
"I was hesitant to buy this top after reading previous reviews, but i love it! granted, i am two months postpartum so i am looking for tops that are airy (it's summer in socal) but cover up my tummy. the material is soft and stretchy and it does have a loose shelf bra type inset---so not a real bra but at least something there. i wore a free people bralette with it and it looked perfect! really happy with this top!",5
"Absolutely in love with this dress! perfect to wear to work or for a casual brunch or cookout. i'm a 34b, 27"" waist, and 36"" hip and 5'3"" and went with the xsp. very impressed with the quality and well worth the sale price.",5
"Great material that drapes nicely. super comfy, feels cool but it's a thick material--not at all see through. so happy i purchased this. and super easy with the snap buttons, but the shirt is very well made and high-quality material. would look great on all sizes and shapes. i'm 5' 4"" and about 140, small chest. normally i'm a s or m with tops but bought this in a m because i like a slightly oversized shirt, though it's also made to be looser and longer. still, at 5' 4"" i'm not swimming in a m.",5
"This gorgeous dress is what retailer is all about. natural fibers like silk and rayon and cotton, unusual beautiful prints and colors, not your average day to day find. i bought this in my usual size l, and while i could use a bit more room in the top, it works either unbuttoned one button, which shows the beautiful turquoise slip that comes with it, or, i am going to stitch it down the front so the buttons won't open and the top won't gap at the bust. i am 5'5"" and the dress is a perfect l",5
I bought this shirt to wear under a black skirt suit. the fabric does have some stretch to it however if you have a normal to above boob size ... beware! i have a 36d chest and the front of the shirt hit me to the point that i then looked preggers. it was one of those situations which reminded me why i do not buy empire dresses. in addition the fabric felt like something my grandmother would have used back in the 60's. it was a thick polyester type material. i think this shirt would still work f,1
"I picked this up on sale and was glad i did - the material is just the right thickness for some of the chilly days we have here in spring in the northeast. the fit is right on, but size up if you are unsure or inbetween. the detail down the back is adorable and adds a point of interest to this sweatshirt. the fit is boxy - but i think it compliments and balances the overall girly design.",5
Great casual pant for the summer. wish there were more colors. white or beige would be great. comfortable. great fit. sizing is consistent with my normal designer denim sizing; 26. i'm also 5'3 and the regular size pant is just right for me.,5
"I was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package. the fabric is extremely stiff and thin. the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through. the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders, therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children's clothing. i also ordered the matching pj pants but didn't even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater",1
"I just received these in the mail, but had to send them back to the store because they are too big. i usually wear a 28 and sometimes even a 29 in most ag and mother jeans. the 28 in these were loose in the waist and overall baggier than shown in the picture. i ordered size 27, so hopefully these will fit just right since they are really cute. the beige color is just as pictured and almost a rust color which goes well with a dark grey top as shown.",5
"This dress is beautiful and unusual. i think the colors shown in the picture are a little brighter than the dress i bought...the turquoise and gold seem slightly more muted in person, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. there are sequins along the shoulders of the dress that you also can't see in the picture, but they aren't gaudy or too stevie nicks-bohemian. i didn't find the bodice of the size m too tight as another reviewer noted...it's' my normal size, and though i'm a little chesty (32-34",5
"This dress hangs like a sack. it really needs a belt to give it some shape. i tried to style it with one, but then didn't look right either. i did like the slip that came with it. i'll be returning it.",1
"I thought this was more like an oversized sweatshirt. not at all! i'm either a m or l and i bought a large and that was too small and too tight. it is more fitted. if you are looking for something more comfy, don't buy. however, if you want more of a fitted blouse feel, then go for it.",1
Material is thick and warm. print is very pretty. i received complements from all age groups. fits a little boxy but it works.,5
Ordered my regular size 27. they were tight when they arrived but they stretch - a lot. i like the looser style so was vey pleased but think they are at least a size larger after one wear.,5
"This is one great button up shirt ! the fringe hem is a fun little detail that gives this shirt some serious versatility. it looks great layered under jackets and sweaters, with a came underneath, or all on its own. the fabric could be a bit thicker. i am between a small and a medium ( a 6 or an 8), and bought this in a small.",5
Love this shirt! it is great quality and fits true to size in a comfy not too fitted way that a button down should fit. i love that it is a classic white cotton shirt with a modern edge with the little bit of fringing on the bottom and sleeve cuffs. it's great to wear with jeans or leggings and i can even see dressing it up or down depending on the accessories worn. i have already gotten lots of compliments when wearing it....everyone wants to get it for themselves! i'd even get it in another co,5
"These are so comfortable and surprisingly flattering! i bought the taupe in sp, for reference i'm 5'2', 115 lbs., curvy on bottom. i was afraid it would give me a ""bubble butt"" and it didn't. could be dressed up with right shoes/accessories.",5
"I did the happy dance when the dress arrived, but the very sad dance when i tried it on. unfortunately, instead of following my instincts, i took the review here (and reviews from some other sites) to heart and ordered a size bigger than usual . huge mistake, as in this dress was huge -- much too big to alter and keep the integrity of design. for reference i'm 5'7, 130lbs, 34c. i usually wear an 8 dress (due to a very large rib cage). i ordered the 10 but was literally swimming. i think a 6 woul",5
"I ordered the ""red"" in a size xl. the fit is perfect--it matches the model's photos. the material is so soft. it's definitely a cozy fabric. the red color description is wrong but the photo accurately shows how it's really an orange shade. the color is cheery since it's bright. it will be great to use on cold days.",5
"I bought this dress for a christmas party and received lots of compliments! at 50, even though i live in a cold climate i was looking for something (not black!) stylish, and comfortable that i would not roast in at a party! it is a beautiful green color with nice embroidery front and back and the shape is very boho. i like my dresses a little more fitted so i bought the xs (and i am usually a small ...so size down!) and had the waist nipped in a bit by my seamstress to give it more of a flatteri",5
I love this top! tassels are not too big. material is thick. i wish is was a little longer though.,5
"I really like this top, a nice spin on a class sweatshirt. fun with a pair of jeans or cords.",5
"Great everyday dress. i bought a small (5'9, 135lbs) and it really fits nicely.",5
This is the cutest cardigan. i purchased it in the red. i wish there were more colors,5
Bought the camel color and love it. nice for cool evenings and mornings spring through fall. soft and comfortable. delicate yet not too much so that you wouldn't wear often.,5
Great with leggings.perfect with cold weather. hard to find if you have large calves .retailer is only place i could find leg warmers to fit. they are nice and thick and warm. and true to color.,5
"I really love this dress! it's very flattering and comfortable, and all the buttons keep the wrap in check. i've gotten lots of compliments on it. also, it's got pockets!",5
Love the shirt! fits great and is so cute! a must have for fall!,5
"I ordered 3 different styles of jogger pants and these were definitely the ones to keep! true to size and instantly comfortable due to the soft material they are made from. the taupe color i got will go with a lot, too. these are great pants that you won't be sorry you bought!",5
"Beautiful sweater, perfect length, surprisingly warm",5
I ordered two of these in orange as holiday gifts this year. both were loved! great style and quality will hopefully make this a go-to sweater for both recipients.,5
"Believe the reviews - this dress is very flattering, great quality, and an excellent print (i got the polka dot). i was concerned about the wrap front since i am busty - 32dd - but this looks great, is appropriate for work. love!",5
"I love the mustard color and fun boho details of this shirt, however the sizing was a little weird. i ordered the small petite first and it was just too short (which is rarely a problem i have), so i ordered it in the regular small. it's perfect in length, but a little loose on top, which i'm fine with. overall, very happy with this purchase and have received many compliments on it.",5
"This vest looks exactly as in pictures which is a good thing for online exclusives. i love the fact that it's lined and the texture and color of the fabric is very nice. has a good, solid quality feel to it. it does not have any buttons or belt that comes with it but looks perfectly fine just left opened. i wore it with belt as well and it add to the structured styling of the vest. more on the conservative side of retailer.",5
"I have been searching for the perfect white shirt. this is it! i love how the collar lays and the longer length and frayed hem are perfection! the fabric is super soft, too. i am very pleased with this purchase!",5
Great sweater for casual days. just the right length and fabric weight. very versatile. fit is true to size not oversized.,5
"Love, love love this top. it's got a little bit of a native american vibe without being over-the-top. i tend to wear a small in retailer, but the medium was the way to go for me. it's not long, and the style errs on the not-tight side. if you can go between two sizes, don't get the smaller one. and i love the shade of yellow!",5
"A great wrap dress with many buttons, the dress stays on better than any other wrap dress i ever owned.",5
"Great for the beachy business look. classy, but immensely comfortable. i feel like i look sharp without having to sit poker-straight.",5
"This top is as pictured. i'm 5 feet 120 pounds. the small petite was a great fit. the material is cozy, soft and somewhat thick. dress it casual with jeans or elevate it with slacks.",5
Received this dress for christmas and fell in love. the detail and fit is perfection. the buttons go all the way to the bottom of the skirt so no concern for pesky flyaway exposure should the wind blow. the detail on the arms w the buttons is also cute and i personally loved the longer sleeve that almost comes to my elbow - it's very flattering. overall a great little dress!,5
I came into the store to try another dress on and was given this dress to try. it is perfect! i paired it with black tights and tall boots for a family photo. i got it in the wine color. highly recommend and very fun for winter. it does run really large. i usually wear a small but got an extra small.,5
"It is such a cute dress. the mulit-colored aspect allows me to wear many different color shoes with it. the dress can be formal or informal, and it works for a myriad of occasions. please purchase it!!!!",5
"This is a lovely sweater - the ""moss"" color however is really camel, which is what the photo indicates. it fits tts, is all cashmere, and is knit in a brioche stitch that gives it loft and texture that can be seen well in the detail photo. i am generally not a fan of raglan sleeves but in this case it works with the overall construction of the sweater - one that features interesting decreases, lines, and angles. it is very soft, warm, and lightweight, and can be worn as a casual piece or dressed",5
"I purchased this in grey and wine and both are wonderful. the boiled wool is light but warm and not itchy. fits nicely through the bodice and flares out to create a nice shape. the pockets are terrific and lay nice and flat. i'm short but the petite was well above my knee. i could have worn petite small just fine. it fit nicely in the bodice - the smaller size brought the seaming up a bit higher to form a more empire waist, but i chose the petite medium because i wanted it loose through the wais",5
"I bought this on a whim.  i have a difficult time finding a great fitting suit, especially online!  

this suit is structured so well.  the material will seemingly last way longer than most of my other suits that are priced much higher.  the material i feel holds in my stomach. i have a large bust and it is comfortably supported in this.   

the design is so cute and i love the way the way crisscrossed.  it makes a one piece feel less like a one piece.",5
"I have had a lot of complements while wearing this dress. i purchased it in the grey. other reviews felt that this dress ran large. i agree that it might be a little larger than other retailer purchases i have made but not by much. i purchased it in small (usually what i wear in dresses) i'm very tall at 5'9"" (mostly legs) and the length is great. also the neck line is perfect on me and i have a fairly average torso length. . i am very happy with the purchase.",5
"This is a deliciously soft and cozy cashmere sweater. the cashmere is thick and knitted with a ribbed brioche stitch. the sweater is true to size, though a bit boxy, so i did size down for a slightly more fitted and flattering look. the sweater is a little on the short side, but i'm petite, so i thought the regular xxs was perfect. the stitch details are lovely and it it so soft i want to wear it every day. it did start to pill after one wear, but this is the nature of cashmere. i'm very pleased",5
I did not like this cashmere sweater at all. i ordered the pink which was more of a peach color. although the color was very pretty the material was very thin and cheap looking . it was also very short . not worth the money even at 40% off.,1
"This dress is really beautiful. i have already worn it to both an engagement party (fancy) and just out to dinner (casual); it fits most occasions, depending on what you pair it with, which always makes me feel like i have gotten my full money's worth. i've gotten several compliments on it; the best one being that it looks as though i was wearing a piece of art! the outside material of the dress is silky in texture and has a nice sheen to it. it looks true to the picture on the website. the dres",5
"I love this dress so much that i purchased it in both grey and wine. i find the cut very flattering and slimming, and love the pockets. it works great for northern california winters, with tights, boots, boiled wool sweatercoat over it while outdoors, and on its own indoors. i wish there was a long-sleeved version. i feel exceptionally cute and cozy while wearing it. good job, sparrow! btw, i bought the other currently offered sparrow wool dress (the mock-neck dress), and this one is just an inc",5
"Overall, this swimsuit is what i needed and have been looking for. i normally wear bikinis but i needed a one piece, and i wanted something unique and different. i ordered the chevron print, and i do love the colors and ""retro"" look of the swimsuit. if i could change a couple of things, i would have the legs and booty slightly more high cut -- but not much. and i might have wanted the option to take off some, if not all, of the straps. other than that, i do love it...and i doubt that anyone else",5
I really liked the design. ordered a medium which was huge. also thought i would not be able to tolerate it because of the material -- a bit itchy. returned it.,1
"Such a unique mix of prints but it totally works. much better and more vibrant in person. true to size. fits more like a maxi on me since i'm 5'1""",5
The sweater is very soft. it has an interesting pattern. i purchased the neutral color in size xs which runs tts. it's definitely a cozy sweater to wear this winter.,5
This top is super cute. the color is beautiful and the lace detail is very feminine. im a 36c and got the size small. it fits great.,5
"This bathing suit is so cute. it fits me great. i'm 5'10 and about 130 and ordered a medium. my only complaint is that the outside straps sometimes fall off my shoulders, which could be annoying if you are doing anything active. but overall a great, modest and cute swimsuit.",5
"Les fauves is another version of last years larkhill swing dress but better.  one, the swing has less to swing, but in a good way!  they reduced the voluminous amount of material while retaining the fun swing aspect. two, the dress is shorter so it's more flattering to the vertically challenged like me. what's the same?  still wonderful silk, discreet pockets, beautiful abstract floral print and those horrid little buttons that are difficult to fasten on the back of a tight neckband collar.  i h",5
"The moment i laid eyes on this beauty, i was mesmerized.  there's so much going on with the print but it all works.  it's so fun and flattering and versatile since the variety of colors go with just about every thing i own in my closet.  it can be fancied up or casualed down depending on your shoes and accessories.  like the first reviewer recommended, size down.  i bought an 8 instead of 10 and my bust is 36dd with a wide rib cage.  i really wish this was a midi on me but alas no petite sizes w",5
"I dig this jacket very much because i can wear it like a thick shirt or as a jacket, and the removable collar gives even more versatility. i am short so i opted for regular xs (i'm 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the bit of spandex stretch helps me achieve the fitted look without looking too tight. i love military green color, it's a happier neutral than black or brown. without saying, it goes with everything and flatters all body types.",5
I'm 5' 120 and the 4p fit like a glove. i have a bigger chest and there is no pulling on the buttons. the colors and fit on the dress are perfect. i had so many compliments when i wore it!,5
"Found this dress at my local retailer. . it was one of those dresses that just catches your eye.. very,very, beautiful print. . the dress is loose and flowy and feels so comfortable on. i purchased it without a second thought. i am 5'1"" and usually wear a 0 or 2 and the 2 was a better fit for me. so breezy and cool for summer.",5
"This dress does run large, but i'm wearing it loose and flowy. bought it for desert trip music festival, with booties and a hat or headband, very hippie chic. my husband thinks it's adorable! the prints are darling.",5
"So cute, so comfortable, so pretty - so i guess i love everything about it. it is not too short on me and i think you can wear it in many ways... thought of adding a vest - thought of boots - can't wait to wear it. i agree the material is substantial so it isn't flimsy for fall or winter. happy with this purchase. runs true to size. i went with the op. i sometimes chose regular length, but this one is just right in the petite. i have long arms but these sleeves are just right. i am 5 ft. tall, b",5
Great piece. using as a night gown. slept in it last night. like a dream.,5
"I like the make of this dress, the fabric is thick and light at the same time.
the cut is loose and flattering. the different patterns are also very fun. colors are gorgeous, nice details. the buttons are sturdy. 
i tried on both 0p and 00p - not much difference in the 2 (i would go petite if you are on the short side). the 00p was just a bit snugger near the =chest, but didn't gape. the waist is definitely meant to be looser, so don't expect a fitted dress. length was slightly above the knee",5
"Very quick delivery. ordered sunday and in my mailbox tuesday before noon! nice fit, length is perfect. i'm 5'3"" and the regular size 6 hits just above the knee. one thing is the nice little button in the back fell off just as i was going to try it on. found on the floor and i will just sew it back on. other than that i love the print and everything about the dress. true to size. ?? retailer",5
"Great basic tank with a bit of a 'flair' at bottom that makes it super cute. will layer with cute bra most likely. the coral color is great, too. very pretty. i also got the white.",5
"The fit on this shirt is bizarre--it very much resembles a nursing top (but wouldn't actually work for that purpose). the side visible in the picture is nicely draped, but the other side can flap open and is completely different. i tried two different sizes and both were equally unfortunate!",1
"This dress is even more beautiful in person. it fits true to size and drapes nicely from the body without being tent-like, as some swing dresses are prone to be. the material is very nice and the pattern is stunning and unique. as someone else mentioned, you can pair this with a cardi for work. it's also perfect for a night out. it's easily dressed up or down. and looks amazing with a skinny belt. i'm happy i bought this one!",5
Love this dress!!! thought the colors would be too much but it actually isn't and is just so cute. got a ton of compliments on it when i wore it! the material is light but not see through at all. the length is perfect and comfortable to sit around in. this will be my go to dress this fall!,5
"Oh my! this dress fits wonderfully on! so ready for autumn! i have a big bust, this dress does not split at the buttons.",5
"I know this is labeled under activewear, but the fabric is a dream, it's incredibly flattering and could absolutely be worn in any outfit! i just bought the moss and may end up getting the other colors too. i generally am a l or xl, and the large fit well. it's alined and has a bit of stretch to it. it's so comfortable! highly recommend!",5
"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim thinking it be a great throwback to the 70s. it is actually very flattering on, with the lines running down vertical, giving a slimming look to any figure. it is also very soft and comfortable on, and has nice, large pockets on the sides. it doesn't look dated at all once on, and i'm sure will get plenty of use as the weather warms up. for reference, i'm 5'7"" tall, and weigh close to 130 lbs., and found the small fit well. the only drawback was the pice, but i",5
This is a great top. i almost walked right by it because it is so simplistic compared to the other things in retailer. i just wanted something super casual and this fits the bill. the fabric is a dream and it has a nice drape without being overly voluminous. i usually love white tops but the white was my least favorite. i ended up getting the moss and the gray. i could have gotten either the xs or the s. i went with the small because it was a little longer and had a wee bit more room in the upper,5
"I generally wear a 27. jeans fit perfectly. skinny, but not too skinny.",5
"Saw this dress in the retailer catalog and tried on in store. didn't need a dress but ended up purchasing as will be wearable for summer/early fall. seems like a print dress cut and style that will be used for many seasons. outer fabric is a bit delicate/may snag, and a bit wrinkly as another reviewer said, but works with the dress.",5
"I own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance. i was hoping these would be the same. i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front. i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric, it is tacky!",1
These citizens of humanity jeans are indeed pricy but worth the money. they fit slim through the hips and not too loose in the legs to make you feel like they are huge...very versatile and look fabulous with a cropped sweater or even a hip length top. add a pair of chunky shoes and you have a great look. i even tried them with dansko clogs and they looks cute. it's a great break from skinny jeans and much more chic than boyfriend jeans.,5
What a great purchase (especially on sale!) as this tank can't get more comfy. the material is soft and great to wear during those warm weather months. love it!,5
"I stumbled upon this dress yesterday at the store and fell in love with it! i wore it today with boots and received tons of compliments. it is light, comfortable and flattering. i love that it is machine washable, too!",5
"This is a beautiful dress. it fits true to size. i have some issues around the middle and this just flows away from the body. i am 5'5"" and it falls to the knee on me, longer than pictured on the model. the fabric is a nice weight that can be worn three seasons. the print is pretty and romantic. i'm planning to wear this to my daughter's very informal wedding and know i'll be comfortable and look put together. this was a lucky find!",5
"I saw this top online and fell in love with it, as i live in white cotton comfy tanks, but i was concerned that it might make me look like i was wearing a tent from the side profile since i am top heavy - 36d, and i happen to have this problem with some tops and dresses. so i went into the store to try it on in a size l and i was shocked how not only did it not look like a tent it had a slimming effect! i felt so attractive in it i had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror (believe me this",5
"I loved this dress when i saw it online! i could not wait until i see in one of the local stores.  i bought it today! unlike other reviews, i think this dress runs large. i am a 4 and bought the zero. maeve tends to run large on me. i would suggest that you try a size smaller. it looks very flattering!",5
"This dress rules.  so comfy, and versatile.  flattering cut.  great with flats, wedges, booties, boots with tights.  easily my new fav.  runs large.  i am usually a 6/8 and the 4 was perfect after i steamed it.  no button gap either, i am a 34c.",5
"I got one of these tanks, and went back and bought two more online. i have the gray, green and white. the white requires a undershirt for me, but that's no problem. the shirts are darling, they're under activewear and i think they could be used that way, but i definitely don't. they're simple but have a nice flow, and the front and back are perfect. i love the material and the colors. i would buy more if there was more in more natural tones, i don't love bright colors but i love the green, white",5
Loved it! i am curvy and it is very hard to find a dress that looks easy and at the same time shapes you. the various cuts of the different prints are placed in the right place in the body . easy dress and beautiful. there should be more dresses in this style in different color combos.,5
A seasonal must have. nicely made. medium weight. cozy. buttons to half way down. i am petite and the xs fits with enough room for layers underneath. highly recommend.,5
"Fit is oversized but intentional. flattering on. love the neckline. modesty might call for a tank top underneath if bending over. fabric is soft, stretchy and has a good quality heft to it.",5
These pants are comfortable and cozy. great for lounging around and cute enough to wear out of the house to coffee or running errands. i'll be wearing them a lot.,5
"Love this top.
perfect under a jacket for work or on its own for date night. i have a long torso and the length is perfect. so dainty and different!",5
"I purchased this dress for myself. however, when i tried it on at home the length was too short. i gave the dress to a relative who is petite and the dress fit her perfectly.",5
"I have been eyeing these pants for about a month or so; every time i stopped by my local retailer store i would check them out but never actually bought them. well, today i finally went for it and i am so glad i did! the floral pattern is very feminine yet unique and the colors are uplifting and cheerful for spring. the material is very soft, light and flowy and i'm sure will be comfortable in the heat of summer. the only drawback i found was that the fabric is not very stretchy and i like to be a",5
This cut and shape of this skirt is very flattering. i am normally a medium but the small fit and looked much better- less bulky. the material is nice almost sweater like but not so heavy. it's a very versatile skirt. highly recommend.,5
Love this dress. going to wear it for thanksgiving. love the material.,5
"I was so excited about this top, and so disappointed when it arrived today. the lace part is lovely, but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides. it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated, and there is no way to get it to lay flat. the back center section is pleated. why couldn't they have had the pleats all around? this will be going back with much regret.",1
"I love these sleep pants they are the perfect length. i'
am 5'10 and slim these fit great, its so hard to find pants that fit tall slender women.",5
"When i unwrapped this a chemical ""stink"" hit me that amost knocked me over. it was really unbearable and i m not overly sensitive to smells. second it was way too large with a boxy unflattering cut. the waist sits very high at elbow height and every below the waist the material balloons out in a rediculous manner. i wonder if they had it pinned down somehow on the picture here. with a more flattering cut i might have decided to wash it a few times to get the stink out. i do not recommend this fo",1
"First mermaid-ish skirt ever that's flattering enough to pull off with a curvy lower body. the material is light-weight sweater knit that hugs in all the right places and its unique cut along the bottom make it very in the moment. the color is a rich, deep, gorgeous brown with subtle highlights that draw from whatever top you pear with it. runs large so size down.",5
"Love the mara hoffman basketweave bikini bottoms in fractals red. i went to her website for the size chart and got these in a size 'm'. very good fit, just a bit cheekier than her classic cut bikini bottoms. i got them with the matching basketweave bikini top.
.
i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 to 38 depending on where i measure. upper hipbones are 34""; fuller thighs and bottom, so i never know what to order. i think a size 's' would be too skimpy so i hope these hold up well in the waves.

"This is a beautiful well designed top. the pattern is laid out to match on each side. the back has a narrow center insert of sheer fabric, for an interesting detail, with wonderful construction. this sheer fabric is also added to the bottom as an edging . this measures only 1 1/4"" wide and lays flat and finished off well. the sleeves have excess fabric for comfort but do not make one's arms look heavy. the unusual neckline shape in the front is well sewn and lays flat nicely. i think this top is",5
"I ordered this dress looking for something to wear out for an evening. after seeing the other reviews i wasn't sure about it, but i was very pleased when it arrived. i find it is elegant and sexy, but also modest enough when i sized up by 1. i normally wear an xs in dresses but found the small fit perfectly. it is form-fitting particularly in the waist and back without being too tight. i'm excited to wear it and think it would look beautiful with a long necklace.",5
"All of my friends loved these pants- as did i! these are so gorgeous. the sequins seem well stitched. the small fit me well- hanging straight as pictured, not too snug or uncomfortable. they hit me at the ankle. there are back pockets.",5
These have been a staple for me the last three years. i have owned three pairs of them in black. i haven't been able to find them in black for some time and i need these back in my life!!! please please bring them back!!,5
These are true to size and photo. i wore them to the opera and cant wait to wear them with sandals and a tee this summer!,5
"These pants fit true to size. i have a small waist and curvy hips, and while i have always loved the low rise ag stevie, these offer more coverage at the back with the same great slim fit through the leg. the length is also great for those of us who are not super tall. the have some stretch but i wore them several times without washing and the never got baggy in the knees or other stretch points. i own two other pairs of ag stevie in traditional denim and they still look great after years of wea",5
"I bought this top on the advice of another tall reviewer and i'm so happy that i did.  this is the perfect top for tall girls.  i did size down from my usual large to a medium. the top was still oversized, but in a very pretty way.  i love the material.  this top is so soft and extremely comfortable. the v neckline is very pretty and not too low.  i can see myself dressing this up with nicer pants for work or with skinny jeans for a more casual look.  if you are a tall girl, this top is a must h",5
"These looked so fun, i had to have them! i usually wear a 14 in pants, but the large fit well. despite a lack of thigh gap and walking in these all night, i didn't lose a single sequin. they're comfortable and get a ton of compliments. if you're considering them, i definitely recommend going for it!",5
"What a great top! i am 5'9"" - 136 lbs with a 34d chest.. and this top looks and feels great on. i am usually a 6 and the small fit perfectly. i purchased the grey and it is a nice medium grey color. the v in front hits in a great spot.. not too low, but just low enough to look feminine. i haven't washed and dried the top yet, so i hope it looks as good after washing as it does brand new. i was hesitant to order because of the earlier reviews, but i find this top really works for me, so i am glad",5
"These are great pants. i was nervous because when i saw them at the store they looked pretty linty but after wearing them a number of times they are not bad. i have to run a lint roller over them occasionally but not more than other black pants. i wear these to work and they are very comfortable. kind of stretchy, but very flattering. the higher rise than the other stevies makes them work really well for work-allows them to look less ""jean"" like. i highly recommend these-can't believe they aren'",5
"I love these jeans, cant believe i never purchased them earlier. i'm always a 30 in paige and ag and this was no different. i will say that i did fit into the 29, so it could be that they run slightly large. the fabric is amazing!! and the white is perfect. love that it is not see through and fabric is substantial.the length for me at 5'5 was at my ankle. i loved them so much that i bought them in white and beige/cream. highly recommend.",5
"I was returning some things when i saw these jeans and had to try them on! they must be magical pants, because they are slimming and very flattering! amazing jeans!",5

"I love the way the neckline is open not too low ! it also falls on your hips just right.

great buy",5
"I think these jeans are amazing. they are very flattering and most of all comfortable. i often will go up a size when buying white but i didn't have to with these. they also relax very nicely as you wear them. buying white jeans has always been a challenge, often they are to thin and not that flattering. i don't feel the same about these, they are the perfect summer white jean. i think i need another pair!",5
"I have owned a lot of stevies in the past. the only problem with them for me has been the rise. i have always thought they would have been perfect with a bit of a higher rise. voila! these have the perfect mid rise (for me). they are really soft. too long for my 29 inch inseam. they bunch at the ankles, but don't drag. i would love for them to have a skinnier ankle, but i also think they're fine how they are. i bought my normal size. they may turn out to be a tiny bit loose after wearing them. t",5
"I saw this top at my local store and tried it on a whim. it is so much cuter in person than it looks online - i wouldn't have given it a second look based on these pictures... it perhaps runs a tiny bit large, but i stuck with my usual size small since it hung nicer on my body than the xs did. if you're thin you may want to size down - i have a decent amount of ""padding"" that keeps me from wanting to wear anything fitted (5'4"", 130 lbs). the little dots are more prevalent in person and the peplu",5
"The dahlia bell sleeve blouse is absolutely gorgeous in my opinion. i have already worn it several times, with white cropped denim or the cropped fringed pilcro denim jeans. it also looks great with the pilcro rolled shorts in navy or white. i took my usual size large, and though the fabric seems like it may be sheer, if you wear a nude bra you do not need a cami beneath. the blue band hits right about the waist of your jeans so your jeans don't show thru either. this blouse is lightweight and v",5

This sweater jacket is beautiful. the picture doesn't do it justice. works very well with a tank underneath and a skirt or over a knee length dress. wore with boots and received many compliments. it's classy.,5
Looks great with jeans for a more bohemian look.  i normally wear a medium but went large to accommodate a 6 month pregnant belly.  the blouse is loose enough i probably could have stayed with the medium.,5
"This is very comfortable, and pretty top. i love the pleated peplum and the flutter sleeves. the v-neck is the right height, and the embroidered polka-dots are very sweet. i got many complements wearing this perfect for summer top!",5
"Great top! super cute. runs a little big, i usually purchase l but the m fit better. it's thin, but not see through, so it lays well.",5
I absolutely love the dahlia bell-sleeve blouse. this blouse has a lovely flow. perfect for fall. sleeves have a slight bell that hang nicely. i would recommend this blouse to everyone!,5
"I purchased this in the ivory color in store and liked it so much i ordered the plum color on-line. i am almost always an xl, but this fit better in the l size. it's very soft and comfy and i love the swingy style. will be wearing it a lot!",5
"This is one of my favorite tops! it is comfortable and an easy ""throw and go"" top. i am a big fan of denim tops and the lace on the back gives it that extra detail and flare. very pleased :)",5
"I got this top in white and absolutely love it. the top can be tucked in or worn out, it is very elegant and will go well with skirts as well as pants and even jeans. can't wait to wear it.",5
"I'm always an xl in retailer blouses, and to be quite honest sometimes the xl are too tight to keep. however, in this blouse the size medium fits me like a normal size xl would, meaning i had to go down 2 sizes. even at size medium the blouse is still very loose and flowy. the body is cut like a trapeze a-line, so very forgiving. the fabric has a lot of stretch to it, so the arms aren't tight. the fabric is very comfortable and the lace detail is nice. just a heads up for anyone who would c",5
"First off, this top is super cozy! i adore an easy top that has beautiful detail - and this one does! the fabric is a lot like a thermal shirt, but not too warm. it's very stretchy!! not sure if it will stretch out with wear, but you could easily size down. the body has a ton of room. because of the cute cut, you could wear it oversized without it drowning you, or you could size down to keep it more slim. the lace is simple and even more beautiful in person! i highly recommend this one - especia",5
This dress is super flattering. i love everything about it!,5
"Color of the dress matches color on my monitor. the neckline is sheer. i am 5'4"" ,125 lbs, 32d and ordered a size 6. i thought it fit perfect. this is a great spring/summer dress and can be worn with dress heels or flats for a dressier look. it can also be worm with tennis shoes (white converse are my choice) for a more casual look.

i think this dress could also transition to a fall/winter piece paired with tights and a suit jacket or cardigan. 

also, i love the pockets, though i do see ho",5
"What a beautiful flowing top. i am either a large or xl in tops but only needed a large in this top. i purchased it in the neutral color, but will probably get it in plum. if you have some flaws in your middle, this conceals everything. the material is so soft. you can dress it up or down and wear it from now until late fall. the plum color was beautiful, but i have more to wear with neutral. a great, versatile top.",5
Really cute stress! i love the pattern and feel that this dress you can easily dress up or dress down. the neckline is the main reason why i bought the dress. it is a dress that hits above my knees so i like how modest it is. the slightly open back is also a nice touch. it's a dress that can easily be dressed up or dressed down. perfect spring dress!,5
I'm 7months preggars and this top actually compliments my belly. extremely comfortable.,5
"This dress fits me perfect. the only complaint i have is that it was a little snug around the neck every now and then. it was a little snug getting in and out of the dress too. overall, the design is beautiful and it is definitely my new favorite.",5
"Usually the whole boho style looks funny on me, but the cut and print were subtle enough for me to pull it off. the colors are beautiful - probably flattering against any hair or skin tones...i took my usual small because the shoulders were generous enough. word of caution - this is dry clean only.",5
"I love these pants. these pants are perfect if you like a slim style, but can't comfortably wear skinnies. i like the heavy weight corduroy fabric and seaming details. i bought the ""wine"" color, but as pictured, it really is rust or copper colored, which i prefer.",5
"I love wearing this pullover with leggings and boots. it's soft, comfortable, and loose fitting.",5
The blue is not see though at all and the length is perfect. so many tops now are on the longer side or have the high/low hems. this one is great....love it. kinda want the white one now!,5
"Bought this shirt in the black. runs tts, very comfortable and flattering. past left of center shirts in this style/fabric seem to run a little large, but i bought this in my usual retailer m, and it's great. very similar to last years style, but perhaps a tad more fitted. i gave it a 4 for quality b/c i have noticed a little bit of pilling under the arm area, but overall, it holds up pretty well.",5
"Love this top! such a pretty color and so comfy. sleeves are a bit long, but fits pretty true, like most left of center. washes and dries in the dryer very nicely.",5
"Perfect for the weekend, purchased the purple, it is a nice soft purple, great with jeans. xs petite was perfect. (115 lbs)",5
Loved it. i have receive so many compliments when i wear this. it fit great.,5
I ordered the orange version in size xl. it fits true to size. the fit on me matches the online photos. it's so comfortable to wear. i love the unique details of it. i've washed & air-dried it too. it retained its size. the color is outstanding. it's such a pretty shade that looks more red online than it does in person. there's more of a darker orange tint to it. i've gotten a lot of use out of this tee. hopefully it'll come back in the fall in more colors.,5
"I'm in love with this print! the fabric is very soft too. as others have noted it is small in some odd spots and a little big in others, but overall my usual size worked out great. i wear it with a cute belt to enhance an hourglass look, because it's pretty drapey. really versatile, lovely tunic.",5
This top is a cross between a shirt and sweater. great length and very soft. it does run a little large so size down if you are n the fence. hangs nicely in the back.,5
"Was looking for a top with this style. i ordered this top wondering if it would fit in the hip area after reading the size chart (it showed a close fit.) the answer is yes! there's room to spare, which is a good thing. i like the nubby front material and the hemline's asymmetrical style. i'll be layering this top with sweaters and jackets all winter. very soft feeling fabric. wouldn't mind another one in a different color!",5
"I bought the grey, which is a gorgeous color. i like the long length in the arms (though i tried it on in different colors and the arm length did very). soft and pretty. i like the length. the back does wrinkle, but i still like the shirt. it's loose, casual and flattering.",5
"It's a little roomy, but this shirt is spectacular.  i've gotten so many compliments on this one, whether worn with jeans, work pants, or shorts.  all-weather.  as other reviewers have said, the material is sort of sleek-feeling - not traditional cotton.  for me, i love that, as i've been able to wash stains out of this shirt more easily than i otherwise would.  i am normally a tiny, tiny petite, but i ended up buying this in the xs regular because the style worked even though it's a bit loose.",5
This top is great to wear to work or for enjoying brunch or dinner with friends. it is very comfortable and pairs great with jeans for a dressed down look. i sometimes wear it under a chambray dress and have gotten a ton of compliments. great purchase!,5
"This is a light, so fun to wear shirt. it's delicate and can be worn to dress up jeans. i would very much recommend it. love it!",5
"I love this shirt. i have it in black and purple. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute long sleeve shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming.
it is more fitted than last years style.",5
I bought this shirt in black and green and now bought the orange. it is casual and stylish at the same time. material is soft. great shirt!,5
"I was undecided whether to get regular or petite. i am 5'4"" but i didn't want it to be sloppy long. ordered the petite xs as other reviewers suggested ordering down and its perfect. length falls on me same as the model above. not heavy and very soft. casual but not sloppy. sleeves are a tad long which i prefer.",5
I love a good white blouse and this shirt does not disappoint. the detailing of the lace and bead work make it extra special. i just love it. it can be dressed up or worn with jeans. it runs a bit wide. i normally don't buy a petite in tops because i am long in the body but i did with this one after i tried the regular.,5
Love this top! the material is very comfortable and it's loose fitting which is what i was looking for!,5
"This is so comfortable, i had to buy another one. looks great under sleeveless sweaters. interesting texture adds interest.",5
"So this top is kind of short, but that is pictured. it hits right where it does in the photo, which i like. it is a sheer material, not terribly so, but you will most likely need a cami, which you could pair a long one with to offset the shorter top if you don't like the shortness. i love the top, it's very pretty detailing, cute, just as pictured. i ordered a size 2 and it fits great. i usually wear petites, but you really don't need to get a petite because it's short as it is. i have broad sho",5
"I ordered this shirt last week, and i wore it as soon as it arrived. it is a beautiful shirt with an original design. it is rather casual, but you can dress it up with the right accessories. the print appears to be navy (it was advertised as black), and it looks great with jeans. i would certainly recommend this item.",5
"This is a really great tunic. purchased it in black and it is very flattering. i love the side slit detail. the material may seem very casual, but it is extremely comfortable and can be dressed up. i'm 5'3"" 130lbs and a s fits perfect.",5
"This blouse is made out of a high-quality material, flows beautifully, and the neutral flower pattern makes its yellow/green base pop. i played with a bow and decided that it looks the best tied lower than on the model to form v shaped neckline. this piece will transition easily from one season to the next and from causal to dressy. for the reference, size 12 was the best fit form my curvy 36dd frame.",5
"I was eyeing this blouse when the catelog was mailed to me earlier this year. i never got a chance to try it on in stores, but when i saw it online and on sale i snagged it. what i didn't realize was the intricate design of this blouse. ithas really pretty lace all over the top and then fine beading securely sewn on. the blouse has crochet sleeve designs and also a very pretty neck bib area. it fits me tts and very comfortably. i love the airy feeling of it and it actually also isn't too long on",5
Love this sweater it's perfect for chilly florida evenings....love the loose boxy shape and it's very cozy not itchy!,5
Luv the loose fit and quality fabric - great piece for layering.,5
A must for every closet. very flattering fit - although i think the white is slightly boxier than the chambray.,5
Super cute and flow. mine had a bit of stitching problem so i am exchanging it for the same thing. fabric feels great. def recommend,5
A great everyday tee!! dress it up a bit with a great gold necklace!! looks nice with jeans and brown boots!!,5
I love this sweater! i have gotten so many compliments. it is so comfortable and unique. i am planning on ordering the same sweater in another color. i wear a small and ordered a small. it fit me perfectly. i shop at retailer for a lot of my clothes because they are well made and different.,5
This sweater is very cute! it looks great with a blouse underneath and open the zipper or it is great with a camisole. you will need something underneath especially if the temperatures are low as it is a wee bit shear. i am a small/medium ordinarily but it depends upon the designer. this runs a little large but keep that in mind if you plan on layering. the price is right and the zipper is aesthetically pleasing. i have the blue and oatmeal/beige color both are great pieces to any wardrobe.,5
"Love these jeans! they fit great, they feel great. i am 5'9.5 135 pounds. they fit everywhere you would like them to. unroll them and they are long! love love love!! so wonderful i just bought my second pair.",5
This cream sweater is a great addition to your wardrobe. the length hits below the waist and the zipper adds an updated touch to the look. is a bit itchy but there's room for a light layer underneath.,5
"I have been looking at this sweater online since it first came out and i finally ordered it when it was 40% off. i ordered a size m petite, sadly when it arrived and i tried it on, it was very boxy, stiff like, and did not flow like it looked on the model online so i sent it back.",1
I can only review the ivory as that was the only color in my local store. this sweater is very flattering as it is fitted on top but has a nice flow over the hips plus the zipper allows for more room or to show off an underlying top. the material is soft and the ivory is very pretty in person.,5
"Just got these jeans last week. love the quality, which is typical of pilcro jeans. i usually have to get a tall size, being 5'10"", however they sold out quickly. so i decided to order the regular inseam in my usual size. they fit great. since they are more of a boyfriend jean, they don't fit too snug. so i'm able to get away with the regular inseam. i'm usually a 26-27 tall, and the 27 regular works. love the cuffs and rise in the jeans. i've worn with booties, heels...and am waiting for warm w",5
"Absolutely stunning. the color, the pattern, the quality. i love everything about this top.",5
"Love the style of this sweater and it just happens to be warm, too!",5
"I love this top. it has a relaxed fit without being frumpy, and it looks great with boyfriend jeans or skinny jeans and boots. it's a great, soft fabric that doesn't require a cami underneath. wish there were other colors.",5
"I was pleasantly surprised by this beautiful sweater! being that it's a wool blend, i thought it would be itchy against my skin. to my surprise, it is quite the opposite. very cozy and soft, with plenty of ""wiggle room"". i'm very tall and having enough length for my arms is always a concern. the sleeves are long and comfortable. this sweater is quickly becoming one of my new favorite ""go to"" pieces!",5
"This top has great detailing and color. does run a little big, but adds to the style and movement of the tank. the stitching around the bottom makes it cute for layering.",5
"I hoped i would hate these because i have a zillion pairs of jeans. as i suspected, they're amazing and quickly became my favorite! they have just the right amount of stretch, so flattering.",5
"I remember the first time i walked into an retailer store: like walking into a dream of all my favorite things. i've finally found a store whose products help me to express myself. as a writer, i love whimsical & out of the ordinary. i have found my honey hole. every time one of the pastel bags w/ribbon handles is past over the counter or i push 'add to cart' on my computer, i do a little happy dance in my heart. my closet is like a candy store filled with sweets & treats. thank you retailerp",5
"I really love these jeans! they are so comfortable and are very flattering. i am 5'10 and a size 6. i bought the 28 regular and they fit perfectly. i have high hips, so i appreciate the mid rise in these. the length was perfect too, so i'm glad i did not purchase the tall. the length was the same on me as in the picture. the jeans arrived uncuffed, and they look just as cute without the cuff as they do with. i will definitely wear them with and without a cuff for different looks. i am very happy",5
"I bought this sweater for my future daughter-in-law for her birthday in coral. she lover it! the contrast of color in the yarn is hard to see in the photos. grey and bright coral, just beautiful!",5
"Just received this top in the mail & purchased at the sale price. beautiful classic piece that can easily be dressed up or down. excellent quality & fits tts. for reference, i'm 5'5, 120lbs & ordered the sp & xs, i kept the xs. the sp had an elastic waist, there was no drawstring. not sure if this applies to all petite sizes or just the one i received.",5
"This was exactly the item i was looking for. simple, black, stylish.  unfortunately the fit is terrible and proportions completely off.  the upper arms, chest and hips were ridiculously tight and the whole look was uncomfortable and flattering.",1
"Let me preface this by saying, im totally keeping this dress!

it is kind of a weird design, but intriguing. i received it in the mail yesterday, i am 5'6"", 125 lbs and have hips. as a previous reviewer mentioned, this dress is more fitted than a swing dress as it appears. fortunately the xs fit me just right - but i cannot gain another lb.

my husband said that i looked like i was in a choir because of the higher neck design and bell sleeves, but he too found the dress somewhat alluring.",5
"I second that above review who states ""worst blouse i've ever ordered""",1
"When i saw this sweater online i honestly didn't think it was really anything special. however, when i saw it in my local retailer store i really liked the knit as well as the color (kind of an off white/ pinkish) i decided to give it a try. i have to say that i really like this sweater a lot. the cut is quite flattering even though it is baggy and it is very soft. i think it will look very cute with a pair of skinny jeans and boots this winter. glad i decided to give it a try.",5
"I have been looking for a vest this winter and i saw this one online. i am a huge fan of swing tops. i don't care for super fitted clothes. the knit says part wool so i was expecting it to be a little scratchier, however when i got it, it is so soft and more cotteny feel to it than wool but has the warmth of wool when wearing it. i really have to try not to wear it everyday. just love this vest! it's my favorite purchase this season. i am a size 10 in tops and i can either do a med or a large. i",5
"This sweater is so much better in person. it is a heavy, soft knit that fits perfectly.i am petite and thin and took the reg xs. it is very flattering and drops just below the hips. the bottom is a bit flowy. i bought the beige and bright pink color. the pink is very dark and bright and has an orangy tint to it. i wear a dark beige cami underneath. super cute with cuffed dark jeans and black booties.",5
Love this sweater! bought it in pink and grey and it looks great with jeans. great quality and true to size.,5
"Purchased this sweater in pink which is a beautiful blend of grey and pink. i purchased my usual size xs and it fits great through the shoulders, sleeves and body. i did try on a s and the body was too boxy. also, i tried a couple of different ones in my xs (along with other colors) and found them to run a little differently so you may want to check this out. the sweater is beautiful and easy to wear. the zipper adds a unique detail which can be unzipped part way to show a tank or just to draw a",5
"I just ordered this item and wore it yesterday. received compliments from my friends. truly a great sweater. feels soft to the touch. i love the cut and how it falls around my hips. sleeves were nice and long. i am a tall lady with long arms. almost 6 ft, weighing about 155. i got the med which was a perfect fit for me. love the off white. almost thinking of getting the peachy pink too.",5
"The are so comfortable, flattering, and i feel i can wear them with a lot of styles: dress them up or down, it all looks good. great product! make more like this please!",5
The pictures of this sweater do not do it justice. i would have passed it over online but it immediately caught my eye in the store. the yarn is soft and cozy and the flair at the bottom adds a feminine touch. zipper is cute. v-neck is just right - it is not too low. i know i will be wearing this sweater a lot - very happy with this purchase! i didn't see the pink or navy in the store.,5
"On the real...i needed a sweater they gave my tummy some room! what yes i'd love some more pumpkin pie. know what im saying?! what appeared to be lack of constriction in the belly region of a tiny model, made me hope with fingers crossed it would look like that on me. please please just swing and not cling. mmmmm...k. the majority (70%) of the fabric content is natural and a sale was going on so i went for it and purchased this sweater online. so glad i did!",5
"This is a fun, cozy sweater. i feel you can dress it up and use it casual too. i bought the ivory in size s, i'm 5'2''. although i put it runs true to size, it's is a tad tight around my upper arms, not uncomfortable. i have normal to somewhat skinny arms, so i don't think it was my body type. i didn't check other sweaters in the same size to see if it was an isolated case. it is to be worn loose, it has quite a bit of material all around mid to lower part, just fyi.",5
"Totally my style, i love how it hangs and is so soft and comfy. material is thin enough to be fairly lightweight, and i was worried about it being clingy -- so happy it's not! body skimming and very flattering for full bust (v-neck helps here) if like me you don't like tight chested clothing. also love the length of this top. i'm 5'4"" and 36ddd, size l fits me just how i like it.",5
"The sweater looked different on each model so i wasn't sure what to expect. luckily, it fitted me similar to the one i was hoping it would, the cream sweater model. i'm 5'6"" and got a size small. i like that it hangs just past my hips and the long sleeves. also, the v-neck isn't too low so i don't have to wear a camisole.it's very cozy and doesn't itch.",5
"I found this set once while browsing the website. i fell in love with it and kept a photo of the set so i could save up to purchase it. as luck would have it, my mom surprised me with a gift card, so i applied it to my purchase. i'm so happy with the set. it's wonderfully flattering, and makes me feel sexy. i want one in every color!",5
Great sweater - heavy without being too warm. great layering piece.,5
"Hard to find longer shorts that i like. these are really cute. i thought from the pictures that the backside would be faded and lighter which i wasn't thrilled about, but willing to order and give a try. great to discover this is not the case- nice regular color on back and no fading. really cute shorts.",5
When i wore this dress i got tons of compliments! the quality is great along with the style.,5
These jeans are perfect in every way. i found that i took one size smaller than i do in the pilcro chinos. they are comfortable and have a small amount of stretch to them. i knew i was buying them the instant i put them on. they look great - highly recommend.,5
"I have a hard time finding jeans that fit and these ones are just right! i am 5'8, 125ish lbs and the 26s fix perfectly; they hug in all the right places and they are the perfect length. i will be wearing them uncuffed. there is no effort required to uncuff them, they're not sewn or anything. they have just the right amount of stretch and love the little cute details throughout them. thank you, retailer, for always helping me find great jeans!",5
"Love these jeans, comfortable fit and material is soft.. fit true to size and have a good rise.",5
"I think this sweater is well executed for what it is--a chunky knit trapeze sweater. i agree with another reviewer that i would ignore this product online, but it caught my eye in person. there was only one of the pink sweaters left in store. the interwoven peachy, heathery color is sweet and flattering. since i'm 5'1"", i ordered had the petite version to try. hope it works out 'cuz i'm eager to own something relaxed and cozy that's actually flattering and isn't a sweatshirt.",5
"As soon as i saw this dress online, i knew i wanted it!  i was immediately drawn to the belled sleeves and lace embellishment along the neck/shoulders.  i ordered online, and was so happy with the fit and quality of the dress.  i am 5'5 and it hits just an inch above my knee.  it's the perfect little black dress for a fun date night or an event!",5
Got so many complements! really comfy but runs big! i'm usually a large and i wish i had gotten the small.,5
"This top is beautiful. everything about it is beautiful. it has lovely detail on the back as well as the front. i chose a size 12 which seems to run true. it fit. however, regretfully i had to return the top. i came back here hoping i could find it in ivory or black... but there's only one color. the dusky rose is lovely, but i'm blonde and true pink is fine; this shade not so good, although as someone else here commented, it is a stunning shade of pink, very unusual -- like old dried roses. i l",5
"This is a beautiful piece. the fabric is a nice weight and the cut of the lace across the shoulders is flattering. the sleeves are dramatic, but not overly fussy. sadly i returned the dress because although it is a swing style (no waistline), it has a very straight cut. i was hoping it was more of an a-line silhouette to accommodate my hips, but alas. if you self-identify as a pear, this may not be the dress for you.",5
The linen fabric is elegantly thin feels and looks lovely,5
"In nature pilco fashion, these jeans are amazing. i wear them rolled down, they have a slight boot cut, but not overly. i am 5'10 and the bottoms fall right to my heel- meaning the hem doesn't drag on the ground-finally the perfect pair of jeans. they also do not stretch out and keep shape after wearin all day! highly recommend, although a little pricy for pilcro, worth the splurge.",5
"There were no reviews, it's an ""online exclusive"" and thought it might look good with a nice skirt at an upcoming wedding. the spandex jersey back looks like sweat shirt material. on the white version of this, it is mismatched with an oatmeal color and white that just looks awful. as a busty 36d i was stunned to find myself swimming in a medium. it does not look like the photograph and the sleeve billow out. i feel like this had to have been clipped and tucked in for this photograph. i'm an anth",1
"I am petite (5'). even the xsmall petite looked sloppy on me. i also disliked the nude fabric under the lace- it made it look cheap. i wanted this to be the perfect lbd, i  just couldn't make it work on my body.",1
"I purchased all three colors! this sweater is gorgeous. i love it. it's made well, all three colors are beautiful and it fits great. it's definitely true to size. i'm thrilled with this sweater. adorable!",5
"This is a love at first sight item! bought that home after seeing it on the model. very soft and lovely! especially love the tie back! i wore it with a t shirt underneath. i am 5'4"" and size small. i bought xs and still a bit long. wish they have petite at the store.",5
Good quality tank. very flowy and longer if you are short.,5
"I tried on this jumpsuit on a whim and bought it immediately. finding a jumpsuit for my body type is hard (small chest, rounder in the middle and hips like whoa) but i have to say this one is ridiculously flattering. love the quality and feel of the fabric. i've worn it both braless and with a bandeau and have not needed to wear a shirt underneath, but then again it isn't a piece i plan to wear to work. i'm usually a sz 8/10 and got the medium regular which is perfect. i'm 5'5 and the bottom hit",5
This is so cute with a shirt or tee under neath. the look is better with a shirt underneath. very adorable for many occassions. i ordered the petite sizing b/c i like my pants more cropped.,5
I am in between sizes (and styles) after having a baby. this dress looks great on my curvy figure and enhances my look with the cinching of the belt and the detail of the flutter sleeves. perfect length and really fits well. i am very happy with it!,5
"This sweater is a great, oversized, warm, and very soft cozy winter treasure. it is very comfortable to wear, and looks cute on. i really believe it would be flattering on almost anyone. i highly recommend it, especially now that it is on sale.",5
This top is so comfortable to wear. the way that it hangs makes it as light as air. wonderful for hot weather. the pattern is beautiful!,5
"This shirt style is boxy, however, the material is soft and this shirt is very comfortable. i love the look of the cuffs. this is a fun shirt to wear",5
"Sorry, but i disagree with a previous reviewer who wrote that this buttondown is sheer and runs large. as for sizing, i purchased my usual size small. the fit is intended to be a bit slouchy, and it fits perfectly through the shoulders and the bust. love the high/low hemline, and the back isn't too tight across my bum. i'll also note that i'm 57 years of age and might tend to be a little more modest when it comes to sheer fabrics. the see-through factor is not an issue with this buttondown. i'm",5
"I love this jumpsuit.

i would like to first say that, while a gorgeous model, i actually think this piece looks even better on different body shapes! 

sizing 
i love the shape, the style, and the comfort. i tried it on in a dressing room where it turns out another woman was trying it as well. i am 5'5"" and usually wear a 4 or 6 and got the small. she was a bit shorter and pettte and it looked fabulous on her! it is loose all over, and so flow and fabulous. it hits me where it hits the mod",5
This top is so pretty in person. it bells out at the bottom just the right amount.,5
"I bought this in store, size xs. i weigh 125-130. it was displayed with a white blouse. i cannot imagine wearing it as pictured. i bought it for work. it has nice detailing, back & side pockets, the straps that tie so cutely in the back is what adjusts it to your body. even at 5'5"", it is still cropped, i look forward to playing with it in regards to flats, heels, boots. long sleeve t-shirts, turtle neckes, even sleevless stuff.",5
"Easter ??mother's day tea??baby shower??
i'm 5'2"" 120# and ordered a 4p. true to size. beautifully made, flowy, feminine. i can't wait to wear this!",5
"These are such quirky pants! they're a lot of fun, well made and i love the wide, cropped legs. they do run small - though most reviewers say they are true to size. i wear a 4/6 or 28, and in these i had to get a size 10. very tight at the waist, even though the rest of the pant flows easily and is loose. great color, they'll be perfect for spring and fall, and you can probably pair with boots in the winter. just a fun staple to my wardrobe.",5
"I saw this in the store today, tried on a small and a medium and a medium fit me better which is unusual. usually i am a small. this top is fitted around the chest and flowing at the bottom, a little longer than usual but the pattern is so pretty that i got it. i am 5'4"" 135 pounds and got a medium.",5
"This is such a pretty dress. i was worried the arm holes would be too big since it was hard to see them in the pictures, but they are perfect! there is a built in red slip underneath. it is so cute on and really flattering by itself or even with some white skinny crop jeans underneath!",5
"Very nice soft fabric, has a nice swingy drape and flair. i use it to work out in , sleep in and just hang out around the house. could be paired with white pink or black leggings and a scarf too. very happy with this purchase.",5
I absolutley love this sweater. is is very cozy and warm and can be paired with many different outfits. i am upset i didn't get one in every color!,5
"I bought this in-store after seeing it online, and am in love with the shape! the cropped legs give it a style advantage in my opinion.  for reference i'm 5'6"" 120lbs and a bcup. i got the xs. 
the torso was too baggy and lost it's shape with a small.  
as one reviewer mentioned it seems to be meant to be worn with a shirt underneath. i've tried with longer sleeved tops and with tank tops and they both look great - especially white. 

it has a modern cut and is very versatile. i plan to wear",5
"Sheer top, runs big, usually i'm a size medium, but got small in these. 
very pretty! great summer top.",5
"I got the small even though i usually order a medium for sweaters because i prefer them bigger and i'm glad i got the small. the sleeves are very long (which i love) and the sweater is also loose fitting (also, love). the color is gorgeous and it is thick but super soft. i wouldn't wear anything underneath it unless tucked in because the front just comes to the top of my pants. overall, it's gorgeous and i would definitely recommend this!!",5
Probably one of my favorite turtle neck sweaters! it looks so chic and cute on!!,5
This fit me perfectly. i'm petite and it is a little long but i like the length. it's perfect! so cute,5
"This top is really great for the summer. the fabric is light and gauzy so it's perfect for hot days. i don't like to wear a cami in the summer and this shirt does not require one when worn with a nude bra. i love the window pane pattern- and the light pink color is very flattering and subtle. i'm 5'5"", 124 lb. with fairly broad shoulders, and wear either a small or medium. i ordered the medium in this shirt and found it a bit large so the small would have worked as well. i would say that your re",5
"I've worn this twice now. the first time was after trying it on and realizing it was perfect. immediately purchased and never took it off. the second time, wore it to my internship (office) followed by museum and a concert. incredibly versatile. constant compliments. 5'7"", 135 pounds, 34 c, 27/28 waist. meant to be loose, carefree, incredibly modern. does wrinkle after long periods of sitting, but not enough to dislike. the biggest complaint for me and my retailer coworkers is that it is an incred",5
"After a few months of coveting, i received this jumpsuit as a gift (apparently my longing wasn't too subtle!) and was delighted to find it didn't disappoint at all! the material has a nice weight and falls away from the body, but still is very swingy and light. it is great for our slightly chilly spring, yet i expect it will be fantastic as the weather warms up. i am 5'6"" and usually a 26"" or size 2 in bottoms and an xs or s on top. i got this jumpsuit in an xs and it fits very loosely (much lik",5
"I really love this piece because it's classic and the style transitions from day-to-night. the color caught my eye first, but once i tried it on, it was knotting the tie in front and seeing the elegant texture it created down each pant leg that sold me. i felt too comfortable to be stylish, but there i was multi-tasking my full-time passions in the retailer dressing room. no big deal. 

i am a tall, size 4/6 woman. for taller girls like me who a) intend to wear a small heel with the piece",5
"This is a very nice top, however, it was too large for me. i ordered a medium and needed a small. i am 5'9"",145 lbs.i will try again with a small.",5
"Ah! i wanted to love this but without anything under it (as pictured), the petite sizing reveals way too much side boob. i am 5'3"" and a small b cup. i ordered an xs petite. it fits but there isn't enough material under the armpits. the fabric and design is great other than this flaw. sadly returning.",1
"At 4""11 i usually have to order items in petite and sometimes still have trouble fitting properly into items but i was able to buy this sweater in an xs! i figured with the high front and low back i wouldn't be able to fit it but it looks great on. not only is the fit amazing, but it feels amazing as well. it's such an easy wear and the high/low look is effortlessly chic!",5
"I love everything about this sweater. it's well made, the color is lovely, and best of all, i can wear it with skinny jeans without feel ""overexposed"" in the back. i think my husband thought it was rather shapeless, but i like the look of a bigger sweater with a skinny pant. a must buy at this great price!",5
"I've been wanting to try the cropped pleated pants style and i like these. the material is nice & comfortable and the bow adds whimsy. compared to other brands i've tried, these pants fit the best. the waistband goes up higher in the back so there's no gapping (a big plus for me). just one thing, i find cartonnier to run small so i would suggest ordering one size bigger.",5
"This was my favorite piece of apparel i have purchased in a very long time! fun, trendy and comfy yet dressy piece. dress it up or down based on the occasion.",5
Fits perfectly and is quite adorable. too keep in mind is that where it's cut off on the leg is a bit awkward if you're not wearing heels.,5
"After reading the reviews i was hoping to be able to try this on in store. i was able to try on a xxs and a xs in the store on the sale rack. i tried both on and i usually will take an xs or small in sweaters. funny, but the xxs seemed to be a little longer in the front and the fit is nicer on me. after reading others review of this sweater i thought for sure it would be super short on the xxs but it wasn't. just goes to show you should always try on first! i did not feel that the sleeves were l",5
"I love love love this dress! it's comfy, light weight (but not see through!), and transitional. it drapes well and accents all those parts of me that i like accented. it's good for lounging with the kids, a run to the grocery store and then sipping wine at a beach. would buy more if there were more colors!",5
"This tunic has nice, soft fabric and nicely done embroidery that make it stand out. it's comfortable and the fabric is very nice, but it is not flannel as advertised. the tunic is made out of a double-gauze cotton, which is a great fabric with a casual look.",5
This is a very flattering blouse. gorgeous detail with the beading!,5
"This sweater is absolutely adorable! i was worried about the layers looking too frumpy but they were not - i normally wear a size medlum (8), but i sized down on this sweater on a gut feeling and bought a small --i didn't want it to be too loose or billowy, and it fits perfectly. will be so cute with jeans but also with skirts for work! you will be so happy you bought this one.",5
I love this! i agree with previous post that say  it is much better in person. the fabric is high quality but not too thick. i bought this to have something light to wear on a trip to italy and it will be perfect. the color is so lovely and the flowy detail at the hem makes it unique. it's a basic without being basic. i'm so glad i added it to my wardrobe.,5
"I tried this on at antho today and loved it! the pictures online are not doing this garment any favors. it is flattering in person. the fabric is a light fabric-i was a little disappointed in this since i like things to be a little warmer, but this is probably better anyway with spring coming (it is coming, right?-today it's snowing) i like the under-layer that is kind of silky which i think adds a special touch to it. it is versatile and could be paired with anything.",5
Feminine with beading in front. love the neckline and flow. nice fall colors. sleeves button. really nice fit in shoulders. if you like this style it is absolutely beautiful on. may be short on those with long torsos.,5
"I tried this on (in the store) on a whim....then had to have it!! i'm normally a small but really loved the way the medium fit. good thing because it was the last jacket like it in the store!! super soft, comfy...a great purchase!! fur is removable for easy washing or a different look!!!",5
"This is such a great piece. throw this top on with a pair of skinnies and some booties and you're dressed. it walks the line between too tight and too loose beautifully for my figure. love the contrast lining. it washes beautifully (i hang to dry). i wore it twice the first week i owned it. size s was best for me. i'm 5'4, 140lb, 34b, and generally a size 6.",5
"I ordered these jeans on sale based on the great reviews, but when the arrived the color looked different from the online pictures. i don't love the color but decided to try them on anyway since i've never tried ag before. well they are so soft and comfortable and fit great! i didn't want to take them off, so i ended up keeping them. now ag is my favorite brand for jeans!",5
"I'm in love with siyu! i saw this jacket/cape and the brilliant colors drew me in. i had to have it. i'm so glad i purchased it, it is wonderful. i would say that the colors are a bit more muted than in the puctures, but still a brilliant statement piece. i was considering getting the sleeveless golden mock turtleneck to go with it, but glad i didn't. the neck of the jacket comes up fairly high, and it probably wouldn't have shown. the wool material is very fine, not scratchy, and a bit stretchy",5
"I haven't worn a pair of levis in ages, and had forgotten how great they are. i have recently lost weight and i have to say they are very flattering. i wasn't sure at first how i would ilike the frayed hems, but they are growing on me.",5
"This dress is really cute, it's not a complete bag on you. i read that other reviewers complained about the fact that it is see-through. and that is the case, but i own multiple pairs of skin-toned underwear and did not find this to be a problem. the fabric is lightweight, but perfect for the summer. it does wrinkle, but a steamer is your best friend.",5
"I really wanted to love this dress, but i couldn't. it ran large and heavy. rather than a sleek cocktail dress, it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on. there was one upside: the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low, so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture.",1
"This skirt is not only cute but really comfy. i really like the materials it's made of and the way it seems to hug my body in a flattering way. i'm 5'2"" so the only down side is that i wish it came in petite but i still kept it because it looked great hitting me right above my knees and high at my waist. love this skirt!",5
I love this jacket. it's the prettiest and most stylish jean jacket i've ever owned. the sleeves run small. i'm an xs but chose a small so i can button it and wear thin sweaters underneath.,5
"Love this sweater!
soft and cozy and the ruffles are not overwhelming.....just a touch of pretty!
it will look pretty with a turquoise necklace for a pop of color!
classic, comfy and classy!
an anhtro a ++++++++
runs very true to size, ordered my usual size an it fits perfectly.",5
Bought a pair of these with a gift card i got for my birthday.  just ordered another pair!  i love them for everyday use and working out,5
"This dress is adorable. the material is thin and wrinkles easily but it is so flattering. the cut is a little flowy like typical off-the-shoulder dresses but this one is cut in at the waist so your figure is not swallowed up. it combines the sexy summer vibe of an off-the-shoulder look but flatters like a fit and flare dress. it is fairly short. while i am only 5'4"" in an xs it falls just a bit further up on my legs than the model pictured (makes no sense to me). the color is a rich coral pink a",5
"I saw this in the store on a beautiful autumn saturday afternoon and was inspired for what i wanted to add to my wardrobe for the season. this blouse is just fun without being loud or overpowering. the coloration works beautifully with my wardrobe and i can wear this dressed up or dressed down; with skirts, leggings, trousers, jeans...with a vest, jacket, or sweater or on its own. it is substantial enough not to wrinkle and look sloppy, it is easy to launder and will travel well with my capsule",5
"Was really excited for this dress and couldn't be more disappointed. doesn't look anything like the pictures.

the fabric feels...cheap. it came wadded up in a ball and is a wrinkled mess. 

looking beyond that, i tried it on and thought i had put it on incorrectly. unfortunately not. the top half doesn't sit correctly. it's so bizarre that it seems like a flaw in the design. it doesn't sit on your shoulders, but doesn't look right off your shoulders. the neckline is very high. also, front b",1
"These jeans really look very nice on. they are 99% cotton and 1% elastaine. if you want the look that you see on this model, order one size up. i am 5'9""/136 lbs. bought both 27 and 28. decided to keep the 28. mainly because the lower part of the leg was fitting too tight in the 27, looked more like a skinny jean but bunched up at the knee -- they are tapered. (i also own a pair of 100% cotton levi's wedgie in foot hills in size 27 which fit a bit different than these -- the foot hills definitel",5
Quirky tunic length top. has a windowpane print on the inside and the grey plaid looks like flannel but is cotton. the red burgandy embroidery adds punch and it has a boho flair. size down one size runs big.,5
"Love these-although i'm exchanging mine for a size larger. they are definitely wide leg, have plenty of length (i'm 5'6, and there is a good inch of extra length), but i found the waist band to fit snug without a ton of give. i also am working off extra baby weight in the stomach/hip area though, but thought it was worth mentioning. i'm pretty curvey, probably a size 31 in jeans right now, and exchanged a l for a xl. great quality",5
"I really like this denim jacket with the plaid underneath. i also like the removable fur lining being that i live in florida i really don't need that. i ordered a size small which is my normal size and a medium. the small was tight in the arms so, i decided to keep the medium. i am really glad that i followed the others review in regards to sizing.",5
Love this! fits great. warm and soft. would recommend,5
"This suit is perfect in every way! (the leg opening could be a little bigger for the size) i would be a small if the leg openings were a bit bigger.

please please offer another suit before december 2015 so i can buy for our cruise!!!",5
"I saw this a few months back and wanted it then and now i bought it. i missed a few promos but i ended up getting it at full price in a large, my usual size i like in the pilcro denim jacket line. i love pilcro and have several of this brands denim jackets and each one is very special. i love the use of the plaid details. it has a weathered appearance - the denim and my distressed treatments are not too severe, as some reviewers have commented on the ""holes"" . i will say this jacket runs small.",5
I tried this cardigan on today at retailer and i absolutely loved it! it's much cuter in real life than it looks online. it's a perfect sweater for my skinny jeans--long sweater--tall boots winter uniform.,5
"I agree with the other viewers that this cardigan is significantly better looking in person. i am 5'7"" 126 lbs and bought the medium. it is more fitted than how it is on the model. it keeps its shape after multiple wears and is very comfortable. i'm glad i have it!",5
"Denim, faux fur, flannel... hooray! i absolutely love this jacket and i'll wear it all winter (even under my warmer winter coat). i'm 5'6""/130 and usually a 2-4 in retailer and the small in this coat was plenty big in the waist/chest and even had room underneath to add a second shirt or light sweater. it seems a little shorter on me than in the photo... maybe that's the only drawback.",5
Retailerpologists has always carried the best sweatpants. i wish they sold these in more colors. very flattering!,5
"This is a great piece, you can do many things with it. i wore it to work and church :)",5
I love pajama pants by this company. i have a couple now and they are all so soft and lightweight.,5
"I bought these immediately after trying them on. i was totally surprised to see these very cool, edgy pants at retailer. the color and details are spot on! great quality. i wore them with a blaclk leather high platform boot and black top tucked in. i received a lot of compliments. these look like they should come from europe! i just wish retailer would buy better quality and more interesting things like these pants.",5
"This tunic has really cute detail. it is hard to see in online photos, but there is dark brownish beading over the embroidery. the fabric is not as soft as i would have liked, but it's still a keeper because of the two patterns, embroidery and beading. also, it is long and does run large, but i think the measurements given in the description are accurate. it is a tunic after all! i ordered an xs petite, and it will be very cute with leggings and boots.",5
"I am a teacher and love finding cute, comfortable clothes. i wore this for the first time today and got compliments all day long! i felt so stylish, and i was still able to do what i needed to do!",5
"I have gotten so many compliments on this top. it does run very large- i'm normally a large, returned for a medium, which is still a bit on the large size. the small was even still large but much shorter so i loved it so much i just took the medium. it's a 'tent' style or 'trapeze' style which doesn't completely show in the images. super nice, thin linen-like cotton and absolutely beautiful. love it!",5
"This top is fun to wear & looks great with black, grey or my wine color jeans!! love it!",5
I went into the store to try this one on bc of my broad shoulders and muscular build (in arms) as sometimes the open shoulder pieces fit snug. this dress was perfect and so soft!!! fit me like a glove! i have a long torso and am 5'8'' so it's a little short - but throw on some tights and booties and it's perfect! i'm a size 10/12 and got a large :),5
Oh my gosh do i love this jumpsuit. i am so glad that i bought it. it is beautiful and fits perfectly. classy and beautiful and made in the perfect color. the design is slimming as well.there is nothing that i would change about it. i may be wearing this for my 60th birthday this month and am sure i will be getting it out for other occasions in the future. i love it.,5
It is a shame when a product such as this is left on the website after so many comments reveal the item to be more defective in production than an opinion of size proportion. i read the reviews so had expected the item to run small so i ordered accordingly...this does not run small-this is not representative of any of the three categories one associates with women's apparel sizing. i am usually a small and the description by previous reviewers described the fit as being perfect for me-very small,1
"I""m going to a wedding in dec and looking for something different.. thats where my retailer comes in...their is this beautiful lace jumpsuit staring me in the face saying im what u r looking for! i'm 5'4 117 and the petite size 6 fit perfect!! love the navy blue color!. all set,i am ready!!",5
"I was specifically looking for a nice pair of high-waisted jeans and this pair fit the bill. i am a little unsure about the unfinished hem hence the 4 rating on design, i would have preferred a finished hem. i am 5'4"" and they are a tad shorter than i normally like to wear my jeans. i have had them for a couple of days, still deciding whether to keep them despite the fact that i really love them other than these two issues.",5
"This jumpsuit is absolutely beautiful. it fit like a glove and made me feel incredibly classy and sexy at the same time. i am 5'4"" and ~120lbs and the 4 fit like a glove and right at my ankles and above my elbows, the 6 fit a bit more loose and below my ankles and right at my elbows. it is so different and easy to wear.",5
"This is a beautiful dress. the dress is a lighter blue when compared to the picture, and the fabric is thick but the shape is beautiful. the waist is very fitted but it didn't feel uncomfortable. i didn't think the fabric was itchy as others mentioned. i do think it is a bit short on the front (it is a high low dress), but at 5'4"" that is not a problem for me. it was true to size for me (135 lbs, 34c).",5
"I was very excited to receive this dress because of the cute photo. however, upon arrival i was completely disappointed. the color is much more drab than the photo. the smudged polkadots weren't attractive. there were many little bumps and pulls in the linen. the dress is super heavy. the pleats around the waist did not lay correctly.
and it adds 10 pounds to your hips! super sad! i am sending it back.",1
I ordered this dress on a whim in my normal size 8 and if fits perfectly! i felt so pretty when i put it on. i love the volume of the skirt with the tighter top. it was very flattering to me. the linen thickness was nice but not for summer in florida maybe spring. but its lovely!,5
"Purchased this for new years eve and an early january wedding. can't say enough good things about it! the lace fabric is soft with the perfect weight. the style is slimming and flattering. although i am short, i have a full bustline and ordered regular rather than petite and it fits perfectly. pants are very easy to hem if needed.
needs very little by way of accessories because the lace edging is so beautiful.4 seasons appropriate!",5
These tailored front flowy back tops don't always work. this is long enough to wear with leggings and quite flattering,5
"I ordered this after falling in love with the near-identically-patterned red linen shirtdress - this dress has almost exactly the same construction, but the cloth is slightly heavier-weight, and there is no slip (because the fabric is thick enough to not need one). a few other reviewers mentioned that the cut was ill-fitting or unflattering - obviously, that depends on the wearer's build - this dress seems cut for relatively small-busted people, so i lucked out. i love the classic a-frame outlin",5
"It's a cozy sweater that doesn't make me feel frumpy, still stylish and it's not too heavy but still warm enough. it's like wearing a blanket sort of. definitely sheer with the big loom, wear a camisole under it. i got compliments the first day i wore it!",5
"I bought this sweater on a whim in the store, without trying it on. when i got home, i decided it would probably lose it's shape and it seemed a big clunky sweater and i planned to return it. a few days later, desperate for something to wear, i grabbed it and decided to keep it - merely to have something to wear that day. i'm so glad i did.

this is a great sweater. layered with a cami, it looks fantastic it does not lose its shape or grow. it is structured, so it doesn't feel sloppy. it has w",5
"Love the design! fabric is very light and flowy. i like a tank underneath for a little extra coverage. runs a little wide. size down. such a fun top, i've had tons of compliments! i usually wear a size 8 and i purchased a medium but wish that i had sized down to a small.",5
"Every time i turned around received another complement! it was perfect for a december wedding, great for a holiday party, and fit the bill for christmas eve. very comfortable and slimming. i'm still amazed at the number of complements received! the navy blue lace is elegant and comfortable, not scratchy like some lace. the ""v"" in back of the jumpsuit makes it easy to zip and unzip, i have some some imitations and thought i might have a problem zipping up the jumpsuit. not a problem! absolutely a",5
"I would never have noticed this from the product shot, it was on the one of a kind rack at my store. the open work that shows off your bralette or a cami is sexy and it has just the right amount of slouch. super comfy. i loved it. bought a medium.",5
"Soft and comfy without being too thick or too warm. flattering cut. quality material and construction. fully opaque, so no show-though. true to size (i'm 5'8"", 140 lbs, my usual size small is perfect). could not improve upon these joggers. love, love, love.",5
"I tried this one with the free ship/20% without much expectation so i was surprised by this nice piece. i am not usually a fan of sheer shirts, but this one manages to be sheer yet not see through! the black color works that magic. the linen makes this a nicer material rather than the usual knit. i am not usually a linen fan as it gives me the itches, but this is soft and light. the back is really beautiful and brighter colors in person. the balance between the front and back lengths does work a",5
"I couldn't wait to try this on because i love the brand holding horses! this dress did not disappoint! although i detest the difficulty with side zippers (why can't they simply return to the back seam?) i was easily able to pull this dress on because it had some give to the fabric. once on, the dress has a very flattering fit over the bust (the wrap over bodice is already secured with a stitch) and through the tummy. i believe these were sized s,m, l so i took my regular medium.
length wise, par",5
"I love jumpsuits in general. however, it is usually either a yay or a nay and this was definitely a yay! i am currently wearing it right now as i write this review! the waistband hits perfectly on me. i am 5'7 and about 160 and i bought the large. super easy to throw on!",5
"I'd been eyeing this dress for a while, wondering if it could work for me. i wound up ordering the sp size when it went on sale. its pretty perfect-i am 5'4' and currently 130 lbs. it fits well, if a touch loose in the waist, but i think if i had purchased the xsp it might be too snug through the bust, as it's fairly fitted there. the neckline comes a little lower than i usually wear, which is part of why i wanted to order the petite size rather than the regular (that and the length), but i can",5
"I ordered this in grey first but didn't care for the black lace ---- so, decided to try the cream/beige/neutral and i just love it. i have areas i am trying to ""cover up"" and this really fits the bill without looking too much like an oversized tunic. the back is the clincher. different and surprising. washes excellently, but i did line dry as i was afraid of shrinkage. if there are any left you won't be sorry and the neutral color looks good on almost everyone!",5
"I have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection - always the perfect fit and quality fabric. i'm on the taller side at 5'7"" and found this to fit perfectly, yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room. awesome!",5
"This dress is just very unattractive. it is quite short-waisted, almost empire and so the pockets hit in an odd place. also it is very long - midi length - and the skirt is very wide. the effect is matronly, not cute at all. size-wise it fit true to size and it is a nice medium weight denim and the construction is good.",1
"I ordered this top on a whim and never in a million years did i expect to love it as much as i did. while it is by no means work appropriate, it is a fun top for a night out. the material is light and flowy and it drapes perfectly over my post baby tummy. i tried it on with jeans, shorts and white pants and it really looked great with all items. wish this came in a few other colors. for reference, i am a 36dd and a size 12, took the large and it looked flowy without being maternity topish.",5
"I admit, i did not intend to buy a jean-dress but the cut - i could not pass it up. classic and vintage dress style. the fringy hem and more conservative length is so fun and makes the strapless top stand out. with a stunning necklace this will be a versatile piece. no doubt.",5
"I am mad for plaid--this dress is my new favorite!! why? i'll tell you!! the picture online does not do it justice, but you must add a belt. the dress is cut lower in the front, but has a great stitch to keep it from gaping open over my d cup chest. the material is soft and breathable. the xsp was perfect for my 5'2"" frame, my typical size.",5
"You know how sometimes you put something on and don't even have to look in the mirror to know you like it? well this is that piece of clothing. i bought a jumpsuit last year at retailer and wore it all the time so i wanted to get a new one this year. i saw this on the website and liked it all the way through when i put it on at the store. comfy, casual, not too young for my 56-year-old self, the right length, and i can comfortably wear a regular bra with it. perfect on all counts.",5
"This shirt is a 10! i've been looking for an off the shoulder top that i can wear a bra with. i almost never spend full price on retailer items but this one is worth every penny. don't hesitate, just buy it!",5
"I ""studied"" this dress for weeks before i finally bought it. i am soooo glad i bought it. much more fabulous than the picture. soft, quality denim that is not too heavy for summer. very fitted on top. love the pockets and the torn hem.",5
"I have been unable to find a jumpsuit that looks good, likely due to my long torso. this is the first one that doesn't make me look like i am a tall five-year-old (easy to dress it up with a statement necklace) and fits perfectly. i am 5'6"", 120 pds, and bought my normal xs. highly recommend, especially with the current extra % off promotion!",5
This sweatshirt is very cute on. it works well with leggings or skinny jeans. it's the perfect thing to wear when you want to be comfortable but still look feminine.,5
"I loved this dress the second i saw it in the catalog and had to have it! i had been looking for a plaid dress for awhile but couldn't find anything that i fell in love with till this one. i love the front of the dress and the asymmetrical details. it's just beautiful. my only complaint would be that the back of the dress is pretty blah. after all the awesome going on in front, i was disappointed in the view from behind, but i still love this dress and will be keeping it and wearing it for a lon",5
"When i saw this dress the model was standing in an outdoor setting and i fell in love with it but then i noticed the model in an indoors photo the dress looked different. as i studied the difference, it was the way the plaid fell on each dress. the one i liked fell more vertically giving it a slimming effect and the others were horizontal giving it a widening effect so, i went to my local retailer to see. they had the one i liked on a dummy. it is tts and the plaid matched perfectly. the front flo",5
"Let's face it, this dress isn't perfect for all body types, but fits mine perfectly. i""m 5'5"" 120(it) lbs. i love the cut and the unfinished bottom feels very causal when need be or a little more refined when needed. the zipper has a long denim piece attached to help with zipping up. the denim is soft and lays nicely. i suppose the fact that i got it on sale does make me love it that much more, but i keep putting it on. with a closet full of clothes and sun dresses in particular, i still keep pu",5
"The torso runs a bit long, but this is otherwise a comfortable, and cute dress.",5
"The dress is well-structured and refined enough to wear with a cardigan to work on casual fridays but fun enough to wear on its own to a summer festival. because of the length, i would suggest wearing with heels, as it hits below the knee. i would suggest a size down, especially if you are smaller-busted.",5
"This is my third dress-the first one was the right size, but the plaid fell on the dress in an awkward way. the second one was a size too small, but this one is perfect! i am wearing it with a belt and loving it!",5
"Walked into the store and the first thing that caught my eye was this dress. great pattern and fabric, a quality, versatile piece. i am a size 4 and purchased an xs petite, seems to run just a tad big.",5
I was looking for a dress to conceal my post baby body but wanted to be able to wear it once i lost the extra weight and this dress does the job! the fit is very flattering and it hangs nicely. great material.,5
"I had my eye on this dress since it fist came out, but hesitated to order due to some of the lower reviews. when i got a chance to try it on - i loved it! i did go up a size. i am 5'5"" so i had it shortened to above the knee, i didn't mind losing the unfinished hem - had the hem match that of the pockets. i am a 34c but the bodice is stable and even if i pull at it, it stays put! so happy to find this, especially on sale! i plan to wear it at our company party which is help on a large charter bo",5
"Because of my body type, i never thought i could wear a romper. i tried this on out of curiosity and am so glad i did. it fits well (i did size up because of my thighs), is comfortable, and an alternative to a dress. the patterned bottom did not accentuate my lower body, which was a worry. i got compliments when i wore this to dinner with a pair of sandals.",5
Dress is awesome and makes you look skinnier.,5
"I'm 5'6"", 125 lbs, wear size 2 or 4 normally, and small or extra small. 34b bra. i tried on size 2 and it fit great. this dress rocks! i live the soft material and side pockets. not a lover of a line skirts, but this one is subtle. i do need a strapless bra, but if you are more endowed than me, you won't need it. the hem is unseamed, leaving it a bit edgy. since the denium is light i can wear ghis dress now and into summer. i live in texas so probabley won't be wearing it after june. covering my",5
"I ordered this online with out previously trying it on and it fit nicely! just love the colors, draping and material. nice and light, good spring or fall dress. i wore it with black flats but it would look great with booties too. very flattering. i received a ton of compliments!",5
"I love jumpsuits but this literally feels like pajamas. it doesn't look like pajamas but it is soft and cozy and isn't too big or too tight anywhere. i am 5'6"" and 130 and i purchased the small and it fits just like the model. the button in the back at the top is a little hard to close but the whole thing comes off and on easy which is such a bonus in a jumpsuit. this is a winner! it can be worn casually or dressed up.",5
"Strapless dresses can be so flattering so when i saw this on retailer i had to order it! this dress did not disappoint. for reference i ordered a size 4 and i am 5'5"", 135 lbs, 34b chest. in the chest area it fits perfectly, while the ribcage area is a little snug, but not uncomfortably so. the pockets are great. the denim quality is great. and i like the frayed bottom of dress. i got compliments straight away on the beauty of the dress from two men. which i thought was quite interesting because i",5
"I ordered this dress in a size 6. for reference i am 5'7"", 145 lbs. i love it! the fit is perfect. unlike other reviews, i was aware the hem was unfinished, and i like the look. the top part does not seem to short. the style, to me is kinda retro. i wore the dress with flip-flops and a large chunky necklace. i received lot's of compliments, it is my favorite dress right now!",5
"These are truly slouchy leggings. i am short (5'3) so they do bunch quite a bit for me but when paired with a long chunky sweater they are perfect! unlike the other review, i felt that they ran a little on the larger side. i am typically an 8/10 and ordered the m/l. they sit nicely on my lower waist and do not sag but the length is long long long. i recommend these for wearing out or around the house.",5
"The beaded shoulders make this a unique tee shirt. it turns an ordinary tee shirt into a more eye-catching one. i bought 2 different colors and love them. i prefer the little boxier fit as it is very flattering. the material is a nice weight, not too thin.",5

"This has a nice vintage cut and soft feel with the metal detailing of a blinded out rock n roll tee. it's perfect with jeans, a leather skirt or even lounge pants. it's a great top to throw in an overnight bag for a weekend away because it's so versatile.",5
I love this shirt! it fits great and looks awesome with shorts or skinny jeans. i love the beads on the shoulders. i liked it so much that i ordered it in 2 colors.,5
"I cannot even tell you how many pairs of white jeans i have tried on in my quest to find white jeans! all brands and all styles and finally i took a chance on these and have found the ones! these are great quality, as true for any ag pants i have ever purchased. they are a crisp white and are not see through and the fit is amazing! i have athletic legs and with my muscular thighs and calves it has been difficult to find a pair of white jeans that didn't hug to tightly and therefore fitting poorl",5
"Bought this as ""transitional"" wear post baby #2 & i love them! will probably end up wearing them all winter long! i love that i'm 6 foot & they still are scrunchy at the bottom which i honestly wasn't expecting.",5
"The simplicity of this t-shirt will go with jeans, shorts, or anything casual. the macrame and bead details give it that extra style. i bought the red and white, and love them both. the red is warm and bright, with pink undertones. despite the boxiness of the fit, it ran true to size for me. i did not think it was too big; its meant to be loose and slouchy rather than fitted.",5
"This top is lovely. it's got a decent length to it, so it can be tucked into nice pants or a skirt. the gold beading design on the shoulders is a little heavy, which can sometimes cause it to slip/sag off the shoulder -- not entirely off, but enough to reveal a bra strap for a kind of off-shoulder look! it's very flattering if you tuck it in, or even if you don't. i got this top in red, and it's lovely --a little more towards than coral side than crimson.",5
"I am a 5'10"" size 4 (or 28 long - i need a 33-34"" inseam) woman. i bought the s/m and they fit perfectly (with all the excess length bunching at my ankles, as designed)! i'm thrilled. i bought the light color. one thing, wear nude underwear and lighter (or just short) socks - these are definitely see-through! however, i only plan to wear these with long tunics and sweaters anyways - something always reaching down to my upper thighs, at least. so comfy and cozy!",5
"I read the other review that said the shirt was boxy, i didn't think it would be a terribly big deal. unfortunately, it is. normally i wear a size s, so i sized down o an xs. the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline, but the shirt is still very box and now super short. unfortunately, this is going back. not a good fit. adorable details but the fit is terrible.",1
This top has glam written all over it. the pleating gives it a delicate look but is not cheaply made or feeling. it lays so beautiful...i would say this runs tts but because i am busty i sized up to give it more of flowy look. because i am busty it also looks like high low blouse. no need for a necklace the flowers and shimmer do all the work for you. i paired it with leather leggins and it was adorable.,5
"I'm 5'5, 145lbs and i'm usually a small/medium depending on the vendor. i bought this shirt in a red, medium and love it. yes, it's boxy and a little big but lays nicely and i think it's meant to be a bit big. i've worn a black cami underneath and the shoulder hangs off a little to the side giving a little extra sexy look to it. this shirt washes well per instructions, didn't shrink or loose it's shape and i've washed it three times now. i've had many compliments on how cute this shirt is, love",5
I just bought this shirt on sale. i'd been eyeing it for a bit and when it went on sale i had to get it. its really cute and comfortable and fits really nicely. it's not too short or boxy and the detail on the sleeves is great.,5
"I usually do not like three quarter sleeve shirts and i do not like tie necks of any sorts. this blouse has both and i love it! i loved it in pictures and, against my two dislikes listed above, i gave it a chance. i am glad i did. the shirt is lined in the body which means the white one is not see through...yey, no need for cami underneath! the lining also adds extra warmth as this is a very thin fabric shirt. the sleeves are loose enough so that the 3/4 length does not restrict me. the tie some",5
"They're great. i saw them featured in one of the marketing emails. they looked comfortable and cute, different with the leg warmer type bottom. i went to the retailer near me, but they didn't have them in store. this was a slight disappointment because i wanted to try them on for sizing purposes. but, i ordered them because they were affordable, in the $30 range, cute, comfortable, and stylish. they also ended up fitting perfectly as well. nice job!",5
"The metal detail @ the shoulders is the perfect touch to an otherwise ordinary tee. 
regarding sizing. i am 5' 4"", 36dd and i usually have to buy l in tops and make alterations. after reading the other reviews i ordered a m & s. because my shoulders are narrow the s fit better. front measurement shoulder to hem is 24"" on both the s and the m. plenty of length for me. i also wasn't looking for a tight fit around the waist and tucking in just the front as shown on the model looks great. i saw thi",5
"Absolutely love these leggings - warm, comfortable - great way to relax after a long day? snuggle up in these...do stretch even longer after a while, but wash and wear again is easy - even wear out of the house...bought in green and love how well they go with sweaters, shirts, etc. -",5
"For the sale price, this is an amazing deal. i tried the white version of this shirt on in a size 10 because, being on sale, that was all they had available in the store. it was unfortunately too large with the 'v' of the shirt plunging rather low and the sleeves hanging off my shoulders, and i didn't buy it. when i came back a few days later, i found this in a size 6 in black. i honestly don't know my shirt size in numbers, but i'd consider this one a small to medium so i'd say it's fairly true",5
"I slightly balked at the cost, but i am completely satisfied and glowing about the product, and it is made in the usa. in these times, that means a lot. 100% supima cotton and the perfect design with reasonable deep v-neck, front and back and the slightly lengthened sides, very ultimate design for a tee. i bought the dark grey; the tag says ""wash before wearing"", which is one extra step... still, i find this supima cotton tee pretty much divine. i bought the dark grey in medium, my usual ( size",5
"I received this blouse for christmas and it is just gorgeous! it fit true to size, and goes with my whole romantic, feminine style that i have without being overly girly. not too sheer, so no need for a tank underneath, and being that it is neutral, it will go with just about everything i own! love it!",5
"I saw this dress online and thought it looked just ok. i happened to see the dress in my retailer store today, and thought i would try it. i'm so glad i did. this dress looks so much better on. i'm usually a 10-12 in dresses at retailer, i tried this in a large. it fit perfect. it's doesn't cling to you, but it doesn't hang like a sack either. i think it made me look taller and thin. woohoo. i would say it's a little on the thinner side, it's not a heavy knit. it's two layers of thinner knit , as yo",5
"Wearing this dress for the first time now, and i love it! soft material, comfortable, and easy to dress up or dress down, making it good for all kinds of different occasions.

i was a bit nervous about the initial purchase due to other reviews saying this dress isn't great for pear shapes, but i whole-heartedly disagree! i think it actually just needs a belt for those of us with particularly curvy figures - i'm wearing a belt around my natural waist, and have bloused out the top and it looks g",5
"Such a cute skirt! the fabric is comfortable and light, and the the tie in the front helps conceal some of those ""tummy issues"" a lot of people want to hide. :)",5
"I had bee struggling to find a romper with longer length shorts, it seems like so many of the rompers have short shorts for the bottom half and i wanted something to hit upper mid leg, something like a 4"" inseam on a short. on a whim i ordered this and hoped it would be long enough and sure enough it is perfect. still stylish and still ""short"" for summer without it being so short on the bottom. well made! nice closure at bust so there is no gaping.",5
"I bought my typical size (xs) and it fits perfectly. it's loose but not overly baggy which is what i was looking for. the material seems very durable. my concern with all white tops is being too thin and see through and that was not the case with this shirt. the front comes right above my crotch and the back covers my cushion. i've only worn it once and that was with some bootcut jeans, booties, simple earrings and a statement necklace. i highly recommend it.",5
"...a little long still, but loved the fit.
flattering on me, i have thighs and these balanced out the thigh effect. color (wash) was also very nice in my opinion. can be wrn with any top, really, i had to make myself return them jsut coz of price, but on my wish list for sure!",5
"I would not have tried this on or ordered it by myself, but my stylist brought it over for me to try (as it was on promotion). well, ok, i get it, i actually liked it on, but the regular size was too big in the arm hole... thinking of it, i should have ordered the xxs... maybe i will.

flattering style, comfrotable fabric, really nice overall...",5
"I love the cut of this shirt! interesting back, and it hangs nicely.....surprisingly flattering! i'm usually a small and needed the xs in this shirt, fyi. very soft, and overall just very pleased with this purchase! i bought it in the denim as well!",5
"I loved this top when i laid eyes on it online, and in person, it did not disappoint. it is a beautiful and unique top. the color is striking and the style is adorable. i can't wait to wear this with some flare jeans and espadrilles.",5
I ordered this dress in oatmeal the minute i saw it online. i'm 5'5 and 115 lbs. and my usual xs fits perfectly. i would say this dress will be the most flattering on a long lean body type. (it will show bumps and bulges.). i will wear it asap with booties and a jacket. and it also looks great with flip flops or sandals for the summer. very happy!,5
This is a great skirt. i am always on the lookout for machine washable clothes that are fun and work appropriate. this skirt is really flattering on my body. the only thing that's a little off is the tie at the front but it's still really stunning on.,5
"I love the style and quality of this skirt. the material is a bit heavier than anticipated, so it works well in cooler months, and the thickness makes it easy to wear a shirt underneath. it fits true to size - my usual 6 is form-fitting without being overly snug or pulled.

i am on the taller side, and the skirt is fairly long - it comes to the bottom of my knee.",5
It was hard for me to pay full price for basic white button-down but i am so glad i did. the high-low and split back detail give the shirt a unique look. it looks cute with jeans and wedges as a dressed down option. i bought this to go with the shoreline skirt and it looked really good together. this is a staple that can be worn multiple times and for many years.,5
"Love this! when i first saw it online, i thought it was a bit pricey for a plain white shirt. but i finally gave in and ordered it! i'm so glad i did! i've worn it twice in one week so it won't be difficult to get my money's worth! it's very soft and fits perfectly. looks great with jeans or dress pants. i like to tuck the front in my pants and leave the back out.",5
"I seriously love this skirt! i bought it for my college graduation and i was complimented by everyone that saw it. not only that, but it is beyond versatile, you can dress it up, make it casual, or make it professional. it is extremely ideal especially for the price. it also is the most comfortable skirt i've ever worn, so that's a plus.",5
Cute and comfortable. has layered design with black underneath which adds dimension and warmth. can wear in multiple seasons with and without jacket.,5
"This tunic is a casual, comfy yet stylish piece that is a great addition to my wardrobe. the only thing i find might be an issue is the thin material. i tried wearing a tank top under it but the material is too thin and the outline of the tank was too noticeable and looked odd. removed the tank and all was good! pairs great with leggings",5
"I love this jacket - can dress it up or dress it down. over a dress, skirt or jeans. very soft and flattering!",5
This tunic is super comfy and will look great with leggings or skinny jeans. i absolutely love the detailing on the sleeves. i am so glad i ordered this item!,5
This color rich pattern will transition nicely into the fall season. it wears well with a bare leg and will look great with opaque tights later in the season. the higher waist and gathering work well on my figure.,5
"This jacket feels like a throw blanket, but has shape and is appropriate to wear both casually or dressed up to make it profession enough to wear to the office. the jacket is bias cut and longer in the back to cover your rear. since it's fleece, the sleeves roll up easily and you can move around in it with ease. it has pockets big enough to carry your phone. i'm 5'7"" 135 with a small chest and i got the jacket in my normal size small and it's loose enough for me to wear layers underneath. if i w",5
This is my first pure+good piece. i am not disappointed. i am 125# and a 34c....ordered the small. fits like a dream. love the moss color. nice long sleeves (i will am picky about sleeves). comfortable fabric. the detail at the cuff is lovely. i can see this versatile piece taking me through the entire year.,5
"Comfy, will be great with a sweater or vest over it.  love the pink color.",5
"Love this blazer! combines a chic, pulled together look with super soft, comfortable material. will be great for the office and the weekend. runs a little big?am typically a large or xl, so i ordered the xl and had to exchange for a large. might have actually been able to size down to a medium, but didn't want to deal with the back and forth again.",5
"Perfect for lunch with the girls, pta, or saturdays with the family. this skirt is a perfect addition to your fall wardrobe.",5
"I am usually a medium, but sized down to a small for a more fitted look. the light pink is slightly sheer, but will look great over leggings and jeans. i love the detail on the sleeve.",5
"Like many clothes, this looks much better on you than on the model; with a little bit of curve, it is not shapeless but very flattering. i wore it out with friends for drinks and they all exclaimed at how elegant it was. the wrist keyhole is a nice touch, and quality is very good. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs.",5
Thanks for the tip to size down. i am typically a m or a l (36d) and i sized down to a s. it is perfectly structured and warm and soft and beautiful. got it on the 40 percent of sale items so the price was right. absolutely a classic. i got the plum color. thanks retailer for another wardrobe staple.,5
"Love these charlies! the side zip is a nice change of pace and the dark grey goes with practically everything i own. fabric is a perfect weight for spring and summer too. i ordered one size up, mainly because i put on a couple pounds this past winter (like usual) and the description said slim fit. i went from a 6 to an 8 and the 8's weren't big at all, so they might run a tad on the small side. side zipper is a little harder to zip near the waistband, but i don't think that can be prevented.",5
Beautiful fall/winter piece! so soft and comfy!! was unsure about it when i saw it online but once i saw it in store and got to try it on and feel it i could not put it down! i felt you could definitely size down!,5
This coat is so beautiful! like others i wouldn't have even considered it online but i tried it on in the store and absolutely fell in love with. it is the softest material ever and is so flattering on.,5
"I've been looking for sometime for a spring/summer jacket to wear on warm days over light clothing. i wanted something feminine and just structured enough to move beyond casual. this fits the ticket! it is a very pale grey and a soft, cozy fabric. i am 5'8"" tall and 118 lbs, and usually wear an xs in many items but a s in jackets due to the shoulders. these shoulders were large on me in the s. the waist was also large, but worth having it altered. if you find this on sale it's a great buy!",5
Love this skirt ! i thought it would be much shorter but when i tried it on it was the perfect length and super cute!! the material is thick but not uncomfortable and very move able!,5
"This is a gorgeous piece of clothing - true to size, simple yet flattering lines, very comfortable. it has such flattering little touches as well, such as the detail work on the sleeves. love it, love it, love it! i just wish it were machine washable!!",5
"I love this top! from the details on the cuffs to the draping at the neck to the light-weight, yet very high-quality material, this top is my new winter-spring transition piece. i'm 5'3"", small chest, and a slight curve in the hips. the arms of this top fit me fine, but because the fabric doesn't stretch, you may find the sleeves too fitted. the length is perfect for hiding the butt without looking like pajamas (about mid-thigh). i've paired it with cuffed jeans and sneakers (like the model is w",5
"I have wanted a fleece jacket for ages (for warmth and practicality), but i'm not the sporty type. this is the perfect alternative! i got it in wine and use it over a cardigan and dress or jeans. it is a lovely color and passes as wool. this is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. highly recommended. btw, it runs quite big. i'm generally a medium to large but the small is perfect on me.",5
"Wow! great find and a true fit. i totally dislike pant shopping and these are a gem.
slimming, flattering and so comfortable, the style is great. great basic summer pant!",5
"So soft, light and warm! will work as an outer layer or fit under a coat. the wine is beautiful, with a subtle two-tone contrast between the outside and slightly brighter inside, even though it's just one layer. relaxed and casual yet will dress up a tee or blouse.

i'm usually m or even l but the m was too droopy at the shoulders so went for the s, which looks less slouchy and more jacket-y on.",5
I loved the mustard colored version of this skirt for summer and was thrilled to see it reissued in darker hues. same comfortable fit and cool textured fabric that doesn't wrinkle. i found the regular sizing to still be above the knee and the wide elastic waistband great for either a cropped top or a belt. will wear often.,5
I love this skirt and was so happy to see it in stores again in a great color for the fall. the fit is great for me because i do not have a flat stomach and the elastic makes it comfortable to wear. the material is a good quality. this skirt adds the perfect pop of color to my closet.,5
"Long, thin, tunic.  perfect over leggings, great for casual day but look pulled together.",5
"I love charlie pants. i've bought a few in the past, and i've never been disappointed with quality, style, or fit. i love the side zip on these and the nice flat front as a result. i wish more pants were side zip- so much more flattering than having that part stick out under fitted shirts. i got these in a 4, my usual size, and while they fit a little more snugly than my other size 4 charlie pants, there is enough stretch that they don't look or feel too tight. i also got these in the regular, r",5
"Such a beautiful, well-made dress! the color of the dress is slightly more pink in person -- a very pale pink. the lining is an off-white color. it fits very well, aside from being a bit long (i'm 5' and ordered the xxs petite). so glad paper crown is making xxs p now!",5
"I just recently purchased this skirt and i love it!
it's cotton with spandex incorporated, so it's soft and not stiff. it hugs your waist and accentuates your butt nicely. the lace up is unique in design, so it can be dressed up with a sparkle blouse or dressed casual in a t-shirt. i'm 5' 1"" in height so the length is very flattering and it zips up in the back. great color cream and excellent quality.",5
Really comfortable dress to wear.  pretty flower design.  good fabric and ribbon details are well placed. thankful it came with a cotton under slip because it's very sheer fabric and i didn't have to think of  what to put underneath.  have worn it twice since it shipped and i'm really happy with my purchase.  online order and shipment was super fast too.,5
Morher jeans are my favourite! they are soft and fit great. make my saggy butt look good! they do stretch with wears but shrink again in the wash. they do shrink quite a bit so don't dry all the way! i recommend mother to all!,5
"I really like this dress. despite the somewhat gathered skirt, it has a clean line and doesn't add a lot of volume around the hips. the blue is a great color. the length is well above the knee but i'm 5'10"". i can see wearing this dress in the fall with leggings or tights and boots.",5
Bought one for myself and one for my mom.  we both love it.  super soft. boxy and oversized but great for layering over a belted tunic.,5
"Tried this on on a whim and so glad i did, it is lovely! i can't wait for next summer now as i'll definitely wear this as a dress with a light cardigan. seems tts (34d and 5'2"", i bought in a small and it fits nicely). a bit pricey for what it is ($68 or $58 would have been more appropriate i think) so try to get it on sale :)",5
"I bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months. it's so soft and cozy, i'm tempted to keep it! i got the xs/s regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist (belly button) and i've got a shorter torso and am 5'4.5"". i got this during the 40% sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price. a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night, more of a cab to curb piece.",5
This dress is great. wear now and into fall with boots and leggings. it seems to have structure with the seams and is nicley flowy.,5
"This dress can be casual, or you can dress it up for going out. i just love this dress!",5
"What s lovely surprise this jacket/cape/poncho is!  first, it is a substantial piece.  heavier than it appears.  it has an almost faux suede feel to it, with a deliciously lush french terry lining.  it looks and feels very rich.  i bought both colors and was glad i did!  i live on the coast and this will be fantastic over a sweater for morning walks along the shore.  i'm a l/xl and the m/l size is a perfect fit!",5
"These are my first pair of mother denim and certainly not the last. they fit true to size. i am a 26 in designer denim such as j brand, paige, ag. i bought these in a size 26 and they fit perfectly. they hug my curves nicely. i am 5'3 so they bunch up just a little bit at the ankles which i can easily have altered, but honestly don't need it. the quality is great - nice denim material with a lot of stretch to it. i love my skinny jeans tight and these were exactly what i was looking for!",5
As the other reviewer stated the dress is not lined and the fabric feels very cheap. i tried the sp as well and felt i could have gone down to the xsp. i like the style and coloring but given the price and lack of quality this is going back.,1
This is a delightfully soft and fluffy sweater. i might have bought it if my store had the petite size. the white was pretty and a good weight (not too light or heavy) and comfortable. it would be fun to layer over various outfits. it did not seem to shed.,5
I just ordered this top and i love it! it is a perfect top for fall days with a cute leather jacket.,5
"I got this online in a sale and couldn't wait to try it on at home! it's so cute, the fabric is a great print and the fit is swingy, which i love. i have a larger bust than waist and i'm 5'8"", 160 lbs. i ordered my normal size 10 and it fit perfectly. i can't wait to wear it with booties this fall!",5
"It has been a long cold winter and spring...but it is going to get hot!
and this is a perfect dress for july.
i tried this on and did not feel the need for a slip or a cami, yes, it is lightweight, no, i would not consider it for work, but when it gets hot in the summer, i feel like this will be a perfect slip on and go dress for days or casual evenings.
i wear a 12, and the medium fit perfectly
i considered ordering the small, since i had some extra space, but again, it is going to get hot,",5
Horrible fit. i do not understand why they but a aline dress with a skin non aline camisole under the dress.,1
"I purchased all the colors of this wonderful tee after receiving the first. it's machine wash and dry, and they've all held up well through multiple washes so far. the neckline and fit is flattering for a larger bust, due to the ribbing, but would be great on a more athletic figure as well. the fabric is soft enough that the 3/4 sleeves don't bug me, like some other tops do. all the colors are great and you'll want more than one! true to size.",5
This is a nice flowy dress that i plan to wear in the fall with long boots. i love how light it feels.,5
Most comfortable and great looking! i got complements from everyone! literally!,5
"This arrived in my store this morning and it is as cute as it appears online!! i'm a curvy gal so i honestly wasn't feeling like this would look good on me. but it is thick and the fabric is sturdy so it lays on me exactly the way it does on the model! the fabric on the blue side almost has a vinyl feel to it...like it would be rainproof! the sherpa layer is super soft and in my opinion, even cuter than the blue side! the trim is all lined with a faux leather and the ties on each side can be adj",5
"This chemise is very pretty in person. when i tried it on, i was surprised to find that it looks more like a sundress than a chemise. the material is kind of thin, but if you wear a nude colored bra underneath it, it won't show. it looked super cute with a denim jacket on. i took my normal size s and it fits perfectly (for reference, i am 5'2"", 34b, 120lbs). i am very happy with this purchase, and i can't wear it as a chemise, a coverup, or a hot day sundress. highly recommended!",5
"I love pj's and other assorted lounging pieces, and this one is exceptional. in fact, i plan to buy the pj bottoms made with the same fabric. i tried them both on in the store, and ultimately decided on the chemise because it is very special.
the fit is tts. fyi: 36c, short waist, broad shoulders, 5'3""
i normally wear a m/l in a chemise, and i chose a m in this one. there is plenty of room, but it is more fitted to my shape as a chemise should be. the piece shows curves, without showing bumps",5
I was waiting for this top to go on sale because its one of those tops that you can probably only find the right weather to wear it once a year. so i was so happy i could order this ahead of time and pick it up in the store the same day!,5
"I bought this dress for fall and will get a lot of wear out of it! the fit is perfect - loose, but structured. plan to pair with booties over the coming months!",5
"Love love love this in the pink! not as big a big of the off-white, but it's nice too.",5
"The saundra tank is a very pretty and feminine knitted top. it is soft and comes in a very delicate pink color.
i took this on a recent trip and it paired well with capri tights and wedges. it was very comfortable to wear having a medium weight to it. the only issue that i had was that the cut below your arms is very deep and made it difficult to hide the side of your bra. it is a rather loose fit, so if you prefer something more form fitting, you might opt for a smaller size.",5
"Nice loose-fitting dress to wear in the summer and to transition into the fall. i had no problem with the slip being too tight. 5'3'', 118lbs, and went with my normal size 2. it was loose through the body but sizing down would have made the dress too tight on my shoulders. it's great with boots or flats!",5
"This is a beautiful dress. however, it looked awful on me. i ordered the medium and it was huge. also, i looked 7 months pregnant. not a good style for the short person.",1
"This is a surprisingly cute faux-fur coverup! it's much cuter in person than on the model. i will be wearing mine over a little black dress, for the holiday parties. it's very glam! perfect for going out. it's also very soft, snuggly, and comfy. most faux fur makes me look gigantic and wide, but this one looks a bit like a little capelet or shrug, and very flattering. it flares out nicely in the back too, and it has a pretty lace-knit stripe pattern on the back. it does shed a bit though. also,",5
This is totally different. great addition to my wardrobe!,5
"I ordered this shirt in the xl in both colors and i am in love! as a large chested lady, with a bit extra around the middle, this shirt is super flattering and perfect for everyday summer weather. i'm sure i will be wearing this all summer. yay retailer!",5
"Luckily i bought this on sale... i now see the instructions online say to hand wash, but i bought mine in the store. the instructions on the tag said to wash delicate in cold water and tumble dry. i washed it in cold water and it shrunk to doll size.",1
"I saw this in the store and loved the feel of the fabric but did not want to pay full price. i was very happy when it went on sale. the top clings nicely without feeling tight. i got sp (5'5, 125)as i worried the neckline would slip off. fits perfectly. fabric has a very slight sheen. i just hope it holds up to washing and caution is needed as you may create pulls with jewelry if careless.",5
"I love this tunic! perfect for the beach or by the pool! gorgeous design and even better in person! light weight, i am usually a small/medium and originally bought the small but ended up returning for the medium so i had a little more room up top for wearing over my swimsuit.",5
Great unique style top for casual or dress,5
"For my 5'9"", 36 c bust, hourglass frame, and 170 lbs, i got the medium and found it fit well. a bit snug but i didn't want to go to large and have it too loose at the top. my thoughts below:
__________
pros:
- lots of stretch and comfortable due to being part modal.
- the pleating on either side on the shoulders just drapes so lovely with the cowlneck. it just gives it an edgy look that i really like.
- this ""grey"" has actually a minuscule houndstooth-like or checkboard-like appearance that's ha",5
"I tried this on even though i usually am not interested in cowlneck tops. the fabric is heavier, so it is not good for hot weather. the fabric is a weave of lighter and darker colors - you can see if you zoom in, so it has an interesting texture. very flattering because it is fitted and not boxy.",5
"Thanks to the previous reviewer who noted the details and size of the blouse, i purchased this blouse. it's true to size, size small fit me perfectly (i'm 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), and it even fit my muscular arms and broad shoulders perfectly. the color is very rich, a wine color. some of the jars of jam have berries on it, and of course, the tassels have spoons at the end. the neckline is so perfect, feminine yet appropriate for work. how cute is that? it is a silky material and flows perfectly",5
"This is an adorable topper for all these ballgowns when you have no top. that said, it was a lot shorter on me than i expected. i attribute this to the fact that i have a chest. the fit is true to size, but while not showing much tightness around the chest to any gape in the buttons in the back, it became more of a crop top. i have been needing a short topper so i'm definitely keeping this. the back button detail is adorable. the lace for me is soft and not stratchy or irritating but i only trie",5
"While there are a countless number of ""winter-white wear-with everything"" sweaters, this is the best one i have seen yet. it is a substantial weight without being coat-like. it is cozy and can be crossed over in front to wrap if desired and it is not itchy as it is cotton. and it's hand washable! i would say it' runs true to size. i wear a 0-2 and petite ( 5 ft 2 in). i purchased the xs but not in petite becasue i wanted the length. it fits fine in the shoulders but the sleeves hit me at my knuc",5
Beautiful blouse - the material is great. long enough to wear over leggings but i've also worn with my flare jeans. somewhat fitted at the top and then drapes out in a gorgeous way. one of my new favorites.,5
The sweater had a square fit it has a chiffon ruffle at the bottom which i didn't see in the picture.,5
Absolutely love this in blue. the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape. the colors and pattern are accurate on screen - vibrant and rich. the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy. very happy with this purchase!,5
"Maeve has done it again with a fabulous blouse. i bought in the blue motif and the colors are so wonderfully fall. the length is great for skinny jeans and leggings. loved that it covered the rear end as well. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame, 34c and the size small fit well.",5
"I bought this in the store so i didn't know that it was actually a sleep chemise. i kind of wondered if it was supposed to be a super-short dress but the salesgirl said that it was a top so i tried it on. the price is shocking but i'm a teacher and this month (july) teachers get 15% off so that helped a little bit. when i tried it on, i absolutely loved it. maybe i look like a cupcake but i'm a very happy cupcake with tassels dangling from my sleeves! who doesn't love tassels?! this is just a ve",5
"I rarely write reviews, but this one deserves one. this top is completely, utterly, adorable! it flows so beautifully, which makes it perfect to wear with leggings/skinny jeans. i wore mine with a blazer for a work holiday party, and i received so many compliments. this top makes you feel so feminine and pretty. i love the maeve brand, and this is certainly no exception! i'd love to get it in multiple colors!",5
"This dress is gorgeous. i took the advice of a previous reviewer and tried one size down, it fit perfectly. i am usually between a 10 or 8 in retailer dresses depending on the cut, the size 8 in this was great. i am near the small chested side a 36b and there was still plenty of room in the top. the swimmers on the dress are embroidered and i didn't really notice until i saw the inside. beautiful detail. the dress is a lightweight cotton and great for warm weather. its even more flattering to be a",5
"The shape is flattering on my postpartum body. even though the material is stretchy cotton and the shirt fits well across my shoulders and chest, the swing shape hides my stomach area. the material doesn't seem particularly breathable, so you might want to avoid wearing it in really hot, humid weather; but for my summers in the pacific northwest, it'll be fine.",5
I adore this blouse. i bought it in the blue at my local store and ordered the white! so cute. be careful- i dried my blue one (i openly did not read the care instructions..haha) and it shrunk a little. still beautiful though!,5
"I bought this dress as soon as i received the retailer catalogue. i rushed to the store because i absolutely fell in love with it. when i tried it on, i went a complete size down. i'm usually an 8, but i snagged this beauty in a 6. the top part really does run larger, so unless you have really broad shoulders, you'll need to size down. the sleeves hit my arms at a nice place, and the little tie in the front is awesome, because not only is it an interesting detail, it can be loosened or tightened d",5
"This blouse combines two things i love - swing tops and bows. just received this and am very pleased. the blue version is very pretty. i recently purchased another top by the same brand and ordered a 6. for this, i ordered a small and am glad i did. i would suggest ordering your regular size (the top is fitted, the bottom is very fluid).",5
This is a great top. easy breezy and perfect for fall in miami. perfect top for spring too. love the whimsical pattern. a great addition to any wardrobe.,5
Really cute fun print. nice summer dress..,5
"Totally bummed. the pretty print doesn't outweigh the very odd fit of this dress. makes you look really top heavy and even the print, which looks so cute online, looks muddled in person. sadly, went right back.",1
"I love this sweater. i found it in the sale section a few weeks ago but wasn't sure if it would be too bulky. it had a dark smudge on the collar left from someone or something. i thought maybe it had been left behind by others for that reason because the quality was so nice. thankfully, i washed it and the smudge came out. 


i live in houston, tx and don't need to wear wool or cashmere sweaters for warmth. this is mostly cotton. it is well made. the sleeves were longer on me than the model,",5
I really wanted to love this piece but it was very large. i'm 5'2 and ordered xs/s and i have return due to size.,1
I have gotten so many compliments on this blouse! material is very comfortable and the fit is great!,5
Love everything about the top. it's very versatile wear by itself or with a cute jacket. it's a great staple to have in your closet.,5
"This dress is the opitome of summer! day or night, running errands during the day to a casual night out this dress will be that go to favorite. i feel it runs small on the top, i am large busted and i sized up for this reason and it still could be roomier...i wear a size 10 on top and for referance i got the 12. i will keep it as it is not uncomfortable but for a drees that lends to a drape on top i wish they would have made it roomier....imhave never had this issue with mauve as it is one of my",5
"I love the print on this. love. and the fit, for a swing blouse, was super flattering! typically i haven't found that to be true, but this one is so nice! i loved it so much, but i just couldn't find a ton of outfits to wear with such a unique piece. i have been trying to slim my closet so i did return this, but perhaps would purchase it on sale (to justify wearing it less). i typically wear a 4 in tops and dresses and took an xs.",5
"This top is absolutely gorgeous!! i ordered in xs and unfortunately could not button it, too tight. for reference i am 5-3"", 120 lbs, 34b. i will definately be exchanging it for a size s, i just love how classy and glamorous this top is. i do wish it were a few inches longer, but it still looks so nice. i agree with other reviewer how nice it will go over a cocktail dress. hoping the size s has a better fit on me!",5
I love this! very comfortable & cute dress. true to size & picture. can't wait to wear it!,5
"What a fun print to have on a dress, let alone a sweet off white lace confection like this one. i really love the design and all the nice high quality touches. because i am busty and there is no stretch, i sized up. my only wish was that the look of the skirt wasn't so innocent..the flounce looks a bit juvenile, especially at my age. i'll try to figure out how to flatten it , maybe wet the skirts like a regency lady ;) here are my stats since i purchased 12p: 5'3"" 145# 36dd.",5
"Ig and the first reviewer convinced me to buy this top. it was styled so beautifully with jeans and shorts on two different retailer associates, i wanted to see if i could pull it off too. unfortunately my body type and shortness makes the it look like i'm wearing short peasant skirt as a top.  really disappointed since the top is soft, beautiful, vibrant silk! maybe i will keep since i'm losing weight and will try it on again. generally i wear size m/l and i'm 5'3"" 135# 38-28-35. purchased this c",5
"I really liked this dress online and i loved it in person. the print is different, the waist is synched, skirt is full. has a very feminine shape. definitely a special piece. runs large. i'm usually a 6 in dresses and an 8 in skirts. i'm 5-5"" 136#s, 34c and then 6 was noticeably too big. size 4 fit perfect (and i'm no size 4). no sleeves will make if easy to add a denim jacket or a cardigan. it hits approx 3-4"" above the knees, but has a conservative high neckline and back is covered. good quali",5
"The fabric of this dress is warm, soft, and comfortable. it is versatile and can be worn at both work or out for a casual evening date. it is cute without a belt but, i prefer one just to give it more shape. i plan to wear it often this season. i am 34b/28/37 and purchased a size small.",5
"I love this top!!! it is soft, flattering, and beautifully cut/designed. i get so many compliments every time i wear it. i have the blue and the green, and wish they had the white in my size. beautifully elegant and can be dressed up or down. best purchase i ever made at retailer!!!",5
I love this dress. the pattern is super cute and looks great with a jean jacket and comfy sandals or white sneakers. tons of compliments!!,5
"I am so crazy about this dress. i got it in the mail today and just love it!  no, it's not lined but it's not see through so no big deal. i was afraid the tie would add bulk but i look very thin. i just need to call for a price adjustment since i payed full price!",5
"I am 5'0"", 109lbs, and the 00 petite fit perfectly. the length was great too. as one reader noted, the zipper can be a little tricky  but dont let that deter you from getting a pair of these sweet duds. it stretchs out a little as the day goes by but that is bearable.  it has a hint of pink to it too. can be dressed up for the office or dressed down.",5
Love this chinos.  they fit tts and the blue is vibrant.  bought them in pink too.  for reference i am 5&amp;amp;amp;#39;5&amp;amp;amp;quot; and weigh 122 lbs and bought size 27.  the fit is a bit slouchy much like in the photos.,5
"I was fortunate to order the perfect size the first time. i am 5'3"" and 125 and ordered the size 4. it is a great fit. these lightweight pants are super cute and i especially love the way they are cut to dip a bit lower (not asymmetrical, just talking about the drape) on the inside hem so outside hem is perky and the bottom looks wide and is flattering. these zip up the back and the back lays flat which is also flattering. i love the look of the fabric so if i have a complaint it's that for the",5
"This dress is so soft, and fits like a dream. i'm a new mom and the tie perfectly masks what's left of my mummy tummy, while still helping me feel stylish for fall!",5
"Loved these in the store but the 00 was sold out everywhere and i noticed the fabric was very stretchy. i bought the 0 petite online and was worried about the length. they fit great. i'm 5'5"" .",5
"Perfect. easy , effortlessly beautiful design and just my favorite pajama ever. i'm not my ideal weight right now and these make me feel attractive again.love!",5
"This is different from any bra i've had before, in a good way. the lace over the front is really beautiful, and no annoying straps means it's comfortable! fit and support are both great. i didn't notice that it was silk when i ordered, so it was a nice surprise to open something so luxe and elegant. i wasn't expecting an underwire, either, based on the s-m-l sizing, but it has one.",5
"I ordered the sapphire.............it is simply beautiful!
love love love.
superior hunter style and quality which never disappoints!",5
"I like the color and design of the pullover sweater, so i bought it as a christmas gift for myself. it arrives almost the same as the picture. the only complain i have is that the size is a little larger than i expected. however it still look good on me,",5
Love this dress! it can be worn in cold or warm weather with tights and boots or sandals and bare legs. the fit is roomy and a little longer in back. it washes nicely without losing length.,5
"I have never purchased printed pants before, but i was so smitten with the cute little shells that i had to try them on. i was impressed with the fabric, which has some thickness to it but will still be perfect for summer. i also have athletic calves and unlike other cartonnier pants i've tried, i had no trouble getting these over my legs! win win! i'm usually a size 8 and while it was fitted (not loose like on the model) i know they will stretch. being 5'4'' i'm just on the boarder of having mo",5
"I am 5'5 about 110 lbs and the size 0 regular fits me well. sometimes i order petite, but the regular fit me just right. they are higher waisted than most pants i wear, but they are completely adorable and comfortable to boot. love the pattern. the sturdy quality is tangible. definitely going to order more of these pants in different patterns as they become available.",5
I love this dress which for me will double as tunic over leggings/tights. the fabric is very comfortable for fall into winter for southern california and looks super cute with booties or boots. this will be a mainstay of my wardrobe.,5
"I love this dress. it is exactly my style, which is probably why i love it: girly, frilly, flowy... i love how much material it has. it flows and twirls in such a nice way because of the amount of fabric. it's the right length that the amount of material is not overwhelming - i'm 5'5"" and it hits just above my knees. i am currently 6 months pregnant, and it's plenty roomy to fit now, and will also mask the post-baby belly this summer. the only 2 cons, and the other reviewers touched on these as",5
"Great style and the color, can be dressed up or down. i love it!",5
Wish i would have bought them in every color. love,5
"I wore these with high heels to a formal gathering. i received many compliments. perfect for summer. you can dress them up with heels, or wear flats or sandals and be casual. i have a pear shape, so i think they fit best for my body type. love them!",5
"Love these pants. it's hard to get really dark dark black jeans with a little stretch, and these are perfect. i also like the cut as a bit of a change from skin tight leggings. and the fabric is super cool, like a lightweight brocade denim. i get compliments every time i wear them.",5
I love these pants! they fit perfectly and are great for casual days at work. great quality too! love!!!,5
"Lovely sweater, good quality fabric, pretty color. 
as the reviewer say, it is very thick wool pile, if warm is not what you're looking for, you may want to think twice.",5
"This 1960s aprã¨s-ski style sweater is made of an amazingly soft pure wool in a color that is a touch brighter and maybe even a bit more coral pink than the online photo looks to me. there is a large button under the collar that shows if you stand it up. seems to be of a very high quality, comparable to vintage hand-knit sweaters.
.
it is very chunky and warm, and i would recommend taking a size up for a looser fit. i'm 5'2"", 33-25-37, narrow shoulders, and otth the xs and s fit me well, running",5
"This simple dress will turn heads. it fits to the body, hugging just in the right spots. i love this dress! it is soft and feels amazing on. you can adjust the tie in the front. i purchased the copper color, but i have to say that is much more brown to me than copper. a dark brown. i still think the dress is adorable. looks cute with booties or knee high boots. winner!",5
I have been searching for these pants my whole life. i have them in several colors. i wear the moss most often. i'd recommend your normal size or size down if in between sizes. they stretch a bit as you wear them. one other thing- after being washed and dried the color has lightened significantly.,5
"I love this kimono, it's so soft, very beautiful and delicate. so flowy just like picture... gives your outfit such a beautiful addition!",5
"I was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays. love the style and the fit. my only disappointment was that they don't have as much stretch as i thought they would (i wrote above that it ""runs small"" but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok). for reference i'm 5'5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter. i would exchange for a 26 but they're sold out unfortunately!",5
This is a gorgeous jacket! love the softness and the style is unique and fresh. the color is going to keep me cheered through the winter. this will look great with a scarf and leggings.,5
"The photos shown here really do not do this bomber jacket justice! the colors of the embroidery are much deeper and richer in person! it is very well made, having no loose threads whatsoever. the retailer store where i bought mine featured this jacket over an ivory color lace blouse and it looked much more stunning than over the darker color that they show it here with. it does run true to size as the other reviewer mentioned too. i took my usual size large. i would say that if you're betwe",5
I bought this to wear with a skirt that i wanted to dress down - i needed something that was long enough to be able to tuck it in without having that awkward line. its a great fit.,5
I love this flattering and comfortable jacket- it has a nice stretch and the color is out of this world. i think it will pack a big punch this fall.,5
"I stopped into retailer the other day for some ""window"" shopping and as soon as i saw this cardigan, it was love and i had to try it on. the sleeves run long on me but i'm on the shorter side so it was to be expected. everything else about this cardigan is amazing. i ran errands yesterday and it was the perfect weight for our cooler autumn weather. love this cardigan.",5
"Oh my. so soft, so delicious, i love this sweater.

absolutely my new favorite. buy this. you won't be disappointed. the neck is soft and not irritating at all like the other reviewer said.
love love.
look how big the hood is if you so want.",5
"I ordered the black and white, and the pattern is just as pictured (so cute!), but after reading the other reviews, i ordered a size up. and i'm glad i did. the m would have been snug, but the skirt in the l fit me as pictured on the model. i am i b cup, and the top was snug but not unflatteringly so on me. it's still a dress i can wear to work and even wear a tank underneath if i wanted to. overall, i'm incredibly happy with this one; i'm fairly straight, though, so i can see how this might be",5
"Thanks to the vertical stripes, the adjustable neckline, the bow that cinches the waist, and the free flowing skirt, this dress is extremely flattering. the compliments i received when wearing this dress back that up! i was unsure if i should order a medium or large because i typically wear either/or depending on the dress style due to my hips. i ordered a large which fit thanks to the adjustable neckline and adjustable waist, but a medium definitely would have worked just as well for me (i just",5
"Tried it on in store and had to have it. so soft and easy to throw on. i'm 5'6"" and it hits at the knee. i usually wear an xs or small in tops and the xs fit great.",5
"I just love sleeping on snow sweaters and this one is no exception. it's soft and cozy and very warm. i do have sensitive skin, so i found this a bit itchy right away, but that went away after i wore it for a bit. this is oversized, but in a great way. you could size down if you wanted something a bit more fitted. sleeves are long and pre-cuffed. sweater hit me mid-lower thigh.",5
Worth every penny. i sized down one size and they look amazing.,5
"I never would have thought that i could wear a jumpsuit and it actually look good on me, but this is it!!! the fabric is weighted some so it lays very flattering and is very comfortable. the sash can be tied several ways-front, back, or side. i will be traveling in this to the beach and pairing it with an retailer wrap, and then wearing it alone with sandals once we exit the freezing airplanes. a racer back bra works great with this piece and the pockets are an added bonus. it looks like a d",5
"I love this jacket. let's be clear though...it's not for warmth just for style but it's perfect for fall in california. i love the detailed work and have already tried this with so many different layers, a light blue tank, off white shirt, tshirt and it looks great with lots of things and truly makes the outfit. love unique pieces like this and i will be wearing it often. i bought my usual size small. sleeves are a bit long for my 5'4 frame but they didn't have in petite and it looks great.",5
This was a return in my sale room and i just decided to try it on. love it! fits true to size thought kind of hard to zip up all the way. colors are great. got the petite size. the pattern is different for each one so each is unique. mine has. lot more navy blue.,5
"I like the light fabric and embroidery on a otherwise hard look (bomber). feminine can be worn casually with jeans and a t-shirt, or over a dress. lovely on every note. fit: i ordered botih the xxs p and xsp. (had tried on regular xs in store) tried on the xxsp first and kept it (didn't try on xs p). since the fit is loose (bomber) on me i like it a little more fitted. there is enough room for a sweater. 

i am 115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist. arms were not too snug either...",5
"I tried this one as a xs and xs petite, and of course ,the petite is the way to go for me. length slightly below around the knee, if i pull on the straps, then the hem hits the knees. i wish the blue was still available in petite, now that it is on sale. the waist is adjustable,and so are the straps. the material is airy like linen. pretty and flirty, and appropriate for work, can't go wrong.

(115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist)",5
"This dress is very well-made, fully-lined, and overall quite beautiful. however, i will have to agree with the other reviewers who say that it runs small. i am typically a solid medium in retailer clothes (5'9"", 36b, 155 lbs., apple shaped, long torso), but the medium in this is skin. tight. not a good look. the large fit much better and i did not find the skirt to be like a pencil (the fit is like the picture) and the length is at the knee. anyway, interesting that there is a such a huge differen",5
"This sweater is super soft and comfortable. runs very big. i usually wear a large, i purchased a medium and it is almost too big.",5
Love classical look and this dress may look great on not so much curvy shape. price is great with extra 40% off so considering to get dark red one as well now!,5
"Wow i have never owned a pair of pants that fit so well! this is my first pair of pants from retailer. i always have the ""too tight in the thighs"" and ""gaping at the waist"" issue but not with these at all. i was so surprised. i purchases size 26 in both tan and blue. the perfect amount of stretch and so comfortable. a bit long but flares look best with heals anyway;)",5
This dress fits comfortably with great fabric and feels sturdy without to much weight. i love the color. the fit would be flattering on many different body types. i would highly reccomend this dress.,5
"I bought these in light grey and navy. they are both beautiful. high quality,very flattering, and so comfortable! i love them! they're a perfect long length. i have long legs and it can be challenging finding a good length in pants. the pockets are deep and functional, which is rare in women's pants. they are more than i like to spend, but i will get a lot of wear out of them. they look and feel fantastic. i highly recommend these!",5
So glad i was able to snag these killer 70's-ish flares. they are super cool at a nice length. love the button detail. i ordered these in my current size and they fit right out of the box. love them so much.,5
"It jacket of the season! this bomber is absolutely perfect. not only is the embroidery beautiful, but it's super comfy as well. it's lightweight, nicely lined, and well made. i only gave it four stars for quality simply because the embroidery could get pulled and frayed if not careful. you should expect that with any silky embroidered fabric however.  i would highly recommend this jacket for any body type.",5
"Love the fit of this dress! i'm 5'2"" 120 and the petite extra small fits perfectly. the waist is slimming and the cut is not too low. also great pattern.",5
This is a beautiful dress. fits true to size. very flowy and comfortable. the color looks just like the pic.,5
"This is my first pair of pilcro pants but defiantly not my last. i always have a hard time trying to decide between a regular length and a tall because at 5'10"" i usually fall somewhere in between. i ordered the regular length and couldn't b happier, they are just long enough to wear a shorter heal with or a pair of flats. the beige color is really nice and pairs nicely with the sky blue mock turtleneck sweater i also ordered from retailer. i love the retro 70's style too! i couldn't be happier wi",5
"Dressed up or dressed down, this summer dress is perfect. the skirt is a lot of fabric, like others have said, but it's part of what makes this dress fun; and because the top is fitted, i find it very flattering because you can adjust the tie around the waist to make it fitted. that being said, the design sort of threw me off when it arrived in the mail because the waist as well as straps around the shoulders are adjustable; at first it looked like a sack, but when it's on and adjusted it will l",5
"This dress intrigued me a bit online, but not enough to order it to try it. even on the rack, i wasn't so sure about it, but decided to try it this afternoon. i couldn't have been more pleased. it is fresh, flattering, flowy, light and beautiful. even though there is quite a bit of fabric, the vertical stripes and nipped in waist make it extremely flattering. i didn't realize this came in blue as well. i may add that one to my wishlist, but the red one is a definite winner. it will make a great",5

"The images definitely do not do the jacket justice. the detail is beautiful, and the fabric is unexpected and quite luxurious.",5
"This is soft to the touch and just beautiful.
it is a little roomy, but true to size. i love it that way. 
totally on trend for the season",5
"I tried this on in the store and thought the flowy fit and asymmetrical hem were great. the fabric is thin, which is nice for summer, but lined at the top half so it's not transparent except below the knee. the waist is quite high and has flexible elastic for an easy fit. i liked the skirt a lot and came online to find it in petite. sadly, it is sold out of most sizes in the petite length. i wish antrho would order more of the petite sizes because they seem to sell out fast!",5
"This is one of those rare garments that is actually as flattering on me as it looks on the model. just like the picture, it hangs like a dress and emphasizes my curves without seeming too revealing. the weight of the fabric creates graceful movement, while the loose cut keeps it cool and breezy. for reference, i am 5'4"" and curvy (34d, 35x28x39), and i ordered a small petite. this is a smaller size than i would wear in most styles, but it fits almost like it was made for me. the tie hits slightl",5
Love how this fits. length is great so i didn't need to hem (you wouldn't be able to). flattering on muscular/athletic legs/bottom. i bought in navy and then had to buy it in another color it fit so well.,5
"This lovely number met all my expectations. ordered an xl, and glad i did. the fabric and styling has flattering drape and it can be dressed up or worn for a casual night out. if it was available in another classic color, or a subtle neutral pattern i'd probably purchase a second one (hint hint retailer).",5
I was a little hesitant about sizing based on reviews-but my normal small fit perfectly. it is a little low cut for work-but with a scarf will be fine. i wish it was a bit shorter (hits just below the knees on me).but overall great. i have a fairly straight body type and think dress probably works best on this type. although if you were small on top and curvy on bottom i think this could be cute too. for the price point (with the sale) its definitely worth trying! i got the black and white-and i,5
"You can?t go wrong with this one. it?s is super flattering. the size medium fit perfectly. for reference, i have a 38in chest (32 ff) and in the medium i was not over exposed, and it can be worn with a racing back bra with it not showing. i wish it came i more colors. please retailer?make this one in more colors.",5
I'm not a big fan of rompers but love this one. it is very flattering and comfortable. i love that you can dress it up with some heels and accessorizes or more casual with flats.,5
"This is a lovely, romantic skirt that hangs nicely. it is lined except for the ruffle on the bottom. as others have said, the waistband is stretchy and molds to your shape. it is high waisted. i called the store to hold a size 4 and 6 for me to try. when i got there, i finally settled on a size 2, so it runs a bit large. i have a 25 inch waist and 36 inch hips. if this fits your style, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",5
The dress is true to fit and very soft. you can dress it up or be casual with a denim jacket.,5

"I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. the dress falls just below my knees, perfect for the colder weather! i bought this in m in two colors because i love it so much! the fit is so flattering and the material is so soft and comfortable. i continue to find maeve dresses classic, quality, flattering and comfortable!",5
"I bought this jacket in a regular and returned it to the store where they had a petite, it is lovely.  i live in ca so it is perfect for an evening out.... remember not to buy this for warmth but a light cover up.  it makes an outfit out of anything else you might want to wear.  looks great with black under it or off white.... also looks great with the beautiful soft pinks that are out this season... or cranberry.... you will love it...",5
Absolutely love this cardi! it's perfect with nice jeans and boots or my black pants. i am nearly 6' tall and a medium is plenty long in the sleeve and overall length. it adds warmth but it's breathable so it doesn't give you the super hot effect when going inside. they only reason i gave a 4 in quality is that it is loosely stitched so you can get caught on things :) otherwise it is a great addition to my closet!,5
This fit me perfectly with a little room but think it's meant to be this way so easier to get on and off. this feels like a dream and is very good quality. definitely a heavier piece but i like that. it is so very flattering and drapes beautifully to hide my tummy. the back is adorable too! retailer hit it out of park with this one! grab it before it's too late! i'm a 36ddd and size 14 and the large fit perfectly,5
"I bought this sweater/coat as a gift for my mother. she absolutely loves.it. it does seem to run a little large, and the sleeves are especially long. the navy and grey color combo is very nice. it seems like it will be very warm too.",5
"I love this dress. i've received compliments from everyone. it's long enough to feel appropriate for work or teaching in sunday school - and, it's beautiful!",5
I saw this on one of the gals at my local retailer and fell in love. it is the coolest bomber and i instantly fell for it. i went with my normal l and i will be wearing this all fall and winter long it's just so unique and eye catching,5
"I saw this online and went to the store yesterday to find it. i tried on a m, which is my normal size, and a s, which, if clothes are baggy, i'll buy for a more fitted look. the s was too small in the shoulders and my arm movement was restricted, so i bought the m. this is definitely true to size. it has a blousy waist to it, so no amount of downsizing will make this a fitted jacket. notice the model is pushing the jacket down with her hands in the pockets to make it look like it has a more defi",5
"My favorite of the season. i purchased the grey sweater while shopping with girlfriends. i love it so much i'll be purchasing the brown as well. i would normally wear a m/l but tried it on and purchased a s. i don't like very fitted items. however, a small fit perfectly on me. this item runs big.",5
"I bought this on sale in all 3 colors. it doesn't look like much in the photos, but that's really the point. this is a staple, basic piece. layer on colors and prints, like a printed jacket, scarf or bag. i bought this in wine, along with the sweater knit boots and a bag with a print that ties the colors together. the shape of this dress is great - fitted through the waist and not a lot of extra fabric in the skirt. midi is usually a bad length for me 5'2"" but since the skirt isn't overwhelming,",5
"This dress is easy to dress up or down, and is very comfortable.",5
"You know when you're shopping and you don't buy something you like, but later you can't stop thinking about it? that was the case with his sweater! i saw it paired with a cute top in the store so i tried it on on a whim. i'm so glad i eventually got it! it's toasty, soft, and thick with the perfect amount of quirk.",5
"This is the perfect warm cozy boho sweater. the blue trim really stands out and brightens up the grey. this sweater will look cute over any outfit, or with jeans. i have long arms, and the sleeves almost cover my hands, which i really like. i highly recommend this, especially at 20% off!",5
"I just bought this skirt in the store and i'm happy with it, it can be dressed up or down it is made of washable silk so it doesn't require dry cleaning (but it should be hand washed or on delicate cycle obviously). it fits through the hips without being overly clingy. the waist is a wide stretchy smocking style so there is some give.",5
"This jacket is a show stopper.  great fabric, beautiful embroidery.  well worth the price.",5
"I love this! it is comfortable, flowing and reminds me of glamorous women in 1970's movies. i especially love that is completely looks like a shirt (its pants) because i don't have to worry about my skirt flying up as i race around the city. bra// no bra doesn't matter, which i love. as someone with a larger bottom then top and am pretty tall, i usually have trouble finding one piece items that aren't too short in the crotch/waist zone. very roomy without looking like a sack.",5
"I have been a loyal retailer customer for at least 10 years now, so i don't say this lightly; this might be my favorite clothing purchase ever. the overall design is incredible. the feminine detail in the embroidery combined with the traditional bomber style is done so well. i somehow snagged a medium petite and it is absolutely perfect. there is enough room to fit a sweater underneath, but the sleeves and waist are the perfect length! something which is difficult to find at 5'2"". also, i must say",5
"I've never owned a romper, and never had any desire to. but the classy design in black, soft, flowy fabric reeled me in, prompting me to push my boundaries a bit. i'm so glad i did. i don't think i have any other piece of clothing that makes me feel so classy or so fun, and certainly not at the same time. i wear it to work in an office environment with a cardigan, and the cardigan goes off after work as i run errands or play with the kids. i love it!! (and it even has pockets - i'm a sucker for",5

I love this sweater. comfortable and flattering. great for going out causal and staying warm!,5
"Just purchased it in store - very soft and cozy, great neutral color too. i am usually s, but bought it m just to have it slightly oversized.",5
"I think i'm on the opposite side of the fence when it comes to fit, because i love this dress. it may be because i don't have much hips or curve to my waist that this dress is not tight as it is on others. it does make me look like i have some shape down there because it doesn't cling. i ordered the holly green and i adore the shoulder detail. confused as to why that same detail follows along around the inside of the dress across the shoulders because it itches a little. i do have to wear a cami",5
"This sweater is such a cozy knitted dream. the mixed knit contrast trim/hood adds enough visual interest to keep it unique from other incarnations out there. it's a little open work but still snuggly warm with layers. the fit is very roomy but not sloppy looking, that's why i picked 'runs large' as you'd have to size down for a somewhat slimmer look. if i could afford to buy the other color now i would. i wish retailer would commission a green version. and a brown version. red too. what the heck,",5
"As others have mentioned, they're quite long. i'm 5'8"" and need to wear 2"" heels to make sure these don't drag. they're much tighter in the butt and thighs than my other pilco pants. i love the button detail at the ankles.",5
"I loved this classic bomber jacket online and in the brochure sent to my house, so i was thrilled to see it in my local retailer store. i anticipated that i would need a large, but i was wrong. the m fits perfectly! 
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist, size 10/12 in button-up or fitted tops,and dresses (usually 10) and a m in a loose-fit or knit top.
the m fits me just like the model in the photo, so i would think that you are between sizes like i usually am, you should size down. the z",5
"Flattering, flowy, comfortable. the back strops have elastic so easy on and off. flows when you walk, the ties have two different types of black fabric, matching knit on one side, a matte crepe on the other. love the pockets, very versatile piece.",5
"These corduroys are perfect! the flare is just enough to be current without seeming overly trendy or costumey. they make my legs look super long and look great with a professional top, or my favorite, with a drapery tshirt half tucked.
they are pretty long. i'm 5'5 with pretty long legs and i could use a 1"" hem, which shouldn't affect the style much. until then i'm wearing them with a 1.5 inch platform and they're perfect. highly recommend! if they still had my size in other colors in stock i wo",5
"Perhaps it is the 69's vibe that hit me, but i had to check this out with the free shipping week. i am so glad that i did!
i fear wool as i have sensitive skin but this is soft and snuggly. the structure will allow for fit over many different types of under-layers, but unlike so much offered lately, it is not huge or tent-like, but a perfect fit. it is a heavier weight - light coat weight? this is perfect for me in the south. the color is as pictured, golden. in my xxs petite, the sleeves are p",5
"I bought this jacket recently and i actually had been watching it in my retailer. store, but, they didn&#39;t have my size.  someone must have returned a size small and i scooped it up.  i probably would have bought the xs but, it was gone.  i went with it a little oversized and love it!  great quality and workmanship on the embroidery.   more like the items that retailer used to sell in 2004 and 2005!  super cute, love it!",5
"I went to my local retailer store on saturday to pick up some new cute things that i had my eye on.
after collecting the items i came in for i saw this romper! i tried it on and it was 'amazing""
 comfortable , soft and so versatile!!! bonus!!! i left so tremendously happy!! it will be a win for 
many years to come!!!!!!!!!!!",5
I'm always on the lookout for those special clothing items that add pizzazz to my wardrobe. this is one. i had been looking for a bomber jacket and tried many but this one falls elegantly and is really beautiful. i can't wait to show it off!,5
"This has quickly become my favorite sweater. i am thinking of getting another one in case mine wears out! it's comfy-cozy and soft. love it layered over t-shirts or long sleeved collared shirts, and am looking forward to trying it with a dress and bare legs once it's warmer out. it runs kind of big. i'm 5'8"" and usually a size 6/8 and i got an xs. the s fit too.",5
"I bought this dress as a consolation prize when another dress i wanted didn't suit me. i was shocked by how flattering it was, because on the hanger it was just ""meh"". the material is soft jersey, heathered, and it hangs well. it has a simple lining, but that doesn't interfere with the fit. it is a little low for my personal taste, so i wear a cami or scarf, but for those less well endowed, you'd probably be fine without one. for the record, i typically wear a 2-4, 125 pounds, 5'8, and 32 ddd br",5
"This dress is fantastic! it's super flattering and very versatile. for reference, i am 5'4"" and 155 lbs, and usually a size 8 - 10 in retailer dresses. the size medium fit perfectly. highly recommend this item!",5
"This dress is so comfortable and looks so good. i love the low back and the swing in the skirt. i ordered the tangerine, which is really more red than orange. this is a simple, slip-on dress, perfect for traveling as it doesn't wrinkle. i will wear this often when the warm weather arrives.",5
"This dress is lovely. i'm tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like, but i'm forcing myself to be economical. (i check regularly to see if it's on sale, however! then they're all mine!)
this dress is soft, comfortable, classy, and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back. my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra. this could be from my shape, however, because i am rather busty. the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean. it's one o",5
"Since this sold out so fast i ordered an xsp which is too short (i'm 5'5""), it also is too big! the empire waist has no shape or flatter, the sleeves are huge, the neckline was falling off my shoulder, i put it on and instantly knew this was all wrong.   the print is very fun and my guess is that's what is attracting everyone to it.  it looked like a big floppy mess of cute fabric on me.  back it goes.",1
"Lovely dress, fits great, very flattering, flirty, loved it so much ordered another one in a different color, can't wait for warm weather so i can wear these dresses",5
"I ordered this online and the colors are prettier in person. the blue and gray contrast nicely and have a beautiful sheen to them. i am usually a 2 at retailer and while that fit, i felt i could size down. i am slender and since it is a shift, there was little room in the waist/butt area. i ordered a 0 and that fit perfect! if you love blue (like i do), this dress is for you!",5
"Love these jeans. wish i could snag another pair because the fit is just on point, as is the wash. the side slit at the ankle really looks great with heels. a definite buy.",5
"I just purchased these jeans on-line in my regular petite size 27 (27-35-116lbs) as that's the size i almost always order but ended up exchanging them for the next size up and found the 28's to feel much more comfortable so i'd suggest sizing up one size. the jeans run a bit tight in the thigh and waist area and though i could also get away with wearing the 27's, i just personally prefer the fit of the 28's better. these jeans give a nice shape in the back, are super soft and are the same color",5
"The shorts have a linen look but have just a touch of stretch to them which is great for keeping their shape. i'm 5.7"" 140lbs and the shorts hit about 5"" down my thigh which is just long enough to cover but still sexy. the 29's fit but snug all over. the 30's gave a looser look but still fit in the waist. i have the navy and the mango. definitely recommend.",5
"First of all a caveat, i am not curvy at all. i am average height but petite in terms of features and bones and such. specifically, i am 5 feet 6 inches tall and about 123 pounds and boyishly shaped with a feminine and timeless style. all this means that i can get overwhelmed by dresses/clothes with a lot of fabric or large prints and such. if you are shaped like me, this dress will be perfect for you! it highlights your advantages (slim and petite) and give you curves (that i wish i had natural",5
"Sadly, i had to keep only a few dresses, not all of them, so that one is in my wish list if my xs petite goes on sale in red and blue, i am pal so that is hte better color for me. i have not seen the green in eprson, but the neutral color is very nice too, if you are not into red.

"Purchased the blue motif colorway which (as other reviewers mentioned) is cream, mushroom, black (heavier lines) and very dark navy (grid part). looks good with both my cropped and duster-length black cardigan. print is a nice balance between neutral and interesting. a lighter weight knit but still opaque and skims over (versus clings to) the body

"If you like the way this dress looks pictured, you'll love it when it arrives. the patterns and colors are vibrant, the fabric is of high-quality, and the dress is lined with a black slip. for sizing, i""m a size 2 or 4 and the xs is a great fit. while i often order petites for dresses - this petite was short enough on me to be mistaken for a tunic. (i'm 5'3).",5
"I purchased this in the green. nice print, not overwhelming. slips on, hides a bra, and was simply comfortable to wear. can easily be dressed up or down, but i was looking for a dress that i could slip on at the last minute to go out to dinner with friends. i took it on a trip to florida, and it did not wrinkle in my suitcase. what more can you ask for?",5
This dress is so flattering and comfortable. i got the green which is not too green. this is the perfect dress for a spring day and can be dressed up or dressed down.,5
"Purchased the petite size of these jeans and the length is perfect for my 5'3"" height. the description doesn't mention what length the petite size is but i believe it to be 31 inches. the jean is cut small in the hips and snug in the thighs so consider going up a size if you are curvy. great color and style. i may be 60 something but these jeans bring me back to my youth. love them.",5
"Since there were so many colors to choose from and the 20% full priced items sale was going on, i went in person to retailer to check these great dresses out. glad i did! online i was torn between several prints, but in the dressing room, there was a clear winner for me (just for personal preference. the prints are still all great!). these dresses are so flattering and comfortable. great with a cardigan or jacket for work or sandals for the weekend. definitely tts. i am pretty much always a m in e",5

The perfect simple black top. great fit - can be dressed up or down. closet staple!,5
"I got size 26 and they don't fit me as ankle, they fit me as long skinnies, but the quality is so good. they're smooth and stretchy, but they feel thick enough that when you pull them on you can tell it's quality denim. a great pant buy if you're looking for soft as butter grey jeans.",5
"In retailer's defense, silk chiffon in general is super fragile. got the top in turquoise and the color and design are beautiful!! i'm 5'3 117 lbs and took an xs, fits true to size. i'm able to wear a nude strapless bra with the top and looks great. i have worn the top a couple of times and by the end of the day i had a few snags. i was able to pull the thread back inside the top, never ever cut silk chiffon. i love the top so much, i bought a second one in the same color and size as a back up. un",5

"I saw this dress online and drove to the store to try it on. i love it! i bought the tangerine color which is really red and blue (not black). i am 5'7"", 130 pounds, 34b and i got the xs. the small was too loose in the upper portion and the arm holes were big, like another reviewer reported. i have a long torso and the dress fit perfectly. it's a lovely, soft fabric and i will take it traveling with me as it won't wrinkle (and it's washable).the back is cut low, but surprisingly my bra didn't sh",5

"Lovely dress, but i would recommend ordering a size smaller than you normally do.",5
"I had to return my original order to size down - the bottom half was fine with either size, but the medium was baggy in the back torso area. (i'm 5'8"", 150#). i bought the ""tangerine"" version, which really is more red than orange. it's versatile and can be paired with various third pieces and shoes. i do have a long torso and this waist is a bit short on me however.",5
"Green- feminine and flattering, love this dress!!",5
I just received this dress and tried it on. it's a nice dress that is flattering but the material was much heavier that i expected it to be. it's way to heavy to wear in the florida heat so unfortunately it's going back.,5
"I purchased this in both the black and the turquoise and wish they made more colors! this top is perfect for our florida 90 degree weather! i am usually a medium in tops (size 6-8), broad shoulders, size 36c and i purchased this in a 6p and a 6 (as they were out of petite in turquoise). i do prefer the 6p as i am 5'2"". i would say this runs generous as there is ample room to move. i wear mine with a nude bra on the turquoise top and the bra straps show a bit, but they are almost covered by the s",5

I ordered this dress on a whim because of the 20% off on mother's day weekend and i am so glad i did. this dress is very flattering. i have a hard time finding dresses that are a little loose but don't make me look fat. this dress has just the right cut. i recommend it for anyone who likes something not to tight but also flattering.,5
"Purchased dress in blue motif. love it. it is casual and comfortable, no fuss dress. love the sexy open scoop back that is just high enough to comfortably cover my bra strap.",5
"This is a beautiful summer dress. i especially love the exposed back which is the perfect cut to not show your bra and feels professional enough for work. plus it's comfortable, drapes nicely, and is machine wash and dry.",5
"I am so glad i returned this dress for a size down. i am 5'10"", and 160 lbs (curvy and muscular build), and the medium was surprisingly much too large on me. i returned it for a small, and oh my, it is perfect. i plan on wearing this to two summer weddings this year, and will then wear it for work. it really is a go-anywhere-do-anything sort of dress.",5
"I ordered the mango and the navy in size 28. i am 5' and 130 lbs. both arrived with the size 28 label on them, the mango fit perfectly. perfect length on the legs and very flattering. the navy, on the other hand, was an inch shorter and an inch narrower! i kept double-checking the packing slip and the label inside the shorts to see if they accidentally sent a 27p. but no, it was clearly a 28. i brought that back to the store and ordered another navy 28, hoping that pair was just mislabeled 28 or",5

Beautiful dress; i ended up getting it in both the red and the green. the fit is absolutely perfect and it flatters pretty much any figure. one thing i would say is that you should get your exact size if possible; i ordered it online because it was so pretty in the 4p. i happened to be in the store the next week and i ttried on the 4r in the store just to see how it looked and it was awful! i was so disappointed but then my dress arrived in the mail and the 4p fit me perfectly. i'm so glad retailer,5

"I love this sweater! i was nervous after reading the reviews, but ordered it anyway and i'm so glad i did. i got it in grey- the tie back/v-back feature is my favorite part-- flirty and feminine, unique but also subtle. i don't think the material is scratchy. it may not be as soft as some of my other retailer shirts, but i wouldn't call it scratchy. it was perfectly comfortable to me. i will say that it's a little short though. i vary between a m and l, depending on the shirt (5'9, long torso, 36c",5
"Lovely holiday blouse, flows at the bottom but doesn't bell out like some tunic blouses. the arms aren't cut in to much and i found that flattering to my shoulders the velvet and trim is strong and solid while the bottom half has a sweet little polka dot finish. charming and romantic.",5
"Super comfortable while also being very flattering. i'm 5'7, 135 lbs and ordered a size small which fits perfectly. i get lots of complements on the color, which is as pictured. love these for yoga, climbing, and lounging.",5
I love this brand and the 8 fits perfect. i am typically an 8 in retailer skirts and this is no exception. medium to heavy weight soft denim which is more of a darker denim shade with a wide a-line cut. the pockets are distinct and give the skirt character. it is pretty long and full looking on my 5'4 inch height. i purchased this on sale plus promo and very happy i was able to receive it as it became a sold out style in my size. the hem is a wide stitch hem and gives it a nice look. i look forwar,5
"This is a nice, simple, understated sweater. i got the green and the navy and they look different enough to keep both. it''s a throw-it-on-over-a-shirt sweater, with the right length to let whatever is underneath show. and the ribbon tie on the back is a nice touch.

i also like that the width of the sweater is an alternative to everything that's cut so tightly fitted - it's a nice width, with some room, without being boxy.",5
I was not sure how this would work on my short stature but it is truly cute. the color is a lovely cranberry red and the weight is light and versatile. this piece can be worn layered in fall and winter but also with crops or shorts and a tee in the spring and summer.,5
Love love! i am thick in waist and have thinner thighs and legs and these fit beautifully !! size down one size. very comfy. no muffin top or tummy rolling over and nice boyfriend look without being too baggy. very cute. so happy i found these. worth trying on.,5
"This top is so pretty and easy to wear. the material is super soft, it's long enough to tuck in as pictured but looks fine untucked. the back is gorgeous and will prompt me to wear my hair up to show it off! great purchase on retailer weekend, i'd be surprised if it lasts long enough to make it to sale.",5
Love this shirt. it is long enough in back to wear with leggings. it is very cute and casual on. not fitted at all. i am 5'2 and ordered a regular size so that it fits longer.,5
"Stylish. great color. great fir in between weather.
may need shortening but constructed in a way that will make it easy.",5
"Amazing dye so unique
you can put in washing machine no prob make sure you put in dryer with a non static dryer sheet for the dress to be super soft",5
"Chambray top that is soft, but thick/heavy so it drapes well and is very flattering on. untucked, the top is shorter in the front and longer in the back. it hangs like a tunic, almost a-line so do not size up or you will have too much material. i am a sz small in most retailer clothing, and the sz 2 fit nicely. sz 4 was too loose around my arms, and the sz 0 was too tight around my chest. nice neckline and a pop of surprise with the gorgeous lace detail in the back.",5
"I sized down from a 27 p to a 26 p because i like a less loose fit. if you want a slight baggy look then go with your usual size. i love the style, contrasting hem color and slight distressing look. great for end of summer into fall!",5
Very cute top. the sleeves were more quarter length on me. looks great with jeans,5
"If i could live in pilco jeans i would. maybe that's my goal for 2016. they are so comfortable and flattering! i sized down as others and i'm really happy with the fit. my other pilcos are a skin tight 30, but these are a comfortable 29.",5
I bought the xs in green and every time i wear it i get compliments all day. it's a more youthful style than i usually wear but i couldn't resist the dark green color. i wear this with black leggings and flats and it's a perfect dress for a school day.,5
"Great boyfriend style jeans. run large, though - i had to order a size down.",5
"This top is so beautiful and well made, and the detailing in the back is gorgeous. it's unexpected and makes this piece really special. it does run a tiny bit large; i've gotten retailer chambray a before, and they usually shrink a touch in the wash and then for just right. i haven't washed this yet, but even a little large it fits well and hangs nicely without being overly baggy. get this, you won't regret it!",5
This dress is very flattering and well made. i can hardly wait to wear it. it's one of my favorite retailer purchases.,5
"Although i find $150 a little pricey for a sleeveless sweater, buy it. i bought a size medium which fits me exactly. it is an off-white, which is what i wanted. i will be wearing it with a sweater skirt, for the ""sweater dress"" look. it is comfortable and versatile-also with a jacket.",5
"I just bought these jeans today & i absolutely love them!
i usually wear a 25 or 26 in any jean depending on the fit. i bought these in the 25 regular & they fit so perfect. they definitely are not a legging fit nor are they a baggy boyfriend style. on the tag these jeans are described as a girl fit - slim with a dash of ease. that describes the fit of these perfectly. they are not tight & not baggy at all, just a bit of ease - at least on me. i am 5' 5"" & the regular length is perfect. the fab",5
This jacket is beautiful! the embroidery is very well done! the jacket is fully lined in black. i usually wear a l/xl and definitely needed the xl as it runs a little small.,5
Just got these and they are great..i ordered mine online and took the advice of many reviewers to size down. i usually wear a 27 (sometimes a 26) but got these in a 26 and they are perfect. the material is soft and stretchy. would highly recommend these to all.,5
"I kept coming back to look at this vest for the color and design and finally gave in. vest is my favorite when dress layer. i hesitate because no descriptions about the model height, the vest may look perfect on her and look like a maxi dress on my 5'4"" body. it turned out just fine. the front is below my knees like the picture of the model. i love the beautiful red and the material that stretches just enough for my arms to move around . this is definitely a good buy.",5
"I just bought this shirt last week in stores and i love it! it looks different on me. i bought an xs, though i'm 5'8"" 135lbs. not typically an xs( though i'm pretty small on top). it's 3/4 sleeves on me and tight at my forarms. i love it! it so cute and you can't see in the picture but the design has a tiny bit of shimmer. the detail is cut out but not really see though so i don't feel like i have to wear a tank or anything under it as long as i wear a nude bra. did i mention i love it! i hope i",5
"This shirt is so great! i fell in love with it once i saw the back. if you're looking for a classic looking shirt with a little pizzazz, this is it. i have wide hips, and this tank if great because it's a little boxy without making me look huge. it's excellent quality, and i look forward to wearing this tank all spring and summer!",5
I pair this jacket with a black pencil skirt and it looks very put together. the embroidery is lovely and well done but the jacket would have been nicer with a polyester lining because it clings a little when you put it on. and it's an awfully heavy jacket for the summer. but overall i love it and how i look in it.  i think it runs true to size.,5
"Wow, i got this top in blue and i'm in love. love the whole off the shoulder trend and this does not disappoint. i sized a bit down ( usually get a 2) and i got a 0. since it fits a bit snug and the back shows the fau- tank in the bank, i find it really classy.. like your on-trend but not trying to bare too much skin. i think it could even be worn in a professional setting because of that. its very upscale looking in the navy. 
would totally buy different colors if it came in others, but i'm no",5
"Love the crochet detail on the back. yes, it does show the bottom band of your bra. i think i'm okay with that. i had on a magenta colored bra when i tried this on and it was a nice pop of color. i think the top runs tts to slightly big. if you're in between sizes i would go down. i am a 34b and i ordered a size 4. so i haven't tried on the 2 but i think it would fit too and not be quite as loose in the arm hole area. i'm sure this top will sell out before it hits sale.",5
"I wanted this top so bad i ordered one size up (only size left in navy) and it is a little big but i still love it. so fun, love the color.",5
"A really beautiful, well made dress. runs extremely big though! i'm not petite by any means and ordered a large but i'm positively swimming in it. an oversized look works for this particular dress, but i think it's supposed to be more fitted so i would recommend sizing down from what you might normally expect for a piece of this style.",5
"I saw this in the store and grabbed it to try on due to the material and the back. i was surprised how nice it felt on and how the back looked. i had a blue bra on and it really could not be seen which was a worry. i loved how the back lay and that it was shorter in the front. even for the sale price it was expensive, but i went home with it!! it will go great with long skirts, jeans, and any color pants. i was very happy to walk out of the store with it. i am 5'4"" and about 120. i have a slende",5
"These jeans run true to size, very comfy and i love the frayed bottoms",5
These jeans were so cute on- wore them a handful of times and they'd been washed twice. put them on and - rip! ripped right at the crotch in the front so not fixable- and on vacation no less when i had to scramble to find something else to wear. poor quality - disappointing and not what i expected from retailer. :-( they also run large even for a more relaxed fit- sized down for a good fit.,1
"Love these funky jeans. they are a little baggy, like boyfriend jeans. i wore them with a linen white tee and wore them dressed up with a silk top and boots for ""casual"" friday. they are versatile. love these jeans!",5
"So let me start by saying i love non-skinny cut jeans. i'm a curvy athletic type with thick legs, so when a jeans comes around with a ""generous"" fit, i'm thrilled! these jeans are generously cut through the hips and waist, giving it a boyfriend type of cut. the denim is soft, like your old favorite pair of jeans that have been washed 1000 times. i did size down one size and probably could have gone down one more size, but i still want a bit of a looser cut. pilcro denim always has stretch in the",5
Perfect fit and i've gotten so many compliments. i buy all my suits from here now!,5
Love this so much! i have received so manu compliments!,5
"This is a sweet, lightweight top that i will wear again and again. nice touches in the front and back. little keyhole opening with two buttons at the neck in back.",5
"This outfit was online for months with no review so i was skeptical to order but very glad i did as it is better in person. 
it is beautiful, high quality tommy bahama inspired suit. i am 55 so short shorts are risky even though i am a typical size 4 or 6. i took a 4 in the blazer and i am typically a high 4 or low 6 in size so i would say the blazer is very true to size. i took the size 8 in the shorts as i felt they ran small and i wanted the extra length. they ride a bit lower on my waist an",5
"Super cute and comfy, perfect for fall and winter (apre ski!). great with skinny jeans or leggings and ankle boots.",5
"I had my eyes on this top ever since i saw it online. i couldn't be happier with it. it is very comfortable, flattering and unique. i think it will wear well into the fall with black skinnies.",5
"This sweater is so beautiful on. it is thick material, but does not make you look boxy. it fits so nicely and is flattering. the design is just gorgeous. if you are considering this sweater-- get it, you won't regret it!

i'm normally a small (4-6) and i ordered a small. it fits true to size. the fit is *perfect* so if you want it slightly more relaxed, order one size up.",5
"Super comfortable and cute!! i have received tons of compliments one this dress. the material is soft and the print/colors are awesome. this dress will get a lot of use over fall, winter and spring. runs a little big. i am typically a s but chose the xs . love love love!",5
"This dress is short, but super flattering.  i was surprised when i tried it on in-store that i liked it as much as i did!  the lace detail around the neck is unique and beautiful.  i'm 135, 5'8"", 32dd and the small fits perfectly.  it's easy to wear and can be dressed down with tights and boots, or dressed up.",5
"Wanted this dress several months ago, but it was out of stock. finally was able to order and very glad i did, it is perfect! it fits exactly as i had hoped, the length is great, right above my knee and it hangs beautifully. looks great with my caramel colored boots and i received many compliments. just hoping they do some more drop waist dresses, especially for summer.",5
"I have a number of sweaters from moth, and they never disappoint. the ones made with this ultra soft and warm yarn are my favorite. i bought both colors :) i wear it with jeans or dressier clothes-- i'd say it's very versatile.",5
"The ivory color needs a little camisole or tank underneath. the sweater is beautifully knit and has a soft and nubby texture. hope it washes well. maybe size up if you want a looser, relaxed feel. hits me right around the hip bone and i am 5' 8"". can easily be dressed up or down with accessories.",5
"I love this sweater because it is an edge to it, fit is true to size and its soft and confortable",5
"Gorgeous pattern, even prettier in person! runs slightly large in my opinion, could size down. nice to have as a petite option.",5
"I saw this dress in the store & loved the print so much i had to try it on. i definitely do not own anything like this. i tried on a m & i agree that it runs large & on my petite hourglass frame it was a bit overwhelming. however, i was prepared for that & paired it with a brown belt & absolutely loved it. the belt made the dress a little shorter & definitely accentuated my curves in a good way. such a beautiful, casual dress that is actually comfortable. i can't wait to wear it with tights with",5
"I just love this dress! it is so pretty and feminine and comfortable. the colors and patterns are perfect for both spring and fall and i know that this is one piece that i will get a lot of use out of. originally, i thought the cut would be a bit boxy but it is not at all. in fact, the fabric is beautiful, soft, and flowy with a lovely bohemian aesthetic. it looks great with tights, tall boots and a big floppy wool hat. any one considering this dress should defiantly try it on, as it is highly u",5
"I originally wanted the black in 00p but it wasn't available around the date of my husband's company party. i was bummed out until my 2nd choice (the navy) was delivered and wow! i love this dress. i felt stunning without having to show much skin. i followed another reviewer's advice and applied pliers to the front fasteners. the zipper in the back is all it takes to slip in to this hot-mama piece. i wore this dress with a simple gold cuff, neutral colored pumps, and a gold clutch. i look forwar",5
"This is a gorgeous dress. the print is beautiful and unique, however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames. i would definitely recommend sizing down.",5
"Fabulous dress. i was looking for that one dress that i could spend a little money on and wear to a variety of events, mostly weddings. i received tons of compliments and was very comfortable in it. the hooks on the front of the dress to start to unhook themselves if you don't really clamp down on them, but that was the only issue. i don't know how flattering this would be on shorter ladies, only because it ends right around your knees.",5
This is baby soft and a great basic. i ordered my normal size large and it clings in an unattractive way so you might want to size up for a better fit if you're not going to wear it as a layer. the black color is saturated in a good way. it's also very long but i'm short so this would be perfect for taller frames.,5
"I love this jacket! i was hesitant to order, but i'm so glad i did. it's such a cute, unique blazer to add to my wardrobe. fit is very true to size for a blazer.",5
"I was in search of a few sweaters that were functional for the winter, but also fit my style. i will have to wear a camisole underneath, but i love the feel and the fit! i always have a problem finding sleeves that are long enough. the sleeves are an appropriate length.",5
"I love this dress! perfect with high boots. and the quality of fabric looks and feels great. fits just like it shows in the picture.

i am size 6 and i ordered the medium and its flows well on me. i like it a little looser for that boho look.",5
Great sweater. cozy and thick. the bands at the waist and wrists help keep this sweater in place. the loopy knitted fabric adds a bit of texture to the gray which makes it a little more exciting than your average gray sweater. i got a small and it fit perfectly.,5
"I have this in the blue/teal color, and i love it, so far! i'm considering buying it in other colors. this tee is stretchy, comfortable, and soft, even after being washed a few times. it fit true to size on me (xs), although it's a bit form-hugging, so if you want a looser fit, consider sizing up. the only thing about the blue is that it's not quite as dark as in the photo on the website. i wish retailer would make these kinds of basic tees more often!",5
"I love this dress because it's so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i don't generally wear. plus it's a three season dress with pockets! bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small. on top i'm a m/l girl and the medium is huge. i'm not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now. this dress looks good with or without a belt, with long boots, booties and sandals. so happy with this purchase!",5
"Byron lars knows how to make you look like a woman with his magical dresses!  i decided to get the navy (i also own the sold-out marguerite aka carissima in bronze) instead of the black or white since everyone and their mother owns it already.  the lace of the top is different--more delicate but less intricate.  it's still very beautiful.    my body type is inverted and the dress is hourglass, so the size 8p fits great on top but loose on my hips and rear.  i'm going to keep this dress and do mo",5
"When i ordered this online, i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10"" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope, it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled, or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute.",1
"This dress is one of my recent faves from retailer. the fit is great. i'm 5'8"" and 145. i ordered the small and it's perfect.",5
"My mom pointed out this dress in the store a while back and i said ""cute, but no way i could pull that off. ""i am a short curvy and busty lady and have never been able to wear strapless dresses. i ended up ordering it for a wedding and it was a perfect fit!!! i got the petite small and the fit up top is snug but comfortable and holds the ladies in with no bra needed. amazing. the fabric is dreamy and this dress is so easily dressed up or down. hides flaws, excellent all around.",5
Fits perfect!,5
"I ordered the navy/green combo in xl and it's prettier in person. the fit matches the model so it's true to size for me. it is loose through the body. it's not slimming but not widening either. if you like how it looks on the model, that's how it should be when you try it on.

it's soft and flowy and perfect for feeling comfortable. i love how the arms and chest are more fitted. the material has give to it. the stitching everywhere was well-done, no loose strands. it's a great basic. i'm going t",5
"Love the look of this poncho - which is not as large/billowy as i thought it would be. i tried it on as a whim in the store and fell in love. the colors are more beige than gray, for those of you with pale/blue underdone complexions. it may wash you out. love the orange knit running through to give it a little pop. i'm 5'9""/132 pounds, and the hem was a bit cropped on me. may want to consider a tank top or t-shirt underneath.",5
"The fair-isle details are gorgeous and the wool is thick, but not itchy. the neckline is a perfect crew cut style- not too tight, but compliments the neck itself. the stitching has a lot of beautiful neutral colors so you can wear this with jeans, blue or gray cords, etc. so many options!!!",5
"I really like this top, the material is thicker than i thought which is a good thing! it fits me very well and is very comfortable. i definitely recommend this shirt!",5
"Beautiful dress, stretch material makes sure it fits the figure nicely. great value.",5
"Tried on today, this dress has the most soft dreamy fabric i've ever felt. unfortunately for me, strapless dresses are not flattering on me, but for anyone looking for the perfect summer strapless, this is it. i am sad that it didn't work for me.",5
I tried this dress on today and ended up buying it. its a thicker material and looks better in person. more red and white striped with an uneven hem. the back of the dress is a bit more like a swim suit. i probably is best for smaller chests. i'm guessing it runs a little bit big - as the medium fit nicely on me and lately i'm a large medium/small large.,5
"I am waist-challenged. i like a narrowly cut structured sheath dress, sort of like the 60s styles. this is a great dress either belted or loose with great accessories and lovely shoes. it has so many colors in the pattern, you can wear this with anything, and the fabric is so high-end and quality that you can definitely wear this to work with a jacket and then change into a denim or leather jacket and tough high boots and go out for the evening in the fall-winter. it arrived in the mail and righ",5
"I've had my eye on this cute knit top for awhile and when there was a sale, i picked up both colors. they fit me like they do the model, a little loose and swingy, but not overly so. the colors look spot-on like the picture. i am rather top heavy, (34dd) but with the colors being darker on the top portion, i feel like this works without accentuating my bust too much. i am 5'4 and weigh 149, the medium worked out great. the knit is soft and it appears to be made well. the only drawback is a rough",5
There's a free people version of this top and this by far surpasses the fit of it. i'm 5'3 and purchased the xl and it fits me exactly like the model. i would say it is tts and extremely soft.,5
"Although the dress is heavy like other reviews mentioned, it is sturdy enough to not be see through and the material is extremely soft. i am currently an xs or small in nearly all retailer clothing however a d cup bra, i think that if you are a smaller person the dress may be too much to carry, but for those of us that find it is sometimes hard to get a great fit on top and still fitted through the waist ...it is perfect! many compliments & the hem is so fun...also other reviews mentioned the bow",5
"I love this dress. the fabric is butter soft, the strapless top stays in place and it hangs beautifully. it is such a wonderfully comfortable summer dress. as previously stated, i'm in love.",5
"Let's begin with the fabric....it's heavy, but not in a burdensome way. as soon as you put it on, you feel like you have a quality piece of clothing on. next: aesthetics---this dress is flowy and feminine. and a bonus, it made me look bustier than i am; perhaps because of the stripes. i didn't find myself pulling this dress up all the time. once i put it on, it stayed in place perfectly. bottom line: this dress goes from dressy to casual without a second thought. and it's on sale--grab this one",5
"Maeve did it again! great material, vivid color and amazing fit. i tried this dress on 2 weeks ago but didn't purchase. when i saw that they were having a sale i couldn't get to the store quick enough!
ladies, if you're bottom heavy like i am then this dress will make you look awesome!",5
"The retailer stylist had showed me this on my way out of the fitting room and i'm so glad she did. i went back in to try it on and loved it!! it almost has a ""spanx"" like stretch to the material which perfectly keeps its shape and is so well made. i also really liked the open part in the back because it adds an extra something to the dress but you can still wear a strapless bra if you desire. i plan on wearing it at the beach on the 4th of july:-)",5
"This is a gorgeous piece-the pattern and color combination are classic fall. the sleeves for a xs/s are slightly short (i am 5'8"") but the rest of the fit is great. with the type of fabric and poncho-style, i would recommend wearing something underneath.",5
"I love this dress. the fabric is a little heavy, so it won't blow away on a windy day (and bonus, even with my triple d chest i'm comfortable not wearing a bra with this) but may not be what you want to wear on a really hot day. the shape is flattering on any body type-i am 6 months pregnant and it still looks great. it can go from spring to summer to fall quite easily, with the addition of a jean jacket and some converse or vans instead of sandals. i'd absolutely recommend this dress.",5
"I love coats and have a collection of unique ones and this one is in my top 3! wow is it a stunner! totally different and very classy. not my every day coat but will be used for dinner outings and special occasions with the right outfit. i did reinforce the buttons since there had been many complaints about that, which is why i only gave it 4 stars for quality. great design on this one retailer!",5
"I bought a 2p when i should've bought a 0p. i was swimming in the 2p. however, it didn't matter, because everything was itchy, and i'm not even allergic to wool. the beautiful buttons are oddly placed to achieve that cool design, and just like other reviewers commented, you have to twist and contort them to get them to button...which, inevitably, will lead to them popping off. and i didn't see an extra one in case that happened. the coat is stunning, there's no argument about that, and i welcome",5
This t is very cute and comfortable. could be worn casually or dressed up a little bit with jeans.very cute pattern on the shoulder area. love this top!,5
Bought the green t shirt.  very pretty subtle floral detail near the shoulders.  love scalloped neck design.  this t is more sheer than the average t so i'll be layering it over a tank.  fit is true to size.,5
"Love the fit ! perfect for accomplishing the ""dressy jean"" look. i always take the same size in pilcro and this is true to size, but not stretchy as in some of the other pilco styles.",5
"This coat is so gorgeous, it's true to size, fits perfectly, warm and flattering.",5
"This dress is very beautiful and looks great on, however had to downsize one size.",5
I love this dress! i was worried it would swallow my petite frame but it is flowy yet flattering. i have worn it to several different occasions. it looks great with tights and boots and just flats. the lace detailing makes it unique.,5
"Love the coat. style and fit are a perfect fit. true to size.
thanks for the previous reviews about the button. i am extra careful taking it on and off. versatile. take the collar off and wear on a sweater or whatever inspires you.",5
"This dress is really flattering on. fits true to size. perfect length, i'm 5'6"" & dress hits just a few inches above my knees. it's simple, yet versatile seasonally. right now i plan to wear it with booties & sandals in the spring.",5
"Omg when i saw this coat in the baby blue i knew i had to have it. i tried it on and fell madly in love! i decided it was the only thing i needed in this world. it is soft and cozy. comfort with an old fashion hollywood glam. its almost sold out already, so grab it if you can cuz its divine! does run a little big, so i got a 0 instead of a 2 and its perfect.",5
"The fun coloring of this tee gives what would otherwise be a basic tee it's flare. it is a very soft shirt and will be cute with anything. the length is good too - you can tuck in or leave out. i believe it is tts. it might be a little sheer in some lights, but i think you could pull it off with a nude-colored bra. it's not sheer enough to me to warrant an undershirt.",5
"This top exceeded my expectations. i got it in the gray striped pattern, size small. it's probably the combination of the pattern and the removable padding that makes it very flattering on my small chested figure (i would imagine big chested gals would not find enough support in this one though). the fabric is very soft and comfortable with just enough stretch. overall, very happy with this top. but does it have to be so expensive, retailer?",5
I just tried these on at my local seattle store and ended buying a size up. i feel they ran small as i am usually a 29 in most and got the 31 in these. the 30 fit tight but it looked nothing special just like a very high rise mom jean and i was bursting the top button so this jean is made for hourglass bodies for sure. the 31 is loose and slouchy and it looked really different in a good way so it came home with me. they are a washed out black grey color with some tie die effects. did not care fo,5
"This coat is truly gorgeous in person. it's an investment coat, one that i will probably wear for years to come because the style is timeless and the color is lovely. i found it to be very high quality. in fact, i would love to see more coats of this caliber from retailer. the other reviews had me hesitant to splurge on it, but i don't plan on wearing it buttoned very often so that will be a non-issue for me. the lining is one of the best parts of the coat! show it off! i think the problem",5
I love these pants! they are very flattering. they do however run long so even though i'm 5'5'' the regulars were crazy long on me and the petite fit me perfectly. i was worried they would stretch out a lot but i've worn them twice and they haven't.,5
This top is awesome! it fits well and has a flattering shape. it's true to size and i love it!,5
"So glad to see high waisted jeans again! very soft, very comfortable, and the raw edge hem makes them just edgy enough!",5
"This is a bit pricey, but i think the akemi and kin quality is worth the price. this photo is quite inadequate to let you see the gorgeous dye color and floral detail. the sleeves are upturned and tacked; the curvy hem is very flattering, and the designer added a small triangle of cloth at the top of the curvy side, just to add to the careful, custom detail. the 60% cotton/40% modal is deliciously soft. the fine detail in cut, fit, artistic design will make this not simple tee a divine pleasure",5
I've gotten so many compliments. i'll never buy a bathing suit anywhere else. i buy all my suits from here now!,5
I love this tee. it is light weight and fits perfectly. the additional accents like cuff work and detail around the neck makes it original.,5
"I love this dress so much that i bought it in 2 colors: one in blue and one in orange. great style, comfortable and quality material. however, the cut is much, much deeper than it appears in the pictures. women with bust should be conscious of that. 

the blue is the better color. the orange looks more like a fluorescent, red-orange. still cute, but not as subtly muted as it appears in the pics. 

overall, great dress. even better with the sale price.",5
"I got this dress in navy for my engagement photos and i got so many compliments on the design and fit of the dress. it's very comfortable and stretchy so i got a 6 petite and it fit perfectly, where normally i need an 8 or a 10 because clothes are made so tight now. it was light weight and fit great in the bust and fell nicely over the hips. and for the bottom of the dress being white, it surprisingly wasn't see through. i wouldn't go wearing bright red under the dress but there is definitely no",5
"Love it - love the color, fabric and buttons. really comfortable! relaxed fit",5
This dress just fits weird. maybe it works for somebody..... there is a reason it has been put on sale...,1
"I bought the orange version during the tag sale and was so pleasantly surprised when it arrived. it fits very well and is made from thick, high quality material. i only wish they had more colors! 
sizing--i bought the 2p and it fits well, although a 0p may have fit better. the dress is fairly low cut on me, although i am small chested, but i wouldn't feel comfortable wearing it to work.",5
"I got this dress in the navy blue and it fits perfect. there is a little too much fabric in the middle, but it allows the dress the stretch more. the fabric on the button is a little thin and not lined, but you really can't see anything through it. i'm 5'2"" and usually purchase the petite, but the regular fit just fine and hit me about mid knee. the petite would have probably been too short.",5
"I ordered the black and white version online, and the dress fit perfectly. it was very well-made with a nicely textured, heavier cloth, and the overall appearance is very classy. it is a versatile dress, and i would highly recommend it!",5
"I normally take a small or medium in antrho tops, i ordered the xs/s and i'm kind of swimming in it. i think it's a good look though, and will complement shorts or skinny jeans. i could wear this through all seasons in the pnw so i expect to get a lot of use out of it! i was afraid the embroidered shoulders would be stiff and stick out but that isn't the case at all. the sweater is all soft and flowy, drapes nicely, and can be easily dressed up or down. worth the price.",5
As soon as i saw this piece online i knew i had to have it. like other reviewers the black flower part on the shoulders can be itchy underneath. it does run large but that's my style. i love pairing pieces like this with skinny jeans or leggings and booties. can be dressed up or down. highly recommend :),5
"Bought the green/blue - colors are bright, fabric is so soft. the neckline is just right for a small chest. the top is structured nicely, giving you a figure flattering fit.",5
"I love both the color of this sweater as well as the buttons on the cuffs. this sweater is an easy pick any day of the week and goes well with all of my work pants. plus, the soft and pretty pink adds some brightness to my otherwise dark winter wardrobe.",5
"I bought the blue/green color. it was absolutely beautiful...i paired it with a green sweater jacket for inside and took the sweater off as it warmed up. very comfortable, versatile, flexible and the color is rich. i am 5'5 and 147 pds and the m fit perfect.",5
This top is lovely! high quality yet delicate material and is the perfect weight to transition to autumn. the top is oversized yet flattering. paired with leggings it will be the perfect travel outfit for my upcoming trip. i can't wait to wear it over and over again!,5
"Love this poncho! it's casual, has a bit of a sexy vibe, comfy. great with leggings, probably boots once it's a little cooler. soft and lacey, lace is sheer so a cami is needed.",5
"I bought this in the orange color. might not be the color for everyone but with my coloring looked great, very similar to the picture online. fit is perfect, very comfortable. the fabric is night, stretching but flattering. bought this with the 30% off sale, not sure i would have paid full price based on the fabric. but love that i got if for extra off the sale. wish the others were in stock because i would have bought them too.",5
"I've always loved the idea of jumpsuits, but could never find one that worked -- either the print was too crazy, or the length was too long, or the waist line looked funky on me. this one worked perfectly. i'm 5'4"" and the regular xs fit nicely. can't wait to wear this, especially in the spring/summer.",5
"Absolutely love this piece! 5'6 and 120 lbs and ordered a small, fits perfectly. this jumpsuit has become a regular in my outfit rotation, i get compliments every time i wear it.",5
"This is the first romper i have have purchased and is so cute! i am in between a small and a medium usually (5'7, 135 lbs and athletic). the medium fit okay, but with some extra fabric--the small fit better and was much more flattering. the romper feel well-made. can't wait to wear it!",5
"This jumpsuit is great! i finally found a jumpsuit that works with my longer torso. the fabric is so comfortable and moves with you. i'm planning to pair a thick belt with the jumpsuit over the portion with the tie, just for some added detail while wearing the piece. it's quite easy to get in and out of.",5
"This sweater is absolutely gorgeous! the green is a lovely, rich shade and the material is wonderfully soft. i love the slightly slouchy fit, but it's far from looking shapeless. i bought my usual size small (5'8"", 140, straight athletic build, size 4/6) and i love it casually paired with boyfriend jeans and ankle boots or a little elevated with a skinny and heels.

i'm so happy to have tracked it down in our local store, i'd buy them all if there was more in stock!",5
"I love this sweater! i ordered the xs petite. it fits perfectly! it is soft. i hate itchy sweaters. the ""peach"" color is actually more pink, but i love the color. great buy! i'm ordering another one.",5
"Just purchased this in the lilac color in the store in my usual xs size. the cut and shape are very flattering, with the waist sitting lower than my natural waist. in person, the color looks very different than on the website. it is more a lovely neutral taupe to me. one thing is that the snap at the neck is placed about one half inch off in order for the neckline to lay flat. since this jumpsuit is so cute, i decided that this is an easy fix i can do myself.",5
"This sweater is comfy and light and the buttons are a great added detail. i bought this as a gift, but i tried it on anyways and almost kept it for myself! great for early spring days.",5
Love this top! perfect for fall/winter! it does run large but it looks great! love!,5
"This sweater is very warm yet light. the pink color is very cute, and the buttons are detailed very nicely! it hangs a bit low under the arms, and definitely tightens at the wrist. i ordered the xs size, and i find that i am unable to push the sleeves up. this is so beautiful and has a subtle uniqueness.",5
Tried this little number on in store...... i am 51 years old..... not a bad body.... gave this a shot. it looks minus my slightly wrinkled knees great ....and very close to what it looks like on model. very happy with one!!!,5
"I didn't go with the intention of even looking at a dress, but decided to try this on. once i did, i knew that i had to get it. it's so cute. i got the one listed as green motif, which is actually a royal blue bodice. the colors are vibrant and it's so comfortable.",5
"I'm 5'0 125 lbs and the petite small fits perfectly. i love the length of the shorts, not too short and not frumpy either. the waist has a hidden band so it hugs you in a good way and makes the top half slightly blousy, so it's forgiving. will go great with gray booties, black wedges or sandals.",5
I really like this dress. it has a very flattering cut and a stretchy forgiving fit so you could go your normal size or up a size and both would fit great. i got the red (orange) and i have worn it once and got 3 compliments in the few hours i was out.  great buy! especially on sale ;),5
"I love this romper. it's really flattering and well made. at most stores, i wear a medium but normally at retailer i wear a small. i had to exchange the small for a medium, but other than i really loved it!",5
"This sweater is so soft, beautiful and well made. it runs just a bit large, but i love the look.",5
"Ordered a size 0, my usual at retailer... very flattering, fits well",5
Pretty! can't wait to wear this in the fall. design is understated yet pretty. nice poncho:swing style. haven't worn it yet so i can't rate the durability or wash experience yet. glad i got this on sale!,5
"Cute, light summer dress. wish it worked for me. the tank part of the dress is light and super comfy. the bottom part of the dress is narrow and a bit fitted, doesn't work for a curvy bottomed girl.",5
I was drawn to the green/blue color in store! it's so cute and comfortable. i'm usually a size 2/4 and needed the 2. the bodice is flattering and the length was perfect on me. i'm even 4 months pregnant with my 2nd baby and this will work with my growing belly for another month or so. it's got great stretch!,5
I'm 5 9 with a slender build but have always found rompers to not be figure flattering.  however this one was perfect! not too short nor long and looks great! highly recommend!!,5
"I was not sure whether i would like an xs or a s. rompers can be tricky. i am 5'6"" 123lbs. i went ahead and ordered the xs and it is perfect. it is just long enough in the body for me. the shorts length is perfect, not too short or too long. i can't wait to wear this!",5
"Very comfortable, looks good on. like the fabric also.",5
"This dress is gorgeous in person. it is so much softer than it appears the photo and the fabric moves well. what you can't see from the picture is that the bodice sort of overhangs the skirt by an inch or so which is really nice for accentuating a small waist and separates the top from the bottom in a cool way. 

i am 5'6"" 135 lbs and curvy. 36-26-39 for reference. i ordered the 4 and it is loose although still flattering thanks to the forgiving cut. wish i had gotten a 2 but now they are sold",5
"I noticed some reviewers didn't like the loose shape of the dress. it is indeed a dress with a looser silhouette than most! but that's what makes it unique and expensive looking! i loved the extra material in the dress, especially in the back, it flowed gracefully and beautifully. i can imagine wearing this dress for many occasions and feeling instantly chic with minimal effort! :) it was also very figure flattering! i ordered the size l and it was a perfect knee length, so i would say this dres",5
"Cute top, perfect by itself or for layering. i sensed it would run large, so i ordered an xxs, 115 lbs, 5'2"".",5
"36dd, size 10/12 top and 12/14 bottom

these tank tops are literally the best thing i have ever purchased from retailer. the colors and patterns are gorgeous - i have four of these (yellow, green, navy birds and the white with navy flower)! the top layer and middle liner are heavy, high quality polyester. the bottom layer is a comfortable knit. the extra layers make this top warmer than most tanks - it's perfect for layering under a sweater or jacket. it's very loose and flowy. i could have",5
"Such a cute and comfy dress to wear. colors are vibrant just as they appear in the picture. the m fit was better for me than the small. ( 5'7', 140lbs for reference.) it's such a great dress to throw on and go. love it!",5
"I love this dress. i bought it 2 weeks ago and have already worn it 3 times, each time receiving multiple compliments. it is easy, comfortable and cute. also love that you can tie it in the back or the front. great dress!",5
"I saw this dress in the catalog and immediately ran to the store to purchase. then i realized the dress in the catalog is slightly different, but the small differences is what makes the catalog dress so much more unique and worth the money! look at the top, the stripe colors are different. and the stripes flow different on the skirt part as well. and the dress was short on me and i'm two inches shorter than the model. bummer.",1
I was worried at first that this dress might make me look like a circus tent but it is actually incredibly flattering. also super comfy! first day wearing if i got compliments from friends and strangers!,5
"Gorgeous, but so, so, small. recommend ordering 2 sizes up.",5
"This is not only comfortable but incredibly flattering. being 6'0"" it's also long enough for me.",5
"This dress is super cute, flattering and well made but it runs very small. i am usually a 6 so from other reviews i ordered an 8 and it is still tight in the hip area. it zips but the fabric pulls a bit in the front and it rides up when i walk. i am going to try and exchange it for a 10 because i think i'll get lots of wear out of it.",5
I love the cut of this dress. i can see how some would not like the way the arms are cut. i love the pockets and the way this dress flows when you walk it it. it's very fun to wear. i am wearing it to an awards show and was a little worried it may be too casual but the texture and weight of the fabric make it look more dressy. i will be getting a lot of mileage out of this dress.,5
"Love this dress and so sorry it's not available in xxs. tried on today in store and the xs was very large in the upper body. i normally wear a 2-4, so this was surprising. if you happen to need probably size 6 or larger, you're in luck!",5
"This dress looks cute online, but it is enormous. i bought a small, but it looked more like a 3x plus size. i tried it on, just in case, and honestly it looked like a great dress for a clown. this dress must have had two feet of fabric pinned behind the model in the photo.",1
I love this long knit skirt! it is great for any of the cooler seasons! it has a lovely somewhat a-line look when you have it on. the knit is a light weight but has a nice feel to it. true to size. i love the length to pair with tall boots!,5
"I absolutely love this dress! when i wear it i feel so graceful and pretty. the belt allows you to tie it so that if your weight fluctuates up or down, it still looks great. i think i'm going to be wearing this dress all summer. love, love, love. 

i think my only quibble would be that the lining on the inside fits more snugly than the dress itself, and when i was walking it rode up (it's like a stretchy mesh type material). but i'm carrying a few more pounds than i'd like right now. once i lo",5
"I have been eyeing this dress online for a while but never could justify the price. well, when it went on sale, i couldn't pass up the opportunity. it arrived today and is even better than i expected. very flattering cut, long enough for tall people (i'm 5'10"") and beautiful colors. 

i ordered s (my usual size in retailer dresses, i'm 145 lbs, 36c) and it fits perfectly. this will definitely be my go-to dress for the rest of the summer. i love all my retailer dresses but sometimes find them a tad",5
"I had high hopes for this top based on the photos, but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top. the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it, almost like a tie dye or slub effect.  not pretty at all.",1
Love this top!  it is fitted through the shoulders and arms and has a slight swing.  the peplum falls at a great spot and the material lays nicely.  very flattering on my 5 months postpartum body that is on the rebound.  i got the blue but i might get the pink too!,5
"I love this caftan! it can be worn belted as a dressier look or unbelted down to the pool or beach as more of a caftan. this is the perfect, versatile piece to have for the summer",5
"This dress is very cute. the material is high quality and as others have mentioned it isn't jet black, but more muted. the cut of the neckline is very flattering and the pockets are definitely a bonus. you could dress this up or down with flats or heels - it's very versatile. it will be perfect for summer and in the evening you can throw a sweater or even a moto jacket over it. definitely worth every penny.",5
"I was a little nervous to purchase this top as there were no previous reviews. but it intrigued me- especially with the sale price! i love it! i am 5' 6"" and got the small. it hits just at/below my knee in the front and a few inches above my ankle in the back. it is perfect with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings. what makes it go from a frumpy tunic to a cute flowy top is the slits up the side. a beautiful touch! the neck is very high- almost a cross between a turtle neck and a hooded look. i l",5
"I did not have the same experience as the other reviewers. found the color just as pictured - a dusty pink (made to look worn - so may not be your thing). fabric hangs nicely and is slimming on me. long enough for leggings but great with jeans, booties and long necklace (needs accessorizing). the aged look may not be for all, but overall i love it.",5
"I adore this dress, but i never would have bought it if i didn't wear it with a belt. as some reviewers have said, it's a sack. the belt takes care of this. it still isn't a slimming dress, but i really don't mind--the elegance and comfort make up for it.

i'm 5'10"", 34c, and curvy in the hips, and the medium fit perfectly. i could see this fitting strangely if you were larger in the bust.",5
"When i saw this top online, i thought i'd love it and immediately ordered it in both colors.  they arrived today and i am soooo disappointed.  i have never seen such drab colors.  the blue is a muddy grayish hue (like an overcast day) and the pink is a dusty shade of peach.  yuck.  and i was hoping the ruffle at the bottom would have a chiffon-like flowy effect.  instead, the ruffle is made of a cheap looking knit.  back these go...",1
Great color. great length. will go perfect with leggings and skinny jeans/pants. this will work well when the weather transitions and will be super cute under a cardigan when it gets cold.,5
"This dress is of excellent quality, made from fairly heavy fabric. the drape of the dress is beautiful - the dress definitely works if you're tall and slender. i'm 5'9, 32b, 125lbs, and i have the xs.",5
"Man, this dress is the worst. i don't understand how it looks the way it does on the model. agree with previous reviewer - there must be a minimum of 200 pins pulling the waves and waves of extra fabric back. this dress looks so cute , but is so, so, so disappointing in person. sweater collar and cuffs - stiff and bulky. dress - billowy and sack-like - not sure how they got a belt to pull it all in. save yourself the return and do not get sucked in by the sale price and extra sale discount like",1
"I wore this dress for this first time today, and it is a head-turner. sure to be a new favorite! i received several compliments while out running errands. the dress is flattering to my hourglass shape (i tied it in the back). it is not at all clingy; it flows nicely. the top of the dress is bra-friendly and not too low cut. i am 5'8"" and found the length to be just right for me; the medium skims the tops of my feet, and i wore the dress with flat sandals. unlike another reviewer, the dress i rec",5
"So disappointed. i love retailer! this was a huge disappointment. i am 5'3"" and 120 pounds. when i put it on, all i could think was that i looked just like a clown due to the big cowl neck and how large and round the dress made me look. if i wasn't so disappointed, i might have laughed. this had to have been a design mistake. i've truly never seen something so unflattering.",1
Such a great dress. fit is flattering. the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd. classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes. thrilled with purchase!,1
"I love this faux-fur coat. i wear it both dressed up & down. i usually wear xs but bought s so i could wear sweaters under it and the arms would still be long & i'm happy i did (5'4"" 103 for reference). the faux is soft & comfy. it's warm, but not blizzard warm. i get loads of compliments on it when i wear it & ""where did you get that?""
definitely worth the purchase on sale.",5
Unusual design and striking color make this the perfect dress this winter season. the fit is flattering and the design makes it perfect for work or play.,5
The material is wonderful and the dress is lined. plenty of room in the bodice area for a 36d bust. will be wearing a lot this season.,5
"I tried it on at store and went back to buy it once it hit the sale rack. not the kind of dress that grabbed my attention online, but once i put it on i knew that it would find a way to my closet. the fabric is high quality, and there is lots of it. the color, the weight, the pockets- i love everything about it. i see how it might not work for everyone, but for me (5'7, 135 lb, 36b) xs is a great fit.",5
"I don't usually wear maxi dresses because i am tall (5'10) so they usually aren't ""maxi"" on me. i'm also hourglass shaped and maxis with no waist definition make me look frumpy. this dress solves both those problems! it's very long and the waist has attached ties to define and keep it from being too billowy. it's also lined to the knees so you can wear with confidence but still have the bottom be light and breezy.",5
"I love this dress, the print is beautiful, the fabric has a nice heavy drape and the cut is simple but unique. i'm short and curvy so generally shapeless dresses don't work on me, this is an exception.

i ordered the regular instead of the petite and it is full length on me, which i think i like more than if it were a midi.

the armholes do cut in, i wasn't sure if i liked that until i sized down and it fit closer.

my husband chuckled that it's a little mrs. roper... i don't care, i'm wea",5
"Easy, fun and flattering. fits tts. i normally wear a m/l or 10/12. i ordered a large and it fits well. the tie at the back lets you wear it as tight or loose as you want it. the length is good for my 5'9 frame.",5
I wasn't expecting to love to this dress as much as i do.  the length and horizontal stripes (petite was sold out and my torso is square) are automatically two strikes but the sale-on-sale price was begging me to give it a go.  so glad i did!  the cut and flare are flattering.  the self to tie is slimming and can be styled different ways.  the regular length is doable when i wear platform wedges.  the colors scream summer and vacation fun.  my only problem is the feel of the fabric--liner is fin,5
"I am 5'3, 120 lbs and i got xs petite. it fits beautifully and hits me a couple inches above my ankle bone. as stated in my review title, the material is quite heavy and great quality, which helps it hang nicely. cut high enough under the armholes and snug enough under the arms and across the top of my chest so the fullness at the bottom is proportional. love it with my lace-up espadrilles!",5
This is a gorgeous dress. the fabric has the look of linen (though it is not) and the lining is a soft mesh. looks both relaxed and stylish.,5
"This top is just darling!  the body of the top is lightweight ""sweatshirt"" type material that's dyed to appear well used.  the ruffling along the bottom is color coordinated and beautifully textured.  great to wear with leggings!  the back hangs lower than the front so your rear will be covered.  extremely comfortable, machine washable.  an unexpectedly ""nicer than it looks online"" garment.  i bought the blue version which looks more lavender irl.",5
"It is one of the best dress for the season. light, nice color, elegant, can not find more word of it. really great buy! this brand has very special design that really amazed me recently. just want to give a+ to the designer.",5
"I cannot say enough good things about this dress. as a petite person (5'0), it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations, but this dress fit perfectly. it's also so well-made: the fabric is soft, comfortable, and gorgeously detailed, and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume (in a good, flattering way)! i got it shortened by about 2"", but this dress fits like a dream.",5
"I normally wear a size 12 because of my shoulders and back. after reading reviews after purchasing dress online, i was expecting it to be too small. it is, in fact, somewhat large. i love the way i feel in it. i am 5'8 and the length is perfect. i cannot wait to wear it. the black is so soft. love the boho feel, yet classic and feminine..",5
"Love this dress. great lightweight fabric, bold colors, and lined to the knee. the lining makes sure the dress lies smooth, but it breaths well so it doesn't add extra heat. i found it ran true to size and it's a good length for tall girls. i like that you can tie the belt in the front or back. looks great on it's own or dress it up with a statement necklace. there is also a nice girth to the skirt giving it lots of movement. great find.",5
"This is an amazing summer dress! so pretty it stood out even though only a few were left on the rack. it's light, airy and perfect even for the hottest summer days. the straps are not adjustable but for me the dress was not too low and it fit just like on the model pictured. a very thin belt comes with it but adds nothing ,only detracts. i am usually a s or m in retailer sizing and the s was perfect. 
 ( for ref. 5'7', 140 lbs) this dress is so flawless and beautiful and i feel wonderful wearing",5
"I am a petite girl, 5'2""/105 lbs- i bought size s and it fits me just right. i love the way the fabric feels on my body. i tried this dress with flat shoe and it doesn't make me look short. the colors are vibrant but not too bright which makes it perfect for any time of the year to wear.",5
"I tried on almost every dress in the shop today, and this is the dress. as soon as i tried it on i started twirling around. i felt beautiful and i couldn't stop smiling. my mother said that it makes my blue eyes glow. it flatters my figure by hanging perfectly across my bust-line, floating over my curves, and camouflaging my little unappealing bumps. also, the dress is cut nicely under the arms which allows coverage for a strapless bra. i chose the medium size even though i usually wear a large",5
"Love this dress! the other reviews were accurate. it is a lot of fabric and i can't decide whether i will actually use the belt that it came with. but i think it would be a great, beachy dress for the summer.",5
"Omg, i am 5'8 size 14, big hips and i simply love love, love this dress! when i first saw myself in the mirror i just loved the way it fell and gypsy style of it. the material is rich and soft. i caught it on sale under a hundred bucks and it is more than worth it!",5
"I tried these on in the store and they are super cozy. at 5'1"", they hit me just above the ankle in the regular length. i came to the website to get the petite length, hoping for a better fit in the rise as well as a slightly shorter leg length. these pants are comfortable without looking sloppy.",5
"Love everything about this. i bought this after reading other reviews. beautiful fabric, i'm 5'10"", 135 and bought the small and fits perfect. it's great with heels or flats... seriously just makes you want to twirl, dance, skip, you name it.",5
"I bought this beautiful  dress at the store yesterday and had some assistance from staff,  which was great.  the tie,  that another reviewer referred to, is essential,  i believe.  when tied in the back,  slightly high and sinched just enough to define smallest part of waist,  it falls beautifully and frames the center panel perfectly.  i, personally,   would never cut the tie off.  at least try it this way before making that decision.",5
"Got the petite size. dress is swing style, so extra fabric is expected. can wear a nude bra or strapless. dress is beautiful in person, more so than online. very comfy and stands out without being flashy, just pretty and different. nice silk (matte, not shiny).",5
"This dress is soft, comfortable, beautiful and drapes so nicely - not tent-like at all. i wasn't sure about sizing, and went with some reviewers who recommended sizing down, but the small in the strap/underarm area so i am exchanging for my usual medium. as another reviewer noted, you cannot adjust the straps, they are stitched together not tied together. i considered having it altered but was assured there are plenty in stock. i cannot wait for it to arrive! perfect for summer, or fall with a c",5
"Beautiful detail. sweater is warm, soft, and very comfortable. fits perfectly. i was worried without having seen it in person that the lace detailing would be fragile, but it is knitted into the underlying sweater material. i have worn it no less than five times already and not a flaw or a pull in it.",5
"Beautiful colors in this dress that can be worn as a swing dress, belted with the tie, or tied in the back. stunning!",5
"This is a perfect dress for summer in florida. it does run larger than it needs to be, even for a swing dress. no problem, i took in the sides several inches on each side, and it looks great. it's very easy to pick the stitches on the straps and make them adjustable.it has a nice, lightweight full lining. my new favorite dress.",5
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it. i love the colors and pattern. i've just been on the fence whether it complements my hippy frame. i'm a size 8/10 right now. i do like it with or without the tie for different effects. one concern is that the website says hand wash and the tag on the seam says dry clean only. i usually don't buy dry clean clothes, but might make an exception for this one.",5
"Everything about this dress is perfect for my body type.  i used the tie belt as a cinch to gather the fabric and made the silhouette into a loose fit & flare.  i have a large upper body and small lower half so maybe the excess fabric balances out my body but looks terrible on other shapes.  i am 36dd 140# 5'3"" and i purchased the medium petite.",5
Love love this skirt! quality is great and so comfortable. you can even do this skirt with boots and sweater in colder months! so glad i got it!!,5
"This dress had so much potential. looked cute when i received it. put it on & couldn't wait to take it off. it's shapeless, top heavy & just overall unflattering. the material could be cute....on a totally different dress. don't waste your money.",1
Excellent quality blouse and sooo pretyy!! i was worried when i saw on-line that is 100 % cotton. i though it was a cotton blouse that would get wrinkly. but i was pleasantly surprised when i saw it in the store! it is a substantial weight cotton/gauze that looks like hand stitched embroidery. i'd say it fits tts.,5
"I needed to get this hemmed about 3-4 inches, but it was well worth it. this is a gorgeous, effortlessly glam outfit. the material is silky soft, with some stretch, and drapes beautifully. i am a 12/14 and got an xl-- i think a large would have been better (this had extra width at the waist, but it worked with the tie belt). i loved wearing this and felt comfortable all night.",5
"This jacket was cute, however, i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare.  this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders.  it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me. this jacket is not sized correctly.",1
"This skirt is much more vivid in person, which i like. the fit though was off for me. i ordered my usual size medium. i wear a 6 or 8 in bottoms. the medium was fitted!! you could see every curve. definitely not comfortable with that! i would probably have a better fit with a size up, however, i am not a fan of the gray lining that you can see on the inner back portion of skirt... so i think i will pass on this one.",5
"The skirt material is super comfortable. hte cut is also pretty flattering, i don't hink this picture does the skirt justice. the regualr size was a little long on me, i would order a petite (if like me, you are 5'1.5""#, went xs #at 115 lbs). the skirt is also a bit stretchy, not stiff.

color is way prettier in person, i never looked twice at th skirt online, but in the store, it looked myuch prettier.",5
"Contrary to the first review, there is a zipper so while it wasn't easy to get on, it did fit over my bust. i found this too small and high waisted, and i already have a high waist so i can imagine it looking empire waisted on a normal torso. what i hated was the ridiculous inverted pleat in the front of the dress which is almost impossible to see in the online photo. it made my already busty frame even wider and more unflattering. the lining was nice and soft and the sleeve length and hemline l",1
"I have purchased many of retailer's henley tees throughout the years. this one is a bit special and just so feminine i had to get it black in my local store. i love the look of the crisp, white, but it was too sheer to wear to work without a cami, and i cannot layer camis in once it gets hot.

anyhow, this shirt is made in my favorite spring/summer tee shirt fabric: 100%s linen. linen gets so soft and drapey over time. the yoke is lace. the arms have a small ruching that is sewn, not buttoned up l",5
This skirt is super cute and a great easy skirt to wear with basically anything. but what is truly remarkable is the softness off its fabric. i found it in the store and wasn't sure i needed it but it felt so good i could not put it down!,5
"These are light and airy and pretty. they also tore the third time i wore them and not on a seam - a little above the knee while i was lying in my bed.

they also do not slim the figure and the fabric is slightly see-through as it is so thin, therefore if you are looking for serious lounge pants - great - i would not leave the house in them... or turn over in bed in them.

when i sit, the slits fall down around my thighs. my son complimented my dress the other day because the slits give way",1
"I saw this at a store today and am so glad i tried it on. i'm usually xs in retailer tops, but for this shirt i preferred s for a loose fit. the lace detail is elegant and very pretty.",5
Bought the dress online and it only has an eye and hook at the top. the waist has no stretch and their isn't a zipper. you have to be a contortionist to get it over your head and shoulders. so cute in the pic but not realistic. going back.,1
"Love! the detailing is so pretty! and finally!!! it's a top that's comfortably long. retailer has been making all of their tops so short lately! i'm 5'7"" and a dd. i ordered a large simply because it's a cotton tee and i didn't want a fitted look, per se. my only criticism would be that the material is a little thin in the front. i just ordered it in black too!",5
"Love me some pilcro jeans! these fit like the stet jeans.

i got my usual size 27p and the fit is good but not too tight. i am not crazy about the hem but they feel so good that they are worth it. they don't come above my ankle like on the model but come slightly below which i really like. i will say that if you want a true black, you may not like this color. they are more of a faded black.",5
"I bought this in the pattern in a size medium. i am a size 4-6 (38"" around the hips/butt). the small fit but felt very clingy to my curves. the medium gave me a little more wiggle room and didn't outline every curve of my butt. the material is very soft and comfortable, but it didn't feel thin or cheap or see-through. it has a nice weight to it. i am tall (almost 5' 9"") and it fit me just as it appears in the picture.",5
"I love this skirt - fits great, snug but comfortable and the length is perfect for wearing with ankle strap sandals. the material is soft and hangs nicely. my new favorite skirt. i am 5'8 and curvy - got the large, which was perfect for my fuller figure.",5
"Tried and pictured the regular size small. my stats are 34/35a-28-36 and i usually wear a 6 or an 8 on top in shirts and blazers. the small here was nicely loose so it might run a bit big.
in person, the colors are dark navy on light beige.
lovely heavy weight cotton and stitching.
i think it's deliberately a bit short, hit at my hip (i'm 5'6"") but i like this.
the 3/4"" sleeves are a bit nowhere for me...i wish they were full length but that's my only quibble.",5
This is going to be a favorite. the fabric is substantial without being heavy. it has a beautiful drape. this blouse is loose but skims the body closer rather than being blousy. it works perfectly worn with a skirt or pants and belted or tucked but is not too blousy if left unbelted. i purchased the black with the lovely feather pattern. the colors are vibrant. i'm always looking for something black with some color because i tend to wear a lot of black on the bottom. this fit true to size. i am,5
"This is a very pretty top with nice lace details. the linen makes it not quite as soft as 100% cotton but still comfortable and breathable. the fit was just right in the small petite. i tried it on in the store and was very tempted, but wound up not buying it because i have other similar tops. i would snap it up if it went on sale or if i needed a top of this type.",5
Have to disagree with previous posters. i found just one of these on the sale rack in my local retailer (someone returned it from online) and it was adorable on. got many compliments in the dressing room area. other customers asked if there were more available but it's turns out it's an online exclusive. it does have a zipper. i recommend sizing up not because it runs small (i think it's pretty true to size) but i think it looks better a bit loose/drapery. fabric is soft and pretty. tailoring is f,5
This skirt is so flattering and comfortable!,5
This shirt is really lovely. the fabric is soft and comfortable and the embroidery is very well done. it looks great with jeans and adds a little feminine touch to the look.,5
"Found this vest in the sale section, actually rolled up in a ball on the floor! what a great find. the colors and texture are rich. strong navy blue base with rich other shades and texture. yes the vest runs big, but if you tie it from the back the bulky look is gone! love this way to wear a cocoon cut vest! the vest is in a size xs/sm and on my build works like a typical medium would be. perfect for work and lovely with jeans and skirts. washable wool blend that is soft with nice structure. to",5
"I love this top. it looks exactly as pictured and has a very flattering fit. i ordered the black and it is somewhat sheer. the material has a slight burnout effect. the black can be worn without a cami but if i wear it to work, i will need to add one.",5
Very pretty top with beautiful lace detail both front and back. love the way the material feels and it hangs very nice....actually slimming. i purchased the black & would highly recommend.,5
"Love this blazer - it's a heavy jersey fabric, which is comfortable all day, with no wrinkling. and it has a cute light grey jersey knit trim around the pockets which adds visual interest and keeps it from being a boring navy blazer. the sizing is correct - i wear a 6, and the 6 fits perfectly. it's got a slightly athletic 'boyfriend' fit - it's not boxy, but don't look for a really skinny tight fit around the waste.",5
I love this t-shirt! it's a little bit dressy because of the lace but the t-shirt material is great for casual wear. i tried on the white but ended up buying the black because the white is so sheer. i'll still have to wear a layering tank with it but the black just feels less sheer for some reason. really cute and nice quality t-shirt!,5
Super comfortable; great with jeans or leggings. i would definitely order a size down.,5
I love this dress. i read the reviews on it before i purchased and they were spot on. i have broad shoulders so i ordered the large. it was still plenty roomy but i wore a royal blue sweater with it and it pulled the waist in just enough to make it fit without a belt. i would buy it again!!,5
"This is not my usual style, but the print is gorgeous and the dress is really high quality. i'm glad i purchased. it definitely runs big- i am usually an xs or s depending on brand but i ordered an xs p. it fits pretty well and falls at the perfect length just above my knees (i'm 5'3, 110). it's a little shapeless still but that's the look. i'm still sort of wondering if i should have gotten an xxs but the xs p definitely works especially for the length. can't wait to wear this. amazing sale pri",5
"This shirt is so comfortable, soft, and super cute. definitely recommend!",5
"The model does not look as good in this shirt as it looks in real life. it is flowy, flattering, and elegant, not to mention warm and soft. i hope it holds up!",5
"I adore this dress! it's so charming. great quality, lovely fabric, beautiful color. the fit is supposed to be boxy and probably won't work on a beautiful curvy body. with a petite athletic body, i feel beautiful in it! i wear a small or xs and i definitely needed an extra small. pair it with black or camel, sandals or boots, it's lovely!",5
"Flattering, comfortable, and a fantastically versatile color and style. if you'd like the garment to fit about how it does on the model, i'd say that it's tts. the picture represents the color accurately - is a very dark, slate grey. i've found that the color is a great neutral - i can wear it with other neutrals or with colors, as featured on the model. the style is also really versatile - i can wear it as a stand-alone t-shirt, or under a blazer to work.

i've washed the garment once on the",5
"I saw this online and didn't think twice about it but then i came across it at my local store and it's so much better in person! it is incredibly soft and cozy! i purchased the gray stripe version and two solid color versions (cream/forrest green.) i can see this being a great staple over the fall/winter with leggings, boots and a long pendant.",5
Extremely well made tank top. great for work or a night out.,5
"Love love love this turtleneck! it's soft and cozy, and i've already reached for it on several chilly days. it definitely runs large. i sized down and it still has an oversized, swingy shape.",5
Surprisingly flattering and so very soft and comfortable. have had many compliments on this. super cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. also purchased the ausaria infinity scarf in navy which contrasts nicely with this top. and a plus--no signs of pilling yet.,5
This dress is wonderful. fits perfect. very comfortable. wonderful colors.,5
"I'm a big ag fan, so i was excited to receive these for my birthday. i really love everything about them, but boy were they long!! even with a 3 inch heeled boot i was stepping on the hem. i'm 5'7"", so i don't often have to get things hemmed, but that was a must with these jeans. i recommend these jeans, but unless you're 6 foot tall, plan on running them to the tailors.",5
"Has to be one of my favorite retailer purchases! the shirt is so soft and can be paired with so many different items. the turtle neck will help keep you warm, although the actual material is a little thin. don't let that dissuade you though. you won't be disappointed by this purchase! i'm going to get the other color too :)",5
"Mutliple layers of buttery softness. i bought the blue and it's true to size. it is soo soft, i could wear this to sleep. it drapes beautifully. highly recommend it. now i want to buy all the colors!",5
"Great quality, beautiful print, definitely a steal given its current sale price. it does run large. order a size smaller. works perfect with a belt!",5
"This dress is gorgeous and feels so soft! looks great with booties and flats! can be paired with so much! jackets, scarfs, long necklaces! so glad i bought it! i did down size to a small from my usual medium! and got the regular instead of petite! fit great",5
This tunic is lovely and versatile. looks great over a pair of jeans or as a dress!,5
I never write reviews although i do most of my shopping online but i had to write one for this tunic. i got it in the blue and sized down from a small to extra small- although i ordered both to see. the smaller size fit better around the shoulders. it is a bit retro funky and elegant at the same time. great price for such a quality piece.,5
This top is very cute and is made out of soft material that isn't clingy at all. and you don't have to be stick thin for it to look good. i don't like to show my arms normally but this top is very flattering all around. i love it!,5
"This top is absolutely beautiful. i especially love the richness of the black and burgundy one! i am typically a size medium but purchased the large because i wanted it to fit a little bigger and longer - i was going for more of a tunic-style. if you're broad-shouldered like i am, you may opt for a bigger size as well because the sleeves can look a little silly if its too small.",5
I love this piece! they're calling it a tunic but its plenty long enough to wear without any pants. i usually wear a small/xsmall in retailer sizes and i definitely went with the xsmall. size down to avoid the potato sack look. i think this piece is so great for fall. definitely a must buy!,5
"Was excited to wear the dress for the first time. but while standing in front of the mirror putting makeup on, the seam between the body and sleeve just started to unravel. strangest thing - just a random hole appeared :(.",1
"I saw this on a model in the house and home catalog. it looked very comfy but with an edge of elegance. i saw it in store in the navy and loved it. the other color is very washed out, not good for me being a blonde. i didn't try it on, and got a small as it looked as it ran a little large. i'm 5'4"", 130 lbs. and it fit perfectly. it hits above knee, a little longer than on model. it hangs beautifully and the blue color is stunning, looks expensive. i received a few complements the first time i w",5
"The cut, fabric and detail on this dress is incredible. it runs a bit small though, usually i wear a 00p, but the 0p is plenty snug. 5'4'',110lbs,32c, fits just as on the model, looks much like photos, but slightly more yellow in tone.",5
"Cute top. agree with other reviewer that it is really nice in person. the colors are rich and the embroidery is beautiful. it is a very full swing top, but be aware that the sides are a few inches shorter than the front and back. this isn't evident in the photo shown. i usually wear a sm in retailer tops, and the small looks larger on me than how it fits on the model, in fullness and especially in the arms. it's still cute enough to keep, but i personally probably could have gone down a size.",5
Purchased this shirt for holiday photos and it worked great. very flattering and a fun take on plaid. more feminine than your classic plaid button down.,5
"I love the way this dress moves on you and the high low. a medium fit me perfectly. i am 5'8"" and the long part in the back barely touches the floor in flat shoes. the colors are sort of fall, but the top is like a sun dress. i think you could wear this any time of year with the appropriate accessories. i wore it with a 3/4 length sleeved cardigan and sandals in oct. and it was perfect. the fabric feels nice, great quality. it's on sale so you have nothing to loose!",5
I bought this in the blue motif and i love the colors of the plaid. the first day i wore it i received many compliments. the armholes are a bit low but i wore a cami underneath. i don't think it is that noticeable unless your arms are raised the whole time. i like my shirts to be a bit longer and this is perfect since i have a longer torso. i am normally a size 6/m/34b and the med fit perfectly.,5
"I love fitted top dresses like this but i find them hard to fit well on my body. this one fit perfectly, straps can be let out or taken in easily, and i get tons of comments on the print!",5
I just love this hoodie! it is so soft and comfortable. i am usually an extra small and that size fit me great. i wish it didn't have the brand on the back of it but i can get over that. this is a very cozy piece that i will wear many times.,5
Love this hoodie. so soft and goes with everything. highly recommend for comfort and style. great company.,5
"I bought this shirt in every color. i look sexy and the best part is how comfortable it is. it is very versatile. i wear it at networking semi formal events/ dinners/ going out with friends, and everywhere. i feel awesome with it.",5
"Absolutely love this little shift!!! i bought it on a whim really. it just harkened back to my crushed velvet loving days of the 80's! crushed velvet then was just something fuzzy that had been run over by a car and maybe thrown up on a few times at a punk rock bar :-) this is not that sort of velvet. it's also not some cheap polyester looking knock-off of true velvet. i always find those to have a somewhat ""plastic"" sheen to them. that is exactly what i was worried about judging from the pictur",5
Love this dress and so does my boyfriend. took my usual size 2 and it's a little snug but the 4 would have been too big.,5
"I absolutely love this dress! it's a great summer dress that's flirty and fun. i feel this dress runs pretty true to size except in the bust area. the buttons at the top pull a little bit on me unless i wear a bra that pushes the girls up and together. i'm a 32ddd just so you have an idea. i'm 5'10, about 145-150 lbs and i'm a 4-6. in dresses i'm usually able to get away with a 4. i have a bigger bust and bum but a super, tiny waist. i'm just barely able to get away with wearing a 4 in this dres",5
"This dress is very sweet and summery. i disagree with all the other reviewers who complain about their not being enough room in the chest. i wear a double d and i didn't notice any pulling, which is definitely a problem i've experienced in other button down dresses. i also appreciated that the straps were wide enough to cover a bra - though i definitely will have to have them shortened. the color is not particularly vibrant (kind of a soft yellow thoat might not be flattering on every skin tone)",5
"I ordered the 0p, in red and love these pants. the only problem is even in petites, these are long on me (maybe ok with 4 inch heels). the cut is comfortable and flattering, i have muscular thighs and these fall nicely on me. the color is also nice for this fall. i purchased last year's version (grey and turquoise, but reverse from what is offered this year) and they are very comparable (although i bought them too big last year). fabric not prone to easy wrinkling, highly recommend. (reference 1",5
I love this crushed velvet dress in the rich blue color . i plan to wear it with short peep toe boots and also with ankle leggings and flats. so glad velvet is in this year!,5
"Love these leggings. great fit, great look. perfect with boots and oversized sweater. bought a couple of different fabrics. highly recommend.",5
"I adore maeve tops, and this is no exception. i'm small on top (32a), ordered my usual maeve size 0. i'm 5'3, 105 lbs, ordered regular (not petite) because the front of this blouse is already short. fits appropriarely, but take note it is much more blousy than it appears in the photo. you have to try it on, either you'll love it or hate it. i do love it's slightly oversized blousy fit, so i was not hesitant to put it in the dryer on low for about 15-20 minutes. well... it shrunk up like nothing",5
"I actually paid full price for this over the winter and i'm not sorry i did. great top w/lovely fabric. i usually wear a small but in this top, an xs, so it runs a bit large.",5
"I look like i put a baggy bag over my head. also, the material really seemed like fake velvet to me.",1
"I've been hesitant with crushed velvet comeback...but this dress is adorable! first, it is not a tent; on me it's the perfect fit for the style - not too swingy but definitely not fitted. this is the dress you can grab on a day you don't feel like sucking it in, throw a blazer over it if you need you look professional, wear to a girls brunch with booties or a night out with the hubs. the little extra detail i didn't see online that was a pleasant style surprise is the almost strap-looking piece",5
"This top is a nice piece to transition into fall. it goes well with jeans, but it could also be dressed up with black pants.",5
"I was really nervous when ordering this dress because of the other reviews, but i couldn't get to a store during the mother's day event and really wanted this little number. it arrived yesterday and i'm already so excited to wear it, especially once i get just a tiny bit of a tan. i love the fact that it is yellow and white stripes with the dragonflies on top--the pattern is so much cuter in person than it appears online. the fabric is also a good weight, and it is lined, which greatly simplifie",5
"Runs a little big, but cute and comfortable. also shows bra straps a bit on each side, even when i ordered a size smaller. overall, very happy with it.",5
"Love love love this dress! i was worried the velvet would look cheap, but it absolutely does not! i bought an xxsmall and it is a little tight in the chest, but everything else fits perfectly ! i bought this in the slate color, but am seriously considering buying the lighter color as well!",5
"After reading many of the reviews stating the dress can have the potato sack look, i certainly had concerns. particularly since i am petite, hourglass, athletic, and approaching 50. i decided t give the blue shade a try. the lighter shade is beautiful but was afraid it would wash me out with my darker hair and olive-toned skin. let me start by saying the blue is so beautiful and rich looking. the velvet has such dimension and is no ordinary velvet material. it is also lined. when i first tried i",5
"Listen to all the reviews, size down! i got the dress in my usual size large thinking it would fit well size i have large hips and a booty, i was wrong!!! i could camp out in the large! it was super large!!!

got the medium and its fit amazingly! its a tad bit tight in the chest(barely tight) but im a 38dd and this is not an unusual thing for. i just need to wear a thinner bra and it will be perfect! cant wait to wear it! loving the velvet trend this fall! thinking about getting the blue too!",5
It is very cute. i think actual one is much better than the picture.,5
"I'm going to be straight out... this dress is very flattering and will get you a lot of male attention. so be warned!

i am a 34c and i got a size 2p. it fit's tight, but just right. i have no trouble with the buttons, at all. i am 5'4"" and it comes above my knee. the material is very quality and seems as it will last a very long time. i get complimented very often when i wear it.",5
This blouse looks even better in person. it fits true to size and is lightweight. i am not a huge fan of designs on shirts and usually stick with solids but i find this design to be very flattering. i just bought it today but i know i will get a lot of use out of it.,5
Love! color and fabric are beautiful! new fav,5
"Love! i am 5'3"" 118lbs with short legs and a long torso. i was worried these would be too long....they fit to perfection! super excited about this purchase",5
"Today was my first visit to our new store! the sales person had this on and i liked the medium tones of the colors. many times i hesitate to order because i never know if the brand will run small and this does not. if you wear a medium in michael kors shirts, order medium.",5
"I'm not sure why it's considered a ""blue motif,"" i think it's more on the black and cream side. other than that this is a great silk top for warmer weather, it's lightweight and airy and you'll probably want to wear a nude bra underneath. looks great with jeans and heels for a fun night out as well as trousers for work. i'm 5'7"" and almost 130 lbs with a 34a bust and a small fit great.",5
"I've worn this top with leggings and straight leg jeans. looks great with both. it's almost like a t shirt but not as clingy and way more style. i'm 5'3, 165 and the large fit great. it hid my leftover baby belly and still looked stylish with flats or boots. only complaintbis that the armholes are cut low, so side of my bra is visible. but overall it's well worth it!",5
"Love the crushed velvet and tried it on in the regular sizing in blue, but really needed the petite. although i tried on the xs in the regular sizing, i was afraid i'd need my normal sp, so i ordered that instead of the xsp. should have stuck with the xsp and will be exchanging it for that size. it definitely is dress length (but dowdy dress length in the regular for me at 5'1"") and the petite sizing is not all that much shorter, but enough to be cute. expecting a lot of use, especially over the",5
"This is a beautifully made jacket. i ended up buying the cream color as the yellow had sold out. the cream goes with everything, so that was probably the right decision. the inside of the jacket has a silk lining with a scotty dog pattern. the jacket fabric has just the right weight to hang properly, without being too heavy.",5
Love this dress and the color,5
"Runs small. great quality. haven't washed it yet, but guessing it will shrink if i dry it. awesome texture- waffle knit. i got the stripe. it has a removable palm tree pin!",5
"I love this dress! i rarely pay full price at retailer and couldn't take the risk of loosing this waiting for a sale. i tried on two different size 4 and a 2 and they all fit the same; a little large in the bust and the straps a tad long on the 4's. i typically can go between 2 and 4 at retailer, and with this dress the 2 was a better fit, i'm 34b and i had room in the bust on the 2 and the 4 was loose in the bust. i did t have any gaping issues others commented about. i'd have given it 5 sta",5
"I tried this dress on in the store but decided to think about it because of price. i ended up buying it later on line. i usually wear a medium (5' 7"" 128 lbs wide shoulders) but got a small in this dress. it does run the risk of looking like a sack but sizing down did the trick! the easy going loosness yet elegance is why i like it. it is so comfy but looks lucious. i plan to wear it often this fall and christmas.",5
"I saw this dress in the store and immediately grabbed it. i think that if i'd only seen it online i wouldn't have looked at it twice. in person, the fabric is so beautiful, a shining and classy velvet crinkle that could go way way dressy with the right accessories. this dress runs large, like all of floreat's items. i am 5'2"" 110# and normally wear an xs or 0, but had to size down to xxs petite for the right fit (like on the model). the only drawback is dry clean only. based on the content of th",5
"I purchased all 4 of the color/pattern offered. all fit beautifully and have washed up great with no shrinkage with line dry. the only pair i had retuned were the blue motif because they were made from a very different material with not near as much stretch and felt much smaller to me and not as comfortable. the pattern was cute and may work just fine with those who have a different build. i felt these were in general true to size. no doubt i will wear these all winter!
thanks antro!!",5
I love the off the shoulder trend but don't like having to wear a strapless bra so this style caught my eye. it is cute and different and people compliment me on it. swingy but flattering and i got the turquoise but i like it so much i just ordered another one in the black and white stripe.,5
"I have nothing but positive comments to say about this sweater. i'm 5'6, 130 pounds and i got a medium because my shoulders are a bit wide and my sweater fits me just as it does the model. it's not bulky but it is very warm, and the colors are out of this world! a very high quality and unusual piece that will be in my wardrobe for many years.",5
"This dress is very, very flattering which i was a little surprised about because i have a smaller chest! it is pretty long, coming to right around my knees and i love the buttons! i would say that the quality is not 100% there, it is very thin material but i am still very happy with it. i really wish they made this dress in other colors because i would buy them in a heartbeat! it is a perfect summer dress and i can't wait to wear it!!",5
"I&#39;ve been eyeing this dress for weeks. finally i took the plunge and bought it! the velvet is gorgeous and the style is fun and playful. i know many of the reviewers said it was running large, but i had to order an xl because i nearly got stuck in the l (no stretch). im normally a size 16 and carry most of my weight in my stomach butt and hips. definitely more of a shift than a swing. however its still just lovely. looking forward to paring it with a kimono for a wedding tomorrow!",5
Great little dress for a picnic. i am a 34dd and didn't have a problem buttoning the dress unlike another previous reviewer. i had purchased a size 8. my only reason for return was the price and my wallet! otherwise this well-made dress would still be in my closet! love the buttons.,5
"I tried the red version at store, it fit really good and i loved it. then i found the blue version online and liked even more. it can be worn for business and casual.",5
Love these leggings & the color. i haven't been able to find a pair of great brown leggings for years. i was concerned the small might not fit but they are perfect,5
"I love this shirt!!! the front is a little shorter than i thought it would be, but overall, it is so cute and comfy!! wish they had it in more colors!!",5
"Love this shirt! it runs a bit big, i ordered the (petite) 4 and its a bit long in the sleeves if i don't roll them up, and a bit long and big in the back. but i love the look and it is classic. great with skinny jeans.",5
"I am not someone who normally wears overalls (this is actually my first pair!) but i'm so glad that i took the plunge and bought these. they fit amazingly while being both perfectly trendy and perfectly timeless. if you are on the fence about overalls in general, these are a perfect first pair.

i'm a 25 in most denim brands and was also a 25 in these. the bottom portion fits perfectly and doesn't look sloppy (like i assumed overalls would be) at all! the top is perfectly casual. 

i'm so ha",5
"I have been dreaming of the perfect overall that i can live in this spring/summer. these overalls completely fit the bill. i would normally wear a size 24, but i wanted the fit to be more relaxed with a slight slouchy look. i went with a a size 25 and they are exactly what i wanted. i feel like i can move around feely in these. they are extremely comfortable and the denim is pretty lightweight. i highly recommend these!",5
"Love these. wearing them today with a longer tunic style denim shirt and cardigan and boots. nice subtle print. i think they run about 1 size small. i'm normally a size 0/25. the xs was a bit snug and the material stretched so you could see white around the seams where the print pulled. size s fits great without any pulling and waistband comes up far enough. incidentally, i like them so much bought the same leggings in plain black elsewhere and the size s was the best fit in those too. love love",5
"I have a pair of elevenses very similar to the turquoise and grey pair, and i get non-stop compliments on them. they are very flattering and drape beautifully. the fabric is also complete no-fuss and no-fade. this time, i went for the red pair, and i love them. they really go with the current upscale 70s vibe; they have the 70s attitude without the poor quality of most vintage 70s clothes.",5
"The fabric is divine. it's a thin polyester knit that just floats on your body. it's soft and drapes wonderfully. it's like wearing a nightgown. 

the styling is so sexy. it looks really alluring but it's actually just a plain ol' tank top with a bit of a sleeve dangling at the elbows. it's very modest really.

the silly thing is, it tickles! yeah those dangling ties tickle your arms when you move. lol

i bought the grey in a xl and the fit is perfect. it says ""dark grey"" but it's really l",5
"I love these pants, they are a great addition to my work wardrobe. the fit is very flattering, with the wide legs falling perfectly, and they are a great length. i got the red, which is a beautiful and brighter than the pics. the fabric is a nice weight, perfect for fl winters. i personally like the mid-rise as it helps with tucking in shirts that are on the shorter side. i highly recommend these pants as a nice alternative in color and cut for the office. i'm 5'7"" and 135lbs and i purchased the",5
"Saw this at the store and it is breathtaking in person. as the previous reviewer stated, i too consider this a dress and not a tunic, and it's not really crinkled either. the dress is structured, very soft, and so gorgeous on. i tried on a regular x-small and it fit but a bit uncomfortable at the mid section. the small fit better (it's meant to be a bit loose, bohemian looking) and the hem falls right at my knees which is perfect for the office (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). i have medium o",5
I just received this and absolutely love it !!! i love cold shoulder designs and this one is unique and so well made. i am usually a size small and it fit perfectly. i would say it runs true to size and will look perfect with white or black pants and a cute sandal. i am so glad i got it. love the quality .,5
I was a bit unsure when ordering because of the cut of this blouse. i have a lean athletic torso but i am a 32dd. sometimes tops like this can make me look heavy or pregnant. love the fit though. it fits lovely and comfy. it goes well with jeans or cream colored pants and will be a nice addition to my spring wardrobe.,5
"Love this dress!! i ordered the blue for some color and it is nicer in person than in the photo. the fabric and color are beautiful. can dress this up or wear for work. i am 5', 110 lbs and 35/26/35 and got the size xs petite. it is a loose fit but not too loose. very unique dress that i can wear all fall and winter.",5
"You have to give this dress a try - yes, it runs small - i'm usually a 4 in retailer dresses. / 32dd 5'5"" 130lb - i couldn't button the top button with my bra on but i could without it on - it fit perfect every where else. it is very flattering in every way. it's 100% cotton, lightweight, and soft. the flare does not have too much fabric and is actually slimming unlike other fit and flare dresses. the sz 6 fit more comfortable and i could wear my bra which looked better and gave my breasts a lift",5
This is very cute. i got a lot of compliments when i wore it. i'm 5'10 so i always struggle with tops being too short but this was ok,5
"I got a m in this top and was a little scared but i absolutly love this top, i was debating on it and then caught it on the 30% off sale, my first retailer purchase and it definitely won't be my last! great quality, so comfortable, and very cute!",5
This is the perfect dress to wear casual or dress up a bit - perfect for fall and super comfy!,5
"I love this dress. it is a fun and flirty summer dress. i think it can be dressed up or worn casually. i am a 36c, 29"" waist, 40"" hips. i bought a size 8 and it fits me great. as others said, it is a little snug across the chest, but i think it is supposed to be. with the proper bra it fits very comfortably! i am going to wear it for mother's day brunch!",5
"Rec'd so many compliments on this.  absolutely beautiful, comfortable and versatile.  try it with white crops and cute heels!",5
I have featured two pictures below. one is size s. the other is xs petite. i'm 5 feet 120 and a 34 d. i highly recommend this dress. i definitely could have gone either way. but felt sizing down would be more flattering.,5
"I actually love the thickness of the cotton fabric on this top. i am tired of too thin shirts that develop holes right away. i love the color too.i am usually a medium and the medium fits well, if a little roomy.",5
I just received this in the mail today and i love it! its adorable- very flattering and hides all the spots you'd want hidden. i don't find that this runs too large. i ordered my usual size large and it fits tts. it's not meant to fit snug. i ordered this in the navy color- beautiful and flattering!,5
"Love the detail, quality of make and fabric, comfort.  i've been looking for a top like this.  expect that it  will wash fine. it's not see through and i always wear a nude bra.  got xs in white and it fits well, not too loose and billowy.  i'm 5'2"", 115#. highly recommend.",5
"I'm not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake, but i received the chiffon shell, but there was no slip as pictured. it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer. i had high hopes, but sadly, this is being returned. the xs is out of stock now, so i can't even reorder. bummer.",1
"The design and fabric on this suit are even more gorgeous in person than on-line. i am 5'4"" and between 138/140 and ordered a medium. the thing i especially like about this suit is that it has adequate cup size and support. i am a 36c or d depending on the bra and this suit is very flattering and provides nice coverage and cup support. the straps can be shortened if you want a little more bust support. the material and design of the suit itself feel substantial and even without the straps, it do",5
"The ruching on this suit is super flattering. i ordered the medium -- i am 5' 6"", 150 lbs, and usually a solid ""medium"" in most retailer items -- though i would definitely recommend sizing up with this guy. i was able to get it on (and it certainly held everything in place), but since it is a one piece, pulling it on was a bit of a struggle and i certainly could have used about an inch more fabric from top to bottom. i will be returning and exchanging for a large.",5
I loved this dress. i kept putting it on trying to figure out how to get my boobs to not fall out all over the place. this is not a dress for larger breasts. it is absolutely beautiful otherwise!,5
I love this dress. i think it will be awesome to wear this summer but also a great transition piece into fall. very boho!,5
"I purchased these pants once i saw them go on sale. i had seen them a little while back but with summer coming to an end, i didn't want to spend $88 for a pant a wouldn't wear often. the $49 plus 20% off is a great price. they are really cute and just as pictured. good quality too. however, they were at least 3 inches too long. i am 110lbs, 5'3"" and ordered the xs like i always do. they fit perfectly except for the length. worth the $20 to get hemmed.",5
"These pants are nothing short of amazing! they have a great wide leg with plenty of beautiful flow to them. i am 6 months pregnant and can wear them under my bump, but they are by no means maternity pants (i have only gained 8 lbs). they have a nice silky material that will be great for hot summer weather and will be great, comfortable travel pants. the only downfall is the length. i am 5'6"" with long legs and will have to get 2-3 inches chopped off.",5
"I have 2 of these now by the same designer. it's comfortable and will be a staple in my closet for summer, early fall and spring. it is a little on the long end but with platform heels, it's perfect.",5
"I noticed the reddish one (actually, barney-purple) in my local store and had to try it one, since i like this cut of dresses from my teenage years. the color was my main concern, but this proved perfect overall. it is low cut in the bust, but a scarf can fix it for us modest girls. there were quite a few loose threads on the lace and stiching that i had to trim off. for the reference, i am 5'4"", 120 lbs, and an xs was perfect.",5
"I felt comfortable wearing this to a party. easy to wear and accessorize
.",5
"I love these pants. saw them in-store & couldn't do it at full price but they're a steal on sale. super soft & comfy. love the wide leg. fits true to size. i'm 5'2"" 125 lbs & ordered the xs bc no petite. waistband fits a bit tight but i prefer that to them slipping down. would buy again,",5
"Only thing is the fit is a little loose, so i wish the xxs petite wasn't sold out (or that there was a xxs#. at 115 lbs, i tried on e xs regular, that made the skirt a maxi on me #5'1.5""# and it was nice, but a bit loose. i would have worn it as a sexy strapless #i tried it, just not daring enough to actually wear it like that). so i ordered the xs petite, we shall see.

the navy and beige is a nice classy combo, i could see it being pulled off in all seasons, depending how you pair it.",5
"While the blue color pictured is stunning, i purchased the white poplin in store. two best features? the ruffle on the neckline continues across the back and dips into a small ""v"" ( a great detail, especially for short or swept-up hair during summer months). next, this white fabric's crisp finish is coupled with a ""just right"" weight (solid enough to be opaque, but light enough for warm days). plan to pair it with skinny jeans throughout spring and summer. thrilled!",5
"This skirt is really cute. it's body conscious but not tight. the material is soft and stretchy, making it flattering and comfy. while it's smooth in the back, the draping in the front could hide tummy issues. as another reviewer said, you can dress this skirt up or down. i typically wear a s/4 in bottoms at retailer and the s fit tts. also, i love the different take on the high-low hem.",5
"Yep, absolutely tickled to death with this top. light, airy, cotton poplin with personality plus. such an aesthetically pleasing piece! i haven't been this pleased with an article of clothing in some time! this blouse speaks to me...i am 5'5"" 142 lbs and the size eight was a tad large-might have gotten a six but this is fine. it is very blousy on the bottom but when it speaks to me it says 'belt' or 'tuck' anyway! the neckline is just too much! it gives such personality to the piece. the open ne",5
"I was so excited when these pants went on sale! tried them on in-store and ordered online. tried both medium and small and they both work, thanks to the elastic waistline. they do run very long, so if you're super tall these are great, otherwise prepare to wear very tall heels or get them hemmed.",5
"I love this dress! good for work or social occasions. flowy fabric, and not boxy. the length is perfect, not too short.  i can't wait to wear it. picture is accurate as to color.",5
"The pants are everything i expected and much more! the material is a delicious and light weight. the colors are beautiful-white base with jade green and black design. there is a very comfortable elastic band waist with tie. i am 5'9"" and ordered the longer length and they are just to the ground. i weigh 140 and have a slim figure and the medium is a very comfortable fit. i would highly recommend these if you like looks that are up to date and comfy-these are a win-win!",5
"I really love these pants as ""loungers"". not sure i would wear them outside the house, because the legs are very wide.. yes, the elastic has the problem that others have mentioned, but i just hold it in place when i pull them on and it stays put. but the fabric is so soft that i put them on every night after work and sometimes don't take them off before bed. pockets are a nice touch - something i have come to love about retailer pants.",5
"I tried this skirt on in the store, it fit like a glove (that doesn't happen very often for me) but couldn't find the right top to pair w/ it so i passed on it, but when i got home i found the perfect top already in my closet! so, i ordered it online, it doesn't seem to lay quite as nice as the one i tried on in the store, but i'm keeping it regardless. highly recommended this skirt! fits tts.",5
"This skirt looks great on, i didn't even think before buying it, planning to wear it all summer. so the aesthetic is great. quality and design, not so much. you get exactly one good wear out of it before the folding absolutely disintegrates, it is not sewn in or built to last. 

then, it looks like a cheap sarong over a cheap miniskirt. i thought the dry cleaner might be able to fix it, but they said they would have to resew the whole garment, not exactly what you want to hear with almost bran",1
"I fell in love with this top on the spot and paid full price for it, which is a rarity, since everything goes on sale. it's a beautify top, well made and sits well on me. i am 5'6"", usually wear a size 10 but got away with an 8 in this one. i do have short torso, so i can see it having a problem for someone with long torso or someone who's tall. what's even better is that it went on sale and the store was nice enough to give me the difference back. i'm thinking about getting the other two colors",5
"This dress was a 'maybe' for me online but when i tried it on i was totally won over! i got the raspberry, which is a really pretty color. i have 34dd chest and it fits nicely on me, fairly true to size and is super flattering on me- more so than most swing dresses. love it.",5
"I love flowy pants like these. pattern looks different, the green is pale, like on the far right. smocking is a beautiful touch and they are a nice weight and well made. had to hem them up about 2"" and i'm 5'8"", about 180. xl fits perfectly.",5
"Really cute skirt. found it to be too much material on my frame - 5'4. would look really great on someone taller. the tie in the front was pretty, but a bit bulky on me and ultimately i want a skirt i can wear both ways - with shirts tucked in or out. this one is tuck in only so sending back. will look really great on someone else though! nice knee length skirt.",5
"Love the colors!! i'm 5'2"" and the regular goes down to my ankles like a petite dress would normally. if you get petite, it would be as high as it is on the model. the material is comfortable and i can see this as a pretty versatile piece.",5
"I am 5'7"" and wanted a swing type of dress that wasn't too short to be too young or too long to look frumpy and this fits perfect. it's very comfortable. it has nice quality in the fabric... not all polyester like many of the swing dresses out now. 

it's a bit longer in the back and has a very ethereal quality without being childlike. it's pretty, the sleeves are long enough and the elastic fits well. no pinching. i can wear a full bra with it and both boots and super sexy heels look great wi",5
"This skirt looks very nice in person and it hugs one's cure beautifully. the hem is uneven which makes it more interesting. i am 5'2"", 120lbs, tried it in the navy/beige color in size s and size xs, and i found size xs fits better. the fabric is soft and stretchy, and it drapes well. because i am petite, the length of the normal size fits me more like a maxi skirt (it goes all the way down to my mid calf). unfortunately, the petite xs is sold out, so i have to settle with the normal size xs. sti",5
"I purchased this dress in the berry color. it is beautiful and feminine. the length fit just like in the picture. i love all the detail and ease of this dress. i'm 5'2"" 34d and purchased a size 2. it fits true to size.",5
"A perfect summer dress! beautiful print and is extremely flattering for a curvy frame! i have worn this dress twice and have received at least 2 compliments each time! only note... wearing a bra with this dress isn't really a possibility due to the back detail. its pasties or if you're okay being ""free flowing"" & your chest isn't too large.. you can get away with it! ;)",5
"This is one of those ""why we shop at retailer dresses.""

this dress arrived today - via lasership - in an actual box! both deliveries from this service far surpass fedex, ups and certainly usps which crams an expensive item in an unprotected plastic bag into the mailbox!!! okay - off my soapbox and thanks for the free shipping weekend!

raspberry is quite beautiful - truly as pictured. the lacework should be more resilient than many. the shape is reigned in by the bodice (not elastic btw) and the",5
"Love this top, looks really cute with a pair of high waist jeans. it is a nice thick cotton fabric that does not stretch out after wearing. it is short, so for me the high waist pants were a must, but if you don't mind showing your belly, then it would be cute with anything, the boat neck collar is not so wide that it shows your bra straps as with some. overall it was a good fit.",5
"I loved these online and am even more in love since receiving them in the mail. the band on top is a great touch for these flowy pants! i'm 5'9 and they are still a little long, but other than that they are perfect.",5
"I bought these yesterday and i love them! they are super comfortable, and are the perfect length and size. i'm 5'8 and 150. i tried on both the small and medium (small for kicks, but turns out they were a better fit!). the medium fit great too-albeit a little baggy on the thigh. these are now my go to pants for summer, and travel! i can't wait to start wearing them!",5
"This is so comfortable and so flattering. i got it in two colors. i think it runs tts. i sized up so i could wear it lower on my hips. i'm 5'2"" and got the regular size rather than petite and it's more of a maxi skirt on me--way longer than on the model. this is what i wanted (i can never find maxi skirts that aren't way too long even when i try petite), but if you want it more midi, go for petite sizing.",5
"I splurged on this pajama set for myself and now regret it. even though the design is adorable, the knitted fabric contains acrylic and started pilling a lot within the first week of wear. after a month and a couple washes, it looks horrible. it may be the worst case of pilling i've ever seen in a fabric. so so disappointed. it initially fit true to size but has stretched out a bit over time.",1
"I am 5'2"", 110 lbs and i ordered my usual size xs and they fit perfectly. they are so soft and comfortable and keep me very warm. i can't wait to take them with me when we go to the snow next month!",5
"It's lightweight, which is perfect for summer officewear when i don't want bare arms. my fear with buying any white shirt is that it will be too sheer. this shirt is sheer but not as much as most, in part due to the pattern that camouflages any sheer-ness. i don't find it to be see through when wearing a nude colored bra that matches my skintone exactly, i've worn it to work with a nude bra, and it was a great transition shirt between the office and happy hour. i went a size up to a small becaus",5
This top is really cute- the plum is a lovely color and the top fits true to size. love the back detailing. and it is really good t-shirt quality.,5
I absolutely adore this top! it is super soft. i purchased it in the wine color. i would recommend this for anyone! if they have other colors i plan on buying them. i am going to wear this with jeans and my furry vest in the fall/winter.,5
"This dress had my attention immediately online, but in person it was even prettier. i would not say the colors are very ""pink"" as the color selection indicates, rather browns (with possible pink undertones) and yellows, and even a splash of dark green in the print here and there. there isn't a ton of give or stretch to the fabric so a larger chest may need to size up. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the size 4 fit just right (though i don't have a ton of extra room in the chest",5
"Love these soft cozy leggings. fit like a glove. perfect for weekends, lounging, sleeping during cold winter weather. want more of the same!",5
I am very happy with this shirt. i don't like skin tight clothes. i bought this top a bit loose but it does not look like i am wearing a sack. it is tunic length on me so i have worn it with jeans and boots. i love the way it flows while i walk. very flattering on. would definitely recommend!,5
"I bought this for our daughter. i tried it on when it arrived and the material is fabulous and feels soooo good against the skin. the purple is a stunning color - very subdued and classy. if she does not like it on christmas after gifts are opened, guess who is going to keep it for herself! if she loves it as much as i think she will, then i'll just have to get one for myself. the pleats in the back are very flattering. best of all is the fabric. it is luxurious. thank you retailer for yet another",5
"Amazing! they are like those cozy, wool socks. they are true to size. they don't stretch out (at least yet), even after i stretched, etc . i am going to get another pair since i envision wearing these often in the cold house.",5
"Very pleased with this top. i got the blue and white first and now i'm getting the red and white. the material is comfy and not sheer, and the slits at the side and the zipper in back add extra style.",5
"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer, please get the fit right!!",1
"I love this comfy top, and if it couldn't get any better, the pleated back makes it extra special! it is easy to thrown on and still feel put together. i purchased this top in the green and i'm absolutely enthralled by the rich color! i do agree that the quality of the pleats could be slightly better, however i believe it's up to par with the price point. i typically wear an xs/xsp and ultimately decided to go with a small for a more oversized tunic top look, but otherwise i'd go for your normal",5
I love this top! i think the knit rib quality is quite lovely and the color is gorgeous. i bought the plum color and got many compliments while wearing it. i like that it's a little on the longer side. i wore it with my pull-on ponte pants and booties. very cute!!,5
"Never want to take this tee off, so comfy, & neutral, ecru stripe, with a teeny bit sparklecolor is superb! goes with a ton of items from my own closets! need more in every color/print/stripe......just feels ooh, soooo good",5
"I bought the black one on an extra 40% off sale and i just love it! not thrilled about the other colors, but i might order another one just because i like it so much. super soft and comfy. i had to order a size up since the mediums were all sold out, but i like the way it fits. not too big at all.",5
"This is a great layering piece. got in orange color and it is really a beautiful shade. i am 5'3"" 36dd and went with a m. very flowy, nice length (more on the short side), and not see through. i am able to wear without a bra, where the ruffles cover any possible chance of seeing anything ;). i have a black came from another brand and have literally worn it to pieces. goes well under a jacket for work, a kimono, wrap, denim jacket, just anything! i was a bit disappointed it is ""dry clean only"", h",5
"If you're a curvy girl like me this shirt is very flattering. hangs nicely in the front, not too clingy. also has that accordian back which is very nice because it hides my back fat. the plum is gorgeous! was king it for the first time so can't yet comment on how it holds up with washing or whether the back retains its accordian loom with the hang to dry recommendation.",5
"Love the color of this shirt! i wear it under a brown leather jacket i purchased, in store!",5
These legging are adorable. i love that i was able to get them in a petite size and the detailing of these pants are awesome. the buttons at the ankle are cute. i truly feel these leggings are worth the price i paid for them because normally i don't like to spend so much on leggings.,5
"This dress is beautifully made, but it does not flair slightly as in the photo, it stick out like a tent. it might be a good maternity dress. the fabric is somewhat stiff andheavy with a slight texture.",1
I love this shirt and the colors it brings out. this shirt makes a great statement. it can be worn with jeans and look great or worn with slacks. i great a lot of compliments.,5
"I was extremely disappointed when this arrived. it's nothing like the red color shown, rather it's a very dull reddish color. as other reviews have suggested, it is very thin and runs large. i have to return.",1
This fits a little short on me and i'll have to wear a shirt underneath even with a high waist pant. i still adore it! get it for the price!,5
Very nice long-sleeved shirt. the fabric is soft and warm. you can wear it on its own or easily compliment with a jacket.,5
Love it - material is soft and color goes will with any color.,5
"I couldn't be happier with this top. it is very flattering and not at all shapeless as suggested by another reviewer...least not on me. yes the materiel is somewhat thin but it is advertised to be a tee shirt type material. that is why it feels so comfortable on with nice stretch and softness . i love the pleated back giving it neat detail and a added feminine touch. i ordered the dark purple color and it looks just like in the photo.
thanks retailer!!!!",5
This blouse fits true to size. i carry alot of weight in my mid section and this blouse easily covers and hides my mid section where i'm not having to tug or pull down. i have this blouse in the olive green in xl and it fits perfect. i wore this on christmas with my family.,5
"This color is really cool because it can go with black, grey, or tan shoes. the back pleats are unique and do not add bulk. the back is also lined, so you don't need a tank. fits tts and i thought it was fairly flattering. on sale, this is a great deal.",5
"This dress is very versatile - it will be cool and comfortable in the summer, but one could also wear it with leggings or skinny jeans in the winter with a sweater or jacket. it can be worn casually with a belt, or dressed up with a statement necklace and earrings for a night out. the black color is more like a charcoal grey, which suits me fine. grab it while you can - it's a good deal for the current sale on sale price!",5
"I loved the delicate and feminine print of this blouse at first sight. the fit was perfect - just enough room to be flattering and comfortable, without adding any unnecessary bulk. the style and print could even be paired with a more classic skirt and pumps and go to the office. the length was also spot-on - it's not too long to be a tunic, yet long enough to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings on an errand-running day. the blouse is very lightweight and sheer, making it that much more comfo",5
"My husband bought me this set for christmas and it was hands down my favorite gift. these leggings, let me tell you about these leggings!! so comfortable, so cute (buttons/color/pattern), love they way they feel on my legs. as soon as i get home from work i put them on (well, a lot of days). i am ordering another pair. i am someone who doesn't do leggings. i would go as far as saying that this lounge set actually makes me feel sexy, that's how much i love them.",5
"I looked at this top online & thought abt wearing w/ shorts (later) & saw that it's cotton which i love. decided to order my usual size small in the black & the moss. arrived yesterday... happened to have on a pair of leggings & tried on the tops. wow, really cute w/ leggings... looks like i can wear w/ skinnys, shorts, or leggings so i'm happy w/ that. may even go w/ a skirt or slacks.
the cap sleeves are cute & the top flares some but not over-whelming or maternity-like. plenty of room on my s",5
"When i saw this skirt on line, i wasn't impressed--especially at the price. but then i saw it in the store and i had to have it! it's beautiful. definitely a colder weather skirt due to the nice weight of the fabric. the colors are lovely and subtle, with a little sheen, ensuring you can wear it with many tops and for many occasions, from everyday to dressier. length is just at the bottom of the knee for me (5'7""), with a flattering and comfortable cut.",5
Purchased for myself and loved the fabric and unique design. it runs very large and the size smaller was not available so it was returned.,5
"Fit is true to size, color is accurate. love the feel of the knit, it's weightier than if anticipated. i'm looking forward to wearing this to my pnw trips.",5
"I tried this dress on in the store. i loved the fabric and color, but the fit was huge, no matter how much i sized down. there are full dresses and tunics that are supposed to be loose, but this was shapeless in an unflattering way. i was attracted to the style and color, but the execution left much to be desired.",1
This is such a great addition to my fall wardrobe. this is so cute! i'm 5'9 and this fits perfectly. i don't usually do well with some of the cropped pieces but this one has such a complementary cute. the sleeves are just the right length. i've had lots and lots of complements on this one! it's a keeper!,5
"This sweater is warm and cozy. it has flattering lines the way it closes, the banded detail at the hem and sleeve details. please remember it is wool so right next to your skin my be itchy. however it is the best sweater for a slim flattering warm look.",5
"I love this jacket and always get compliments when i wear it. i have the green version, and the color is lovely. the sleeves are the perfect length ( i got a petite size) and it is very flattering. the jacket is not warm enough for a really windy, snowy day, but is perfect for cool fall days.",5
"I just purchased this sweater, but have not worn it yet as it is still very hot in the va/dc area. the print is super cute in person. it reminds me of a missoni knit pattern. the color is described as gray motif, but it's really more greens and browns, very fall colors. the sweater is soft and comfortable. the knit is fine, not chunky and doesn't add bulk. it is fitted through the chest with an empire waist and flowing over your stomach and hip area; wonderfully forgiving of any extra bulges you",5
"My preference is clothing made of natural fibers, but i couldn't resist trying this on once i felt it! the cut-out pattern in the fabric, the color,  the buttons & the design of the back all add to make a dress i'm going to wear with leather flip-flops during the day or wedges & a denim jacket at night. it's perfect for southern california fall (& likely much of winter this year) weather. i'm a 32d (& won't need/wear a bra) & although i usually wear a 6, i bought a 4. maeve, i like your style!",5
"Very cute, great fit and super comfortable. perfect for fall with tall boots",5
I was worried this skirt might look too much like a bedspread. but it is so gorgeous on and the cut is so flattering. i ordered a petite small and it fits perfectly. great fall/winter skirt.,5
"I trired this one and lvoed it right away. the cut is flattering, but the sleeves are a little long so ordering petite. the red color is like a wine color, very nice. i also ordered green to see the color in person, i am not sure which i will keep. can be worn with anything, really: jeans, pants or skirts or dresses...",5
"This sweater is so well made and uniquely designed. one of the main reasons i love retailer is for how toy make wool sweaters, timeless, affordable, and versatile.

worth the money!",5
"This is a simple design, but feminine and dressy enough for a summer wedding.  this dress is great for hourglass shapes, but it does not hide your features.",5
Love the dress but ended up returning it as i'm not sure how often i would wear it. the only down fall is the dress is straight so you have to take smaller steps but stunning dress!!!,5
"I wore this top recently and received several compliments. it's a great top with the off the shoulder trend, plus you can wear a normal bra underneath! runs large so i recommend one size down.",5
"One in every fifteen items of retailer clothing fits. this jacket is one. easy to grab and keep chill away. hood snuggles up as cozy collar when not worn up. model in photo must have orangutan arms, sleeves hit at wrist on this wearer with shortish arms.

boiled wool fabric is light, which is great for layering. lovely transition fall to winter transition piece. statement jacket that will live on next season and beyond.

thank you, rosie neira.",5
"When i tried on this dress my husband's jaw dropped to the ground. it is so unique and so beautiful on. however the cut of the fabric fit oddly on me so i am exchanging for a small with fingers crossed. i am a size 6, 5'8"" and the medium just felt a little boxy over the middle section. my six year old son said that it was the most beautiful dress he had ever seen. buy this!",5
"I saw this dress online and fell in love with it. it is just as beautiful in person too. very delicate, but receive so many compliments every time i wear. it is two separate pieces, a slip dress and the overlying fringe dress. i am 5'4"" and need a 2 inch wedge heel to keep the bottom from dragging. probably could have tried to order the petite but figured i'd probably be wearing heals anyway. i normally wear a 6/8 in dresses and the medium fit perfectly and is so flattering! the top half is flow",5
"I am 5'1"" and 120lb with curves and muscles. i am tiny and slim but i have t & a in spades, a 34c and a bubble but. that said. this dress made me look tall and lithe. i took the xs petite because the xs the fringe was too long on the bottom. there is plenty of blouse on the top to accommodate the ""girls"" and you can pull the dress up or down to make it more blousy or more of a fitted column dress, to your preference. it's more of an antique ivory color and beautiful with gold or silver sandals.",5
I had to have this jacket! looks much better in person. i bought the navy color. the fit is great. it has a flowy bottom and is unstructured. i wear a dark navy t shirt or cami underneath. great with jeans and over the knee boots or booties. its a bit heavy and bulky to wear under a coat.,5
I almost didn't try this dress. i walked by it a few times and am so glad i gave it a try! the fit is amazing. so flattering. the color and material for fall is perfect. it looks great with booties and heels.,5
"I bought this online in dark green after trying on the burgundy. i usually wear a medium (5'2"", 120) but i looked better in the small in this jacket. the combination of very deep green, black and tan is beautiful. the cut is very flattering with the jacket open or snapped closed. it is nice enough to wear with black pants or skirt but looks just as good with jeans. i am in my 60's and this look is chic and fresh without being too ""young"" for my age. it's also very well made. i love it.",5
"Beautiful dress. flowing but not too much volume, not too short but not dowdy, gorgeous deep jade color with chartreuse accents, flattering waist (not sure why the model is covering that part up, but it's a nice waist with a tie belt). i think it looks really smashing in person. not too formal, perfect for a daytime event like a bridal shower.",5
What a cute swing sweater and so easy to layer. this jacket looks great snapped or left open and the collar and hood leave such a soft look around your neck. this has such great elements of cozy and warmth just in time for cool weather!,5
"This dress is amazing! the color is a little darker then what's pictured, but the dress is great. very delicate. you have to be careful how you handle it.",5
"I bought this with the intention of taking it on a very warm trip - and i think it'll do just fine! it's a wonderful open-gauge knit - delicate and light, but substantial enough that i don't fear snagging it constantly. the cloth has a nice weight and drape, and while the fit is on the loose side, it does look intentional. wonderful as a pullover or by itself. i have the minty blue-green color, and it's divine. definitely worth the price.",5
"5ft 6inches
135lbs
short waisted, small bust (30dd)
 the color is more watermelon pink than that slightly orangey tone that's shown on the website. i  ordered a six petite because i wanted it to be kneelength. the four petite also fit, but was a little constricted in the bust. the dress is weightless--100% silk! i agree with the other reviewer about the bust of this dress --it's probably not great for large chests because of the ruffles",5
"I love this jacket. something to get cozy in on cool california winter nights, and still light enough to wear open and walk around without getting too hot. i am 5'3' and have a medium frame but 34 dd on top. i bought a medium because i hate things to be tight around my chest, and this is perfect. my only disappointment is that i wish it had pockets. i got the wine color and it is very beautiful. wonderful, unique and comfortable jacket. i do recommend it.",5
"This is a beautiful sweater . it's very lightweight and sheer, so best to wear a tank or camisole underneath. also better for warmer months. i ordered the light aqua color and it's lovely.",5
"I had high hopes for this sweater and when i found it on sale online, i jumped at the opportunity. i am 5'11"", slender and always wear a small in retailer tops. i purchased this in the mint , size small and as soon as i opened the bag, i had doubts. the fabric is terrible, thin and scratchy. it is not soft and supple as i had imagined. the mint color looks faded and the shape is awful. the length of the arms hits in a bizarre spot, the overall length of the sweater cuts me off at the torso and the",1
I sized down in this and it fit perfectly! i normally opt for petite in skirts but i stuck to regular for this skirt and it was much more flattering . adorable and well made!,5
"Great dress, true to size....wore it to dinner one night while in a beach vacation friends, got tons of compliments! you have to be careful when putting it on, as it may snag! otherwise, highly recommended!!",5
"Perfect for work or a night out. packing for europe, wore it out on a saturday night with leggings and heels. layer it after yoga got it in all colors love",5
"The red of the cape is a deep garnet. really pretty with the beige lining. it's loose enough that it feels and flows differently than a sweater. the boiled wool isn't itchy but keeps you warm on a fall day. the one snap lets you easily take it on and off. i'm 5'5"" and 125lbs. the xs fit perfectly without being too tight. i've gotten a lot of compliments on it.",5
"I just got this dress and am so excited to have it hanging in my closet, i've been eyeing it for a long time and am glad i got it on sale. i felt like a greek goddess when i tried this on and cannot wait to wear it. it fits like it was made just for me. the outer material is a little heavier than expected but it not a problem, the second layer is form fitting and soft. i feel like the restricted opening at the bottom forces me to slow down, like a lady and take in my surroundings, after all life",5
"So this is available in the store in a reddish coral color, see the #your retailer pictures and you'll see someone wearing it under the gray blazer. anyway, i tried it on and the fit was very flattering for a tunic. the front of the sweater hit me just at the waist and the front draped nicely. somehow the back was slightly hugging my back side but not tight or restricted. i ended up ordering the black and navy online because the fit was fantastic and will go with so many things. nothing shee",5
"This is the most comfortable, sweet, beautiful, romantic and timeless dress. i bought the green motif one is sz 14 and it fits perfectly. i am smaller chested (usually a 12/medium/large up top depending on the item) and a sz 14/xl/33 for pants so perhaps this dress runs one size small? the color in the detail shot is most accurate - it's bright & cheerful and dreamy.",5
"I loved the look of this dress the moment i saw it but was ridiculously long. at 5""3 i can usually get away with buying regular length longer dresses and pants with the help of heels if needed but not a chance this time. this dress does not come in petite and the fringed bottom design of the dress would not allow for any type of altering either.",5
This is a great fall boho dress. you can dress up or down depending on the shoes. looks great with boots! but definitely size down!!,5
I just bought this and tried it on on a whim and am so happy i did! it's so much more flattering on than this photo depicts. i think it'll be one of my summer staples this year! give it a try!,5
"I tried this in the store a few weeks ago when it just came out because i loved the neutral design and look of it and came back the following week to purchase it with my discount code because it really is worth it...
_______
pros:
- true a-line silhouette. if you have curves and hips like i do (5'9, 36c, hourglass, 165 lbs), then this skirt will flatter you completely. there's a lovely swing to the dress and it drapes wonderfully because it's a thicker fabric.
- runs tts. i can normally wear",5
"Oh how i love this dress! i was pleasantly surprised at the texture of the fabric, it is a wonderful feel of cotton and not that poly that sticks to your fingers. it fits like a dream...true to size...romantic and flirty...i can see this with cowboy boots and hat as well as with evening sandals...the possibilities are limitless. i am so happy i was finally able to snag one up as a return because it sold out. just love it! i also plan to wear it in the fall with a jean jacket. it is a winter whit",5
"I don't care because i like be it so much; but, make no mistake, it is not black but rather a dark navy. however please don't let this fall negatively on your decision to buy it. it's fabulous!",5
"This sweater is the best sweater to throw on over a buttoned blouse, t-shirts, long sleeves, tanks. i always get comments on how comfortable and adorable this sweater is. a worthwhile buy.",5
"If you know one.september and you know what's good for you, then size the heck down. maybe even two sizes if your particularly slim or want the dress to fit tighter. any way, this dress is simply scrumptious! the embroidery at the bodice is so detailed and pretty. the layers are light and soft like silk (but it's rayon/poly) and the sleeves are sheer and voluminous. i actually prefer the sleeves rolled up because they are too long. neckline features a slit-v with two hooks to close if wanted. co",5
This jacket is sweet and swingy and showing an early sixties vibe that i adore. a bit cropped and wide so definitely size down so your proportions don't look off. i took my medium and it was way too wide and unflattering so i switched to a sp. looks and feels great with layers.,5
"This sweater totally caught my eye online and when it arrived, it was even better than on the website. gorgeous colors---kind of a retro look, but more modern and updated. very happy with my purchase!",5
"Such a pretty skirt. i think it's a very versatile piece. a bit heavier, can't wait to wear when it cools down more. i saw the dress that is similar to the skirt in the catalog last month and loved it too. note the skirt does not have the same shine in the fabric that the dress does.",5
"This is one of my new favorite dresses!! i ordered this in pink, and think it looks even more gorgeous in person that it does on the model. it's more of a reddish color. the dress hugs my body in a flattering way. i'm a 34b and the dress fits very comfortably, but it might be a tight fit for someone with a larger bust. i'm usually a small for retailer dresses and the small fit like a glove. it is wonderfully flowy and extremely elegant. i can't wait to wear this out!!",5
"This dress can be flattering on any figure type - but especially for women who need a little curve. i always wear a 6 in hd, and this fits nice and snug around the middle with a becoming flirty skirt that is lower in the back than front. flat chested women will have to fill it out with a padded bra. it may not be a great cut for a short person, as it has a long line to it and lots of busy-ness. only drawback, which depends on your taste, is the yellow pattern - it's a weird kind of greeny yellow",5
"This was such an impulse buy- i bought it online during a sweater sale- and i am so glad i did! this is definitely one of my favorite recent purchases. it definitely seems more like a coat than a sweater, but it is lightweight. i ordered the red and it is beautiful. it looks great buttoned or left open and i think this could be dressed up or down (though it does have a hood, so that gives it a slightly more casual feel). it fits true to size- and it is definitely shorter in the front than the ba",5
"Tried on a size 2 regular and it fit well, felt incredibly soft and airy, and is handwashable. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 or 38, with narrow shoulders and torso, somewhat long-waisted but petite from bust to shoulders. i often wear a size 0p or 0 in retailer dresses and tops. the arm holes were a tiny bit low, but not terrible. a petite would have been shorter, but also more of an empire waist. the pink really is more of a red like the online photo; great color.",5
I love the fabric and design of this dress. you will definitely get noticed. and it's comfortable - just slip it on and go!,5
"Love this skirt. purchased it in a 0 and it fit fairly good. sat high up on the waist, which i like. however, now that i have worn it i should have ordered it in a 2. i think the 2 would have let it sit further down making it not so short. i do recommend this skirt but i would order both your regular size and one size up (0 is my typical size in full skirts).",5
"But i have no idea where i would wear this dress... i tried on the size 2 in store, someone had returned it, but i always loved the cut and color of this dress (been in my wish list) so i tried it on anyway. it is so lovely, the cut is super flattering, the bow on the chest is beautiful, and the colors are much nicer in person, pinker. the feel is a bit satin0like, soft. i would need the 0 as it was a bit wide on the chest, but not a petite - surprisingly (usually do need petite in dresses).

"I ordered this jacket to complement the larkin dress by moulinette soeurs, which i planned to wear to a funeral. the pair together were perfect. the jacket added just the right touch in fashion and practical warmth on a sunny but chilly february morning in alexandria, va. i ordered my usual size and it fit perfectly, if not a tad bit large. but then i'm not very tall so occasionally items have more material than i need. but i never worry about that since it doesn't usually affect the lines of th",5
"Ordered online, hedging my bets on size (chose xs/s) because i have broad shoulders and muscular arms and wear anything from 2-8 sizes depending on brand. my gamble paid off - it&#39;s a beautiful sweater. soft, comfortable, nice drape.

(i suspect that finer-boned more petite customers might complain of swimming in this, but it worked well for me!)",5
"I love this skirt. maybe i love wrap skirts in general, but many miss the mark. this one is just right. it does not have elastic waist band which always makes me look frumpy, instead it is a side zip and allows for the tummy to stay flat as well as the pleats. the embroidery is just enough and you may not be able to see the design of black on black in the fabric which makes the skirt. i usually wear a size 6 but the 8 fit just right, so you may want to size up.",5
"I was so happy to discover that my size (00 petite) had suddenly become available again online--probably someone's return. and i wasn't disappointed when i tried the tunic on--it fit great (unlike other recent online purchases from retailer.) love the plaid and the style. the cut should flatter many body types. definitely worth the money!

please, retailer, expand your inventory in petite sizes. the cute stuff sells out so quickly.",5
"Saw this tunic on line and loved the color combo. tried it on at the store and found it to be true to size for me - i'm a 34 dd, 5 ft 4 and the regular size 10 fit fine. i was curious to see if the petite size would fit best with the loops for the tie belt being a little higher, but none were available. still the regular 10 works well. excited to wear when the weather gets warmer like the model with white skinny or cropped jeans, and wearing it open as a duster with a tank or cami. seems very ve",5
"I love tunics and the colors of this one is what caught my eye. overall, the tunic is nice but i have to agree with another review that the stitching at the top of the slits is not good. i also agree that the slits are to high. they should have made them stop at a lower point. it gives an odd effect. the tunic looks good especially with tights. it is tts and i believe the top probably looks better on someone tall because the length of it is so long compared to other tunics.",5
Love the versatility of this dress. looks better in person!,5
"This is the perfect lounge/sleep cami! i am 5'1'' 120 lbs and purchased the dark purple small. it's hangs a bit loose - my preferred fit for sleeping shirts. good quality, easy washing (machine/delicate), and cool and airy for hot summer nights.",5
This is a wonderful style.,5
It's a bit baggy (i'm normally a 6/8 medium but went with the small here). i debated for a while but finally went for it on sale and i'm so glad. the colors are just gorgeous in person. delicate stitching on the shoulders adds a feminine touch. great with my jean jacket which gathers up the extra material just right. looks great with summer sandals and booties for fall. i love love love this dress!,5
"This is that one special, whimsical beauty that you hope to open on christmas morning. super comfy, not at all itchy and the pattern and colors are super stunning. even more vivid in person. i've never seen anything quite like it! very eye catching and oozing for compliments. can be dressed up or down, quite easily. very warm, and surprisingly true to size, even with the m/l combo. i'd say definitely worth the price..it is expensive, but this heirloom worthy piece is worth the splurge.",5
"I love the color combo, and the design make me feel tall and thin. i know this is going to be very cool to wear on a hot day. i like it with my white jeans, and you can wear it a number of ways. i love this brand, i still wear the plaid from last spring. it's a got to have.",5
Very comfortable. fits true to size. i also have this in white. fits snug in the top but hangs loose around the waist making it very comfortable. shirt is very flattering. the polka dots add a playful touch. super cute.,5
In person the colors are prettier and it's more interesting than the front shot in the model. i tried on and bought my regular medium. got home and tried it on and realized it's too big:(,5
"I got these jeans on sale and have been very happy with them. they seem to go with everything - just a really nice basic skinny jean to have. lightweight with a little bit of give. they fit tts for me, and hit about an inch and a half longer on my legs than the model in the picture (i'm 5'6""). i've had them for a couple of months now and keep expecting them to show some wear in the knees bc of how often i wear them. not yet! any marks on them have come off easily in the wash. overall, very happy",5
"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality, cut, and softness of this dress. it can be dressed up or down, with or without leggings/tights, and is cute with boots or flats. my only complaint is that the sleeves are not near as long as what is shown in the photo. i'd say more like 3/4 sleeves. thankfully there is elastic at the cuffs, so the sleeves can be pushed up, and the the material can slightly drape over the elastic.",5
Love this jacket. it fits very well and is super comfortable. you can wear it to work or on the weekends. super versatile!,5
"The neckline is beautiful, whether pulled forward or slipping back. the pure merino knit is very fine with the two front panels cut on the bias. raglan sleeves with high armholes. it is a tiny bit itchy, and normally i'm not too sensitive, but that may improve with a handwash in eucalan or something similar.

fit for size xs on 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 (30d or 32c bra) with narrow shoulders and torso:
snug at the shoulders, but as it is a pure merino knit, it does stretch. the front length just",5
"When i was purchasing this i asked to myself ""do i really need another black jacket"". when it arrived i realized that this is not just another black jacket. this jacket is special. it is light weight - but structured. it is the perfect length and the fabric feels amazing. this jacket is my new favorite.",5
"I love this shirt! it is so soft and a bit see through, so recommend wearing a camisole underneath. perfect with jeans! the fit is slightly boxy, but works well.",5
Stylish and super comfy. even though it's a relaxed oversize fit it is still very flattering and pretty. i dressed it up with cool jeans and my fave free suede boots. my only complaint is that it is not available in more colors. pretty please make more color variations : ),5
"So pretty. 5'4"" 115 lbs and the xs fits perfectly.",5
"These pants were a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! the fun print and texture add interest, but at the same time, are not too busy. they seem well-made, and they have a slim and flattering fit. the side zipper is also a nice touch. i would definitely recommend this item.",5
I saw this suit in the store and was immediately drawn to it. i did not think it was gonna work because i have boobs (real ones) and i was not sure it would provide enough support. it is the cutest suit ever. have enough support to get away with it but definitely couldn't go for a jog. ha. it will also look great with white jeans and double as a bodysuit.,5
"If you like loose flowing tops, embroidery, and fluttery sleeves, you'll adore this top! i went a size down and it's a perfect fit.",5
"These pants are so comfy, well-fitting and flattering. i will order the same style in more colors and patterns because i can tell this will be my uniform this summer. true to size if you like a close fit like i do. size up if you like a loose fit. length is shorter than capri--more like a 1950s pedal pusher. cute.",5
"This top is beautiful and unique, but also i predict it will be high maintenance with the sleeves -- definitely have to be careful with the delicate sleeves.",5
"I love these shorts!!! they are thin lightweight and not see through. however the reviews are correct. i am usually a size 2 or 4 in shorts. i am 5'1"" 112 pounds and i had to size up to 6.. i was able to zip the shorts up but the fit wa a little tight. the 6 offered me the comfort of more room.. overall nice shorts..",5
"Like the previous review said, i was excited to receive this top. i had grand visions of all the ways i could wear it! to my chagrin, when i put it on, it just fell right down and pooled around my waist. i wish there were smaller sizes to order. sadly, this is going back.",1
"I agree with another reviewer that these are not ankle jeans. however, even as regular jeans they fit great and the color is lovely and very versatile. i normally need to have my jeans hemmed but the length on these is perfect for my 5'4 frame",5
"I bought about 20 dresses online in an attempt to find a few dresses for derby week in kentucky.  this was one of the 2 that made the cut. i'm usually a 6, and i bought a 6. it fit like it was tailor made for me. i questioned if it was too tight at first, but decided it was just right and felt great in it for a full day at the track. it was comfy. it almost felt like it had built in spanx. i didn't have to wear a bra and it gave me great lift, almost like a bustier. i got so many compliments, mu",5
"If you have a love for vintage, romantic, feminine attire, this is the dress for you. it evokes memory of days gone by. it isn't just beautiful, the quality is superb. make sure you check the measurements for this little beauty has so stretch to it.",5
"I absoluty love this dress! it hugs in all the right places, giving a sexy yet very classy look, very much a ""mad men"" look. the quality is fantastic and could easily pass for a vintage dress that has been kept safely preserved. i would recomend every lady has one of these in her closet, especially when you need to feel just a little bit prettier!",5
"I ordered the mauve in size xl and it fits true to size. it matched the photos online. all of the details are prettier in person. it's delicate. but, it's washed/dried well. very pretty shade of mauve.",5
"It was bit on pricey side but it was love at first sight! i couldn't let go after i tried it on..it is soft, lightweight, moves with me, keeps me warm (not just from top up)..it feels silky to the touch and is very versatile and stylish..

runs true to size and it expands a bit the more you wear it ...",5
"I love to shop at retailer for tops that i can wear everyday. they always seem to have pieces that are comfortable, casual, and quite different from what you would find in most stores. this top is exactly that! it fits true to size and is washable. all you need are jeans, boots and a neutral necklace and you are good to go. you can't go wrong if you purchase this top!",5
"I loved this the minute i saw it in the store but left without buying it.  i called the store an hour later and asked them to hold it for me so i could get it the next day. :)

i love it.  it's still a little too warm to wear it in nyc yet but i will soon. i'm thinking 40-50's is the perfect temps for it.  

i rarely say this but i don't think the photos of the coat above do it justice.",5
Worth every single penny. size up - they are very tight!,5
"I like that you can dress this shirt up or down. go out, or lounge in it! very comfortable and i would recommend buying it.",5
I just bought this today so i can't say whether or not it will wear well but i think it will. i love it bc it's different and super comfy but also stylish. i know that when i wear this other people won't have it on. i think it looks better in person than on this model in picture.,5
"Love these vintage soft jeans.. they do run small so be sure get a size larger.. i am typically a 27 and i ordered a 28... look amazing with boots, flip flops and slip ons... love mother jeans.. work every time",5
"The buttons on the back are very tedious. you will need someone to help you. if you get past that hurdle, then you have the look of a little girl in a smock. way too big. like a nightgown. nice quality, but not practical.",1
Warning-- it's totally sheer so you will need to wear a tank under it or unless you're very confident in your mid-section you can wear a bandeau or just a bra. it's definitely a lounge/ leisure wear piece and great for layering if you want to wear it out. it's lightweight and perfect layer over a simple dress or top. i live in this over the weekends. i am a larger gal-- broader shoulder and purchased an xl. it's true to size and roomy.,5
"Fits true to size, soft material and unique look. the sleeves and overall cut of this shirt are flattering. i was worried it might look boxy or baggy but it didn't at all. the dark gray is a gorgeous color and can be dressed up or down. definitely going to be a staple in my closet.",5
Beautiful sweatshirt top that can be worn to work.,5
"This is very cute. it's lined, it's smocked. it's longer on me than the model in the picture. i was a bit concerned about the short length but the skirt actually came to just above my knees, which works well for me. it might run a tad big because it is a pull of skirt. i look forward to wearing this light weight skirt on hot days his summer!!",5
"I love these shorts, nice material, good fitting, and great look. i sized up, usually an 8 and i ordered a 10 based on others reviews and it was the right choice. these are a great casual short or dressed up with shoes and a nice shirt.",5
"I had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i've received this dress i'm appalled by all the positive reviews!!! this dress is hideous in person. seriously hideous. and even if you can get past the drapery fabric, it's incredibly restricting. the picture online is so misleading. the dress isn't even an ivory it's more of a pea green! so disappointed.",1
Love love this sweater/shirt. i have worn it out to dinner and work with leggings. it is soft and comfy. the pleats in the back are beautiful and do not require constant ironing. i even bought it in the pink.,5
These have a great fit & design. i ordered a size larger after reading that this style runs on the small size. typically i'm a 27 but ordered a 28. the wash has a great vintage feel about it! i also love that these do not lose their shape after wearing all day.,5
"I took a chance and ordered this top on sale, even after reading the troublesome reviews. this updated take on the turtleneck is a keeper for me. the purple color is vibrant and the collar lays without repeated fussing. i ordered the xs (116, 5'4"" for reference) and the fit was tts and close to, but not snug on my torso. there is room for a button down blouse underneath (as styled in a gallery pic) and i did not find the sleeves to be problematic, as it fit me close enough to the body to not giv",5
"This coat is awful, just awful. i bought it based on the reviews, my husband said it looks like i am wearing a mattress. it looked awful. i really really liked the softness and that it wasn't like another puffer coat, it was also stretchy and the buttons super easy to wear, but the look, style, and design make it very unflattering. it looked so bad that i took it off right away. so disappointing!",1
"I new i had to have this dress the moment i saw it. i am a recent convert to byron lars and have three dress of his design. they are all 6 or 6p so i felt confident ordering a 6. whoops! this dress fit perfectly up to the waist. it was even a little roomy but i couldn't button it up any further than that. it is a little weird since i always thought i had a narrow ribcage. anyway, i will have to exchange it for an 8p. and hope for the best. it really is an exquisitely beautiful dress and unbeliev",5
"I took this into the dressing room for fun and wow so glad i did! i got the regular m and it fits perfectly. it is very slightly roomy but i think thats the design and it still looks great. as a petite, the regular m fit perfectly - heals or no heals. its comfy and lovely!!!!!",5
"It's a light material so it flows. the shine is just enough to dress up when i need. i'm a 12 and usually buy xl of any t-shirt looking style, but the large fit perfectly. i am however not large breasted.",5
"While contemplating on purchasing these pants. after receiving them, quality was superb, waffle material 5 spandex, beautiful green color, and 2 snaps in the front,  zipper and 2  front and back pockets. material has alot of give and wide legs. these pants don't come to the ankle so don't expect it. sort of like capri but longer, lose fitting and wide legs. nice addition to my closet. i hit the jackpot now and again w/ this store.",5
"This tank/blouse is flowy and i love the design. it was immediately comfortable and seemed true to size. i wore it to a family event with a sweater, black leggings and boots. i'm 5'5,"" 36d and usually wear medium in retailer tops and this fit beautifully from the get go, just love it!",5
I bought both colors thinking i might like one since i wasn't totally sold on colors looking online. well the cut is sooo flattering that i was sold and had to keep both. this shirts are great.,5
This shirt was great for one wear. after just one wash (followed instructions to dry clean) it lost all shape and now hangs like a bed sheet. terrible waste of money on a pricey top.,1
"This tee is s bit on the pricey side but well with it. soft fabric, and unique mix beautiful colors (i got the grey, blush, and gold) that will offer a lot of options on terms of what it can be worn with. i love splendid and this tee is why i do!",5
"I took a chance on this one with free shipping and figured i had nothing to lose. i love it! the bottom hem is slightly flared, but does not look like a maternity tee. i'm going to wear this with a fun scarf, skinnies and colorful flats! this tee is a must!",5
"Love this top! super comfortable, great fit, and really pretty colors. probably going to buy it in multiple colors it fits so great.",5
Not just another striped tee. perfect drape & lightly fitted at the bottom sides so it skims the body & is super flattering. the subtle shimmer is just right. love the gray! very versatile & irresistible. i'm a size 4/small & this is tts.,5
"I'm glad i discovered this super easy to wear, flattering summer dress on a recent store visit. if i had only seen it online, i'm not sure i would have ordered it. i prefer it styled with flat sandals for an effortless boho look. i'm 5'5, slim and small chested and xs fit perfectly.",5
"Looks great on. fits beautifully,",5
"This is really my favorite top! i wear it all the time, like every day. it's so soft, a beautiful rich color (blue), has nice detailing, and so flattering on a hot momma like me who still has a little tummy from my three lovely children. snuck it in to my dressy office on a friday as well - with a conservative skirt and high heels. only downside is the lack of other nice colors. the stripe isn't cutting it. got my regular xs and it fits perfectly.",5
"I was so bummed to see how quickly this top sold out online in the black. however, to my delight, i happened to stumble upon the shirt in my size in my local store recently. knowing it was sold out online, i immediately grabbed it to try on. big mistake: i instantly fell in love. i'm a curvy woman (34d chest, wide hips, small waist and a slight tummy) and this shirt fits beautifully in my usual size (which is a medium in deletta). hugs my figure without making me look big. i work in an office wh",5
"I ordered this top (black) in both small and medium; i can get usually away with small at retailer but am size medium in all other stores. as soon as i received the package and opened it up, i knew i would keep this top. it has a gorgeous texture to it, a slight sheen, and is well made. it's extremely comfortable as a t-shirt would be, but has more structure and looks very chic. the waist nips in just enough to give the flutter hem a little flare at the hips and is very feminine. i have a long tor",5
"I loved the shirt. the fabric was amazing and i loved the way it fit, unfortunately it didn't look good on me. but i would recommend this shirt to anyone who can pull it off the look, i was sad i couldn't.",5
"Love this ripple-front top. fabric is beautiful, love the lining and the fit is perfect. looks great with pants and skirts. i also love the sleeve length. i purchased this in both white and black. great for spring and summer.",5
This top is sold out in my size online but i was fortunate enough to snag one in the store. great top that can be dressed up or down. the ruching across the front is very slimming. tried the top with skirts and pants -- looks great with everything! i usually wear a size small in deletta tops but sized up to a medium to accommodate my chest (i am a full c cup). i highly recommend this purchase.,5
"I was looking for a comfortable top that looks put-together and cute for work, and this one fits the bill. i couldn't decide between black or white ? so i got both! if i had to choose, i would stick with the black, because it's more slimming, particularly for those of us with a large bust. it's not as heavy or stiff of a material as it appears in the pic, which i like, but it still has structure. great basic with some flair. i got the small (my normal retailer size), and it fit perfectly.",5
"This top is just as pretty in person as it is online. i usually buy petites, but ordered this one in the regular length and i'm glad i did. perfect on me at 5'2"". my usual size medium fit great everywhere else too. love their fabric choice as well. i'm getting really tired of the thin cottons and slub jersey materials being used so often now. deletta made my day once again!!!",5
"Love this jacket so much! so comfy and great for traveling. i love the fit and the way it wears,",5
"I am very happy about the jacket. i like the material and the cut. i was able to wear the jacket for a walk on a rather windy day, about 60 f, with a thin sweater underneath, and it felt comfortable. 

the fit is very flattering. i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer (5'7"", 125 lb, got size s). also, i wish the lining was full, not just the front detail - it would allow more versatility. but that's just me...

overall, i like it :))",5
Great jacket. love that the hoodie insert is removable so i can wear just the outer jacket for work.,5
"Love this top, wore it for the first time today and it looks so good. soooo flattering from the front. the back is plain, but ive got some back fat, so i wear a jacket.",5
"I love this blazer! it's so comfortable! i just wonder if the company makes more ""inserts"" in different fabrics/colors? i'd love to be able to change it up a bit.",5
It's a great light jacket for early spring. ideal topper for jeans or denim skirt.,5
"The pictures online do not do this jacket justice. i saw it hanging in the store and had to have it, even before i tried it on. it's extremely versatile, worn as shown, as a layered look, or the zipped ""liner"" is can be removed and this can be worn as a simple blazer. it's the perfect weight for spring/fall. it's fitted, and so cute. this jacket runs true to size (not large). i usually wear a 4 and the small fit perfectly.",5
"This jacket is the best. i'm trying to step up my work wardrobe game while still maintaining some personality and this blazer fits the bill. it's soft, structured, and best part: the hoodie insert is removable. for reference, i'm 5'4"", 128 lbs and the small fit perfectly.",5
This cape is stunning! the perfect addition to any closet. it can be worn to a formal or out to dinner with jeans. the fur is so soft and the quality is superior. it has real fur hooks (four) to close it and the side pockets are adorable. definitely a buy and a bargain on sale!,5
"This is the second dress i buy at retailer this year and this one is spot on!! exactly what i was looking for: feminine, dressy yet can be dressed up or down depending on the circumstance. the fabric in this dress is particularly gorgeous, very comfortable on the skin, very flowy so it doesn't have a ""heavy"" quality to it and the design is amazing with the navy ribbon on the front. i completely fell in love with this dress! this is a little number to keep for many years.",5
Received this top as a gift from a friend with great taste. found fabric to have high quality feel and texture and it fit quite well. love how the flutter layer creates a different look.,5
"This is a nice top! it is dressy and cute, tts. i am 8 or 10 and got a med. would look great with jeans, pencil skirts, slim cut pants. very happy with this purchase.",5
"This is a wonderful one-piece swim suit! it's very flattering on, and the colors and design are just lovely. i also love the suit's vintage feel and that it's sexy without being overly revealing. i seldom pay full price for clothing, but this item is definitely worth every penny!!! i bought a size medium and it fit perfectly.",5
"This is a great shirt for fall. very comfortable and flowy, without making you look dumpy. tried it on in the store, ended up waiting to buy online at the sale price.",5
"I love this top! i'm 5'7'', 135 lb and the small fits well (probably could have fit in the xs). it is more fitted at the top and flowy at the bottom. i ordered it in orange and it is a very pretty peachy coral stripe. highly recommend for a comfy top that can be dressed up a bit more than your average t-shirt.",5
"I fell in love with this on-line and when it arrived today i think i love it even more because the white portion of this sweater is really a medium pink color which looks so chic. although i am not usually into pink, this looks so stylish with the pink instead of the white. this is a piece you might find in a vintage store in the village in nyc. can't wait for it to get chilly so i can wear it. for reference, i am 5'1, 36c chest and the small fit perfect. the quality is really high end as well.",5
"Love this top and wish they had more colors in xs, but the sale was too good so they were sold out. i'm 5'10"" 140 lbs, an xs fits great. will go with jeans or leggings.",5
"This top is a great, versatile long sleeved shirt. i'm 5'10"" and the sleeves were long for me, so i don't know why it's listed as 3/4 length. i could see where sleeve length would be a problem for more petite ladies. the wine color is beautiful. it is slightly more fitted than the picture, i was afraid it might be semi-sheer, but its totally fine. i wish it was a bit longer in the torso, but it's not short like some sweaters this season. i do tend to have a shorter torso, so a tall lady with a l",5
"I ordered this blazer so i could look more put-together for work, but still feel comfortable. it checks both of those boxes, (it's almost like a sweatshirt material with more structure) and has a great cut/style. my only word of caution is that i thought this jacket was white with blue stripes, but the white part is actually a light heathered gray. i think i would have preferred white, but i still like it enough to keep. got my normal size small, which fit great.",5
I love this top. it is comfortable and different from other tops in my closet!,5
"I bought this shirt at the store and after going home and trying it on, i promptly went online and ordered two more! i've gotten multiple compliments anytime i wear any of them. great for looking put together with no fuss. 
people that have commented there's were destroyed in the wash didn't read the care label which says dry clean.",5
I run between an xs and s in most retailer shirts. i went with the xs in this one and was glad i did. the fit is lovely and flattering. i loved this shirt the second i put it on -- then went to order it in another color.,5
"I love this top and wear it all the time. it's a gorgeous pale blue and feels amazing....it is a tighter fitting shirt so if you like looser clothes, size up",5
"Great top! a little large, but i shrank it a little in the wash, and it fits a little better now. i love the structure and pattern of this top, as well as the lovely coral/orange color. it can be dressed up or dressed down! love it!",5
"Great layering top. so comfy, feels soft as my pjs. bought it in 3 colors.",5
I loved the shirt until i washed it! awful fabric quality. cheaply made.,1
"I tried this dress on in the store and loved it. it's unfortunately out my price range but if i could have afforded it, i would have bought it. i'm about 5'10"" and the length of the size 2 was perfect. sexy back and great color.",5
"It's hard purchasing clothes online. i was hesitant on this shirt wondering about the size and that it might be too plain or boring. when i received it i was pleasantly surprised as its texture adds a nice bit of upscale to this basic tee. if your debating on whether to choose a larger or smaller size, i went with the smaller size as its a looser style and fits perfect.",5
"This jacket has great style, is really comfortable, and looks good with jeans or nice pants. i usually wear a small or extra small in all clothes but thought the arms were tight in the small. the medium is a better fit.",5
"This dress is lovely. i tried it in the red and the black. decided to keep the red, as i have so much black. going to wear to a spring wedding - i will feel so comfortable and appropriate! just looking for a great statement necklace!",5
Tts and very feminine and flattering. looks same as on model. love this style. if you like style highly recommend . armholes not too big- yay!,5
"This shirt is structured enough to wear to work and flirty enough to wear out on the town. the details around the neck and the bottom make it very unique. i paired it with a chunky necklace and got tons of compliments. however, i could imagine this shirt may not work for those with a bigger bust line as there isn't much give in that area.",5
"In my opinion, the quality and uniqueness of this piece far definitely warrants a full price purchase. adorable cut and style, comfortable and cute. it's the perfect flexible top to wear to work with a skirt or more casually with your favorite pair of jeans. love this!",5
"Love this top! it has a beautiful appliquã© that is reminiscent of many past retailer favorites. it's comfy, yet cute and fashionable.",5
"I love this tunic. i am typically an xxs petite, so i should have known that the regular xs would be too large, but i took a chance on it. unfortunately it was, in fact, much too large. it is too bad because i absolutely love it. the fabric is soooo soft and comfy. i ordered it in the blue, and it is prettier than pictured. this is a great dress for the beach or pool-side or just knocking around. if you live in a hot climate or take warm-weather vacations, i highly recommend this. it takes up ve",5
"This top is very cute and appears in person just as it does in the picture. fits true to size and the item is made well. i had many complements and it was fun to wear!

unfortunately, i did have to iron it right out of the bag.",5
"I'm 5'0, 125 lbs, and 34d, i ordered a 6p and it fits perfectly. the color is more of a bronze mixed with gold and chocolate. the picture does not do it justice.",5
I ordered a size smaller prr other reviewers but that still didn't prepare me for the sweater's issues. it looks really cute but the quality is pretty horrendous. i wore it for the first time today and already the sweater is pilling a lot on my back. seriously heartbroken.,1
"I love this dress. the fit is spectacular and if there were any problems with the hook and eyes in the front coming undone as stated in previous reviews, it has been corrected! the dress does not come undone and it moves beautifully with you walking, sitting and bending. i wore this to a holiday party and the color is just amazing! a coppery and brown/gold pattern. very flattering! i will purchase more byron lars dresses for certain!",5
"Great top. i ordered online because i needed a white top that i could get away with wearing in fall to work (even though it's white). i'm ""busty"" and normally shirts like this make me look gigantic (like i'm going to tip over) but this was a very flattering cut and fit. i highly recommend. it was also comfortable and i wore it with blue slacks to work (the flower is partially dark blue). i'm 5'8"" and the length was perfect. not too long in the butt but enough to cover it subtly.",5
"I just got this in the mail, absolutely gorgeous. the hook and eye closure is very secure, i have no problem walking or sitting in this dress. i ordered a aize 8 going by the previous reviews that this dress ran small, i could have ordered my normal 6, but the 8 fits pretty good,just a tad big. the dress is more chocolate brown than black and the detail is really stunning!! you can't find unique dresses like this anymore, truly beautiful!!",5
Love my new top! i wear it casually with skinny navy pants and dressed up with new wide leg winter white pants! it's funky style garnered lots of compliments. as a mother of two teens i love to dress cute and appropriate. it really pairs well with so much and the bold flower makes it stand out!,5
"Fits like a glove and looks amazing on. it fits so many different body types but yet is flattering in all the right places! i got 00p and have a smaller chest and hip but it really gives a nice shape! got compliments all night when i wore this to a formal dance, but i could see myself wearing this again and again for holiday parties or other occasions!",5
"Someone else mentioned that this fit like a grandpa sweater and they were absolutely right. it's definitely loose fitting, but it's really cute and well made. i usually get a medium size in tops/sweaters but, after reading the other reviews, i ordered the small and i'm so glad i did - it's the perfect casual cardigan. i wish it came in more colors!",5
"I bought this top in a large. i washed it in cold water, and it shrank just enough to flatter. the material is great, in that when i washed it, the blouse hanged quite nicely, no ironing needed. also, the material is heavy enough that no tank is needed underneath the top. thakoon had made the same top last summer, and it had cost around $500. this top is even better due to the material, and i could buy it for a fraction of the price. highly recommend!",5
"I'm disappointed in these pants, which looked so beautiful online and even have pockets! in person the pattern and colors aren't as nice, the fabric is too thin, and the pants look cheap. the pockets are pretty shallow. the fit isn't good either. i ordered up (i'm between sizes) and they're still not as flowy as i'd have liked. these are too pricy as lounge pants for me to be on the fence about them, so they're going back. if you buy them knowing about the thin fabric and snug fit, they might wo",1
"I ordered this dress online but it turned out to be too small. i loved the color, fabric, and overall quality. i should have ordered one size up.",5
"I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse (the purple version) but the design is terrible for me. it's boxy, i didn't like the fabric, and the arm ruffles are bizarre. it's going back tomorrow.",1
"This top us flowy, breathable, and feminine. the fabric is light so it doesn't feel like you're wearing a swing dress with heavy fabric. it is sheer so a cami underneath is best. with flowers, less structured tops, i size down to a small or 6. some other tops i'd go to medium or 8.",5
I just received this in the mail and must say its one of my favorite purchases in a long time from retailer. the navy polka dot color combo is classic yet fun with the orange. looks great on its own as well as under a cardy. this will be in heavy rotation.,5
This is such a cute top. perfect for fall layered with a sweater!,5
"This dress is incredibly soft! with sleeves that can be rolled up or down, it is extremely versatile. while the dress is very comfortable and mostly fits true to size, i found it to be ever so slightly snug through the hips at first. however, i am somewhat difficult to fit with an accentuated hourglass figure. overall, i am very happy with this purchase and look forward to wearing it during my travels!",5
"This blouse was exactly what i was looking for. perfect for those last balmy days of summer. fabric a bit sheer, but it flows beautifully and the pleating details and higher neckline make this top truly stunning. it is very flowy, so if you're looking for something more fitted, this might not be for you.",5
"I love this top - it is the cutest top i've purchased in a while. the colors are so fun and the cut is flattering. it will go with plenty and will work for day and night, for work and on weekends. you need to get this top before it sells out. retailer please get this top in more patterns!!",5
"I ordered this in the tangerine and it is so cute. its very comfortable and flattering. i wore a tank under it, but didn't find it to be as sheer as other reviewers. i paired it with slim pants, brown suede ankle boots and a long necklace and it was one of the cutest outfits i have worn in a long time. i got a lot of compliments! i want this in tons of colors/patterns!",5
"I love this dress. it fits like a dream and is incredibly flattering. i vary between a 4 and a 6 in dresses, and the 6 was too large on the bust but the 4 fit great! the dress is longer than in the picture, the model must be wearing heels, but it doesn't quite hit the ground with flats. the fabric is light and airy, it comes across a little more formal in person but is versatile enough to be worn more casually as well.",5
I love this top. i also have it in blue! i wish it came in more colors/ prints! i would definitely buy it!,5
"I bought the navy polka dot top and i love the way the design lets you work orange into your wardrobe if it's a color you wouldn't normally wear. the blouse is sheer so a camisole is needed underneath; i'm looking forward to layering over the blouse in the fall to add a pop of pattern to a navy sweater.
i'm a 34f and size 12 fit me easily with extra room under the arms. the gathering stops above the bust so that it fit's snug above and loose below. worn loose, the blouse is fairly long, coverin",5
"Very graceful, long skirt. runs true to size and looks great! this is the kind of dress you will wear all summer long.",5
"This is one of my favorite recent retailer purchases. i wore it to work and a presentation. many people commented on how much they loved my top, and then turned back around to take a second glance to realize it wasn't paisley but leopards and tiger prints. it's really fun and fits well. great for work or dressed down with jeans.",5
"Not sure why this tunic dress is rated only 3 stars. i love it, as i do all coth & stone pieces. and it is cloth & stonw as another reviewer pointed out. the material is great and fit is tts except for the sleeves being just a bit tight. this dress does not run large as do some c&s pieces so don't size down. i'm 5'7"", 126 lbs and slender, and the m is perfect. if you have large or very muscular arms, this dress might not work for you. i plan to layer with a thin tee underneath, tights and boots",5
"For once i found a peasant top that wasn't a balloon. i'm 5'1 and curvier on top and the small fit great. the blouse billowed a bit but it didn't make me look like a hot air balloon. the pattern of the blouse, a mix of various floral swatches, is very pretty. the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall. i can't wait to wear it!",5
I found this in the returned section of the store in a large. i am normally a m but the fit would have been too small in the shoulders. it is very light weight and the color is much lighter in person which means it will go right into spring!,5
"Really flattering cut, this shirt is perfect for fall. got so many compliments the first time i wore it!",5
I love the tiger print. its subtlety is the perfect added quirk to an outfit.,5
"I bought this in the purple print. the fabric is soft - similar to silk. looks great with black, burgundy, tan pants/skirts. i find it comfortable and received compliments on it at work.i have not washed yet - cannot comment on washability..",5
"Incredibly flattering cut! i got so many compliments when i wore this dress to a friend's wedding. with the built in bra, you don't have to add extra uncomfortable layers. it stays put with or without the straps! the skirt is blissfully full and fun for twirling. i had a little trouble figuring out the belt, as it wraps around multiple times. but once i worked that out, it was perfect! love this cut! i hope they make it again it different colors!",5
"I am so in love with these pants. i generally stay away from wide legged pants because i think they make me look shorter (i am already short) but these are awesome. the fabric is not very thick so they are moveable which is great, but not so moveable that they feel like palazzo pants-they will hold their shape. i love the polka dot design so much and i actually really love the whole outfit with the black tie-top. these pants are long on me, but it isn't surprising since i am pretty short, i am t",5
"I am short so this ends up being really long on me, but i like that i can show off some amazing heels with this skirt. lately, i have been getting into grey so that it puts more attention on my accessories. the cut of this skirt is amazing, and the thick waistband is non-traditional which makes something that normally would be boring, really stand out (plus it helps hide baby fat!). the fabric is a medium weight, but it does flow nicely, and it does not seem to wrinkle easily which is a huge plu",5
"Gorgeous wide leg sweats. i did wear them outside but i wore with a long t because they are slightly see through if they are snug on your bum. they don't seem like they will last long because they are thin. but the cut is adorable and very flattering. they were a gift, not sure i would have spent $78 but i do love them.",5
Saw this in store and could hardly wait to try it on! the print is adorable and colors are vibrant. the material is heavier than i'd like for hot phoenix summers but decided to get it anyway. will be great for work. i noticed that there is a little more room in the chest area of this dress but not a deal breaker. seems to be well made in general and i love the pockets!,5
"This dress runs a little smaller than most maeve dresses, but it is so cute. i still ended up getting my regular size 6, but will need to wear spanx with it to get a smoother line. nice material, and great color. the store had just gotten it in when i bought it, and everyone who saw it was raving over it.",5
"This dress looks great with bright color, but size runs small.",5
"In retailer dresses the petites usually fit me better, i'm short, but this regular fit well. looks super cute, i've gotten so many compliments on it. comfortable, and the pockets are always nice.",5
"I loved this dress the moment i saw it online and debated ordering it as i wasn't sure the color would work on my pale skin, but wow, so pretty! it fits like s glove, in fact i almost had a hard time zipping the side where the fabric changes. the tie waist in a beautiful addition. the chest seems roomy enough, i am a 30 dd and the 0 petite fit. it is surplice so may give more if bigger chested. the skirt is a kind of lace and looks pleated at the same time. my only complaint is the side zipper i",5
"Beautiful color. emphasizes a small waist; top is fitted, so if you're curvy, beware. i'm a 32 ddd and size 10. skirt is roomy. agree with other reviewer that zipper is not smooth. reminds me a little of a prom dress i had in 1987... which could be good or bad ;)",5
I love these pants purchased them in white the fit is great the fabric is just the right thickness given they are white i don't want the fabric to be too thin a bit long so i will have to have them tailored but vey happy with these pants,5
"Absolutely lovely dress, in a gorgeous color, drapes well. the perfect blend of pretty and sexy. so much more beautiful in person!",5
"$78 for a pair of sweats seems like a lot of money, but not when you consider the amount of wear you will get out of these pants. they are thin and a little on the long side, but very flattering. plus, the thin material makes them perfect for summer nights. i love the pockets. not a big fan of the tie on the front, but that's just a personal preference. i won't just be wearing these on the weekend. i found lots of fun tops and jackets in my closet that will turn these pants into something i'll b",5
This dress has a very flattering cut and the style is very cute. i ordered a 4 petite and i typically wear a 2 or 4 regularly. the 4 petite was a great length (above the knee but not inappropriate). i wore to a bridal shower and received a lot of compliments!,5
"Aaaaaaamazing tunic, it was love at first sight and the detail is spot on. the total weight is heavier than expected but that is due to the impeccable quality of the top.",5
I'm so in love with these pants. they are so flattering and made of thick material. they do run a bit large though so i'd suggest you size down. i also like they they're high waisted. the gold button details are gorgeous as well. great pair of pants.,5
"Generally, i find sizing at retailer to be very consistent, so i ordered this dress in the same size that i order all of my other retailer dresses. the bust was way to small. so i had to go and return this and have the next size up shipped to me. it's till way too small! in addition, the shipping was terrible - the dress was just dumped into a bag with no attempt to fold this, and the right strap was defective! it's so irritating that i have to return this again!",1
"I wore this sailboat dress with blue wedges to a wedding and received tons of compliments from men, women and children. i love the material, pockets, and flattering cut. definitely iron it beforehand because it wrinkles.",5
Can't wait for the weather to get warmer so i can wear this one. as others have said the material is heavier but i think that's a positive as it is very structured and slimming. i'm a fan of maeve dresses and this is no different!,5
"I love these tees, i ordered 2 of the map shirt. they are comfortable and stylish. i knew that i would wear it so much, so i bought a spare.",5
This dress looks and feels classy and expensive! every time i wear it out i get compliments on the color and style.,5
"What can i say? this is a winner! it is stunning, gorgeous, a perfect summer dress that looks like sunshine and orange sorbet. it is classic, early 1960s look, which is exactly my style! i am usually a 14 or a 16, so i went with a 16 based on the reviews, and it fits divinely. i don't need another orange dress, but this is a keeper!",5
"Great dress, love how flattering it is and that it has a little bit of a retro feel. the dress is well made, too!!",5
"Maeve does not disappoint! unlike many of the tops and dresses which recently have been billowy, a bit shapeless, and not form-fitting, this hugs all the right curves. it's adorable, eye-catching and the pattern is so cute. i paired it with nude heels today and a jacket - so fun. just like the wynwood top in all 4 colors, the level of fun and playfulness is unmatched. it's tts. i am 5'4"" 115 and got the 2. thank you, retailer & thank you, maeve!",5
"This pull over is so easy to wear, very comfortable and has a great bohemian vibe. it's quality seems higher than what i was expecting- lots of details, tassels, fringe and hood. i travel a lot for work internationally and it's become my go-to for the plane, dinners and excursions- makes a boring outfit looks effortlessly cool. would love to see more items like this pullover in the store this fall.",5
"This pullover is perfect for spring all the way into fall. it is comfortable and the perfect piece to throw on over a summery tank and jeans. i've even worn it over dresses before and it worked great. soft fabric, but durable. i've had a lot of compliments on this pullover and recommend it for you!",5
"I got the dress with the boat pattern- such a fun dress and very flattering. it is definitely a coral, but i am able to wear this with my fair skin and will probably look better with some color as spring/summer finally arrive. i am only 5""2' so the length is great for me- i can wear this to work, but it would be pretty short for a tall gal. definitely recommend!",5
"Been wanting a pair of high waisted sailor pants for a while and these are perfect! love the fabric . will be able to wear these in the spring, summer, and into fall. bought the 2 petite and the fit is perfect. nice drape and figure flattering. even the petite runs long and will have to wear with a high heel rather than flats. bought the black and thinking about purchasing the white pair as well. very very nice and i am very happy with this purchase.",5
"Love the print and loose fit. doesn't look to wide on my top heavy torso and the sleeves don't cling to my chubby upper arms or tummy. wore all day today, first with shorts then with cropped jeans.",5
Got this shirt in the map design - super cute! it looks great with jeans or chinos in different colors. fun and different shirt. fit just as expected.,5
"These pants are a great buy now that it's on sale. even though the weather is warming up, it can be stashed away until next cold season because it is timeless. the fabric is thick but not bulky, the side zip is flattering, and the buttons add a touch of flair, which make the pants look very tailored. size 6 regular fit me well on the waist and hips (i'm 5'2"", 26 waist, 36 hips). i cut off 4 inches of the hem so i can wear it with 3-heels. i prefer the regular size for elevenses pants because the",5
"I have a different perspective than the other reviewers. the fabric is thin - and silky -perfect for summer! it is a pleasant change from other items in my summer closet. i bought the small, which i typically wear. it can easily be dressed up with heels and down with flat sandals. finally, it has pockets!!!!",5
"Quality is great, fits very well at waste, i am 5'4 135lb bought size 8p and it's good... i would require wear heels as it reaches and sits on the floor. they are more fall/spring/winter pants as material quite thick. overall, i am happy with them",5
As soon as i put the dress on i had to buy it! i felt like it looked and fit really well on. the dress pictured is an 8 and was a bit baggy up top. i'm a 32c so i purchased a 6 and it fits like a glove. i'm 5'8 and it hits just above the knee.,5
"I wasn't sure the color would be good on me (pale with reddish hair) but it is great for my complexion. on to the fit...it fits small, imo. i'm a 10, sometimes 8. i got the 10 and it is very form fitting. don't get me wrong, it does a great job of holding it all in and giving a great overall silhouette. but, it's not that comfy to sit in and i have to suck in to have a flat belly in it. trying to decide if i should send back and try a 12??",5
This blouse is perfect for a summer afternoon. it;s very light and the v neck back on it is super cute. the coloring is amazing. it's hard to find anything with those two colors incorporated. looks perfect with jeans or shorts and can be dressed up or dressed down. i am a solid 12 in everything...tops and bottoms and this shirt was no differemt. i like it a little loose so i went with my normal size but i am sure i could have gone down to a 10 as well. don't pass this up. it's a lovely lovely to,5
"These beauties offer such sweet respite from low-rise skinny jeans -- hallelujah! absolutely love the high waist and elongated line. i'm 5' 7' and the 25 are a great fit. very slimming, and already i've dressed them down with an off-the-shoulder top and wedge espadrilles and dressed them up with a silk blouse and heels. the design is very retro-fabulous, the quality top notch. love these and look forward to having them as a ""forever"" staple in my denim repertoire. i've been searching far and wid",5
"I ordered this suit online which is something i never do!! i am 5'6"" 120# and ordered the 6. it fits perfectly! it covers up nicely. i am small chested (34a) and it has padded cups which enhances my chest. the ruching hides any tummy flaws. really a slimming suit and great quality.",5
"I love these jeans! they are super soft and just the right weight for year around. however, they do run large. i normally wear a size 27. i am 5'7 and weigh 127#'s. because the other reviewers mentioned the sizing issue, i ordered a size down=26. they were too large and i sent them back for an exchange. these are perfect. i get tons of compliments when i wear them...i would love to see coh make them in a true black.",5
"Like other reviewers have mentioned, i was hesitant to spend so much money on a swimsuit. after lots of searching and reading reviews to try to find a bathing suit for a newly postpartum body, i went for it. i am so happy that i did - it fits perfectly. snug in all the right places, and makes my extra baby pudge seem nonexistent. before baby i was a bikini-only kind of girl, so i wasn't sure how i'd feel in a one piece in this style. it really is better than i could have imagined. i highly recom",5
"This top is a great addition to my summer wardrobe. i love it because it does not cling to my body, and in a hot humid summer, i want things that flow. this is super cute and flattering. the lace in the back is soft, and not too revealing.",5
Love the lace on the back! it's a sweet take on a typical tee! comfy! a little on the boxier side but a great tee.,5
"I love this jacket. i was waiting for it to go on sale, and it did... but only because of the fit.

the style is great and it has a peplum that goes all the way around the back. very different.

however, it runs insanely small. i'm not sure where the others are saying it fits true to size. it does not. typically, i'm a xs or s petite. i wear a 0 or a 2. this jacket i needed a 6 in. very small across the back.",5
This bathing suit is absolutely fabulous! it makes me feel like i stepped out of the notebook! definitely worth every penny!,5
"This blouse is beautiful, and very versatile, as others have said. i seem to have been buying many maeve prints lately, and got used to that fit. this blouse fits slimmer, but not tight, and ends up extremely flattering. the arms are also a bit slimmer in cut but not too tight -- the fabric has a little give/stretch and so even f they aren't totally loose, it's still comfortable. the lace detail is subtle but pretty. i am going to wear this to death, i can tell.",5
"I love it! i was hesitant to spend so much on a suit, but it's well worth the money. i'm 5'3"", 140 lbs, and my stomach is my biggest problem area. i ordered a size 8 and it's a perfect fit and very flattering.",5
I love these jeans-the minute you put them on they feel broken in and comfortable. they do have a long inseam and need to be worn with a stacked heel but that adds to the aesthetic. i ordered my normal size-i usually wear a 27 and could have kept them-but wanted a snugger fit through the bum. so i gave them to a friend and ordered one size down and got the perfect fit for me.,5
For those of you that don't care for stretch jeans you would probably like these. they feel like 100% cotton but better. no stretch at all which i'm glad. i'm not a fan of the stretch. to me these are those comfy go-to jeans. i got my usual size 28 which i perfer in these because i can use the pockets with ease. the pockets are lower side pocket which are great! you will likely need to hem them unless you are pretty tall. i hemmed mine and you can't tell it. i'm not sure how much these could be,5
"The only thing i did not like about this jacket was that i could not find it in my size before it sold out! retailer, please bring back another iteration for spring!",5
"This top is beautiful. soft and silky and hangs in a very flattering manner. i am usually a 4, but sized up to an 8 to get a little more length. it drapes really nicely. i wear it with skinny jeans and a long necklaces for a casual, put-together look or it can be dressed up easily, too. i'm not sure what the previous reviewer meant about the neckline. it lays perfectly on me. highly recommend.",5
"I love this swisuit. it is very well made and super flattering. i've received so many compliments on it. i have 3 little kids (4, 2.5, and 7 months) so it is perfect for chasing them around at the pool or beach. i am still working on losing the baby weight, so the rusching in front works well to hide my tummy. i am 5'2 and about 116lbs and the size 4 works well. i'm hoping it will go on sale so i can buy another one, but i imagine these will sell out quickly.",5
"I have been wearing tankinis for a long time and haven't worn a one piece in years. i'm 40 and, let's be honest, things don't look the same in a bathing suit as they did 20 years ago. this suit is very flattering - i'm not obese, but i do have a bit of a jelly roll in the stomach area and the combination of the polka dots and the ruching, as well as the construction of the suit itself with the side panels, really camouflages my stomach area. although there isn't underwire, which i prefer, i do f",5
This is perfect if you are looking for comfort and style in the same bathing suit.,5
The fitted high waist with the wide legs make for a flattering and comfortable short. perfect length as well! dress up or down. love these shorts and wish there were more colors!,5
Have only tried on but it is a very cute skirt and i think will be comfortable to wear. i love the texture of the material. i do wish it came in other colors. it is a little heavier material but not too much.,5
"I was originally looking for a denim skirt with a fit and flare shape. i then saw this skirt and decided it was much more versatile than denim. it is a mid weight skirt, lined, good length...just above the knee, and the swingy shape is perfect. i will wear it now with boots and a chunky sweater. when it warms up, flats and a short sleeve sweater will be cute! i ordered a small, but i really should have paid more attention to the other reviews because it does run large! i ordered another one in e",5
This is online exclusive so i ordered both sizes xs and s. it runs pretty large so i kept size xs. the material can be stretched. but i like the feeling of it and very comfortable to your skin. i am so happy receiving so many compliments wherever i go!!!,5
I bought it in black and cream! great weight. soft fabric. beautiful lace.,5
"I ordered this in size xl. it fits true to size. it does have a boat neckline which runs a little tight on me. but, everything else feels comfortable. i know this isn't a flattering style. horizontal stripes on my plus-sized, pear-shape isn't my favorite. but, i love the back. the knot isn't very comfortable to lean against. i just love the lace in the back that i wear it when running short errands where i don't have to lean back a lot. it does need a tank underneath or it's see-through in the b",5
I purchased this top in the oatmeal/beige color. i love it. the material is very soft and it fits true to size. i would have purchased the black color too if it was still available.,5
"So happy with this top. i love the fabric, the colors and the flowy fit!  definitely recommend!",5
"I love this dress. it's adorable and great for summer with a unique style- it's a bit unusual with the high and slightly ruffled neck. it can easily be dressed up or worn more casually. this is the most flattering dress i've found this season (particularly around the stomach area). i'm 5""3' and took a petite size, which fit perfectly. this dress is a bit translucent, so skin-toned undergarments are a must.",5
"Like the other reviewer, i was super lucky to find this dress at my local stores. i tried both the medium and the small. usually at retailer, i wear a medium. however, this dress in a medium did not look flattering on me. it hung off my shoulders and the material was too loose in between the velvet tiers, making my bottom look bumpy. when i tried on the small, the dress fit and flattered me perfectly! by far the best dress i ever owned. i truly recommend you try this dress on before purchasing. fo",5
"I was pleasantly surprised when i received this top in the mail. i expected the top to be more of a tee shirt but it is very soft and more like a light sweater. i feel the sizing is true-to-size but the design is not meant to be close to the body. for me, the shoulders and length were perfect.

this top is all about the sleeves. matador? perhaps, but it was the sleeves that attracted me to this sweater. i will wear with with a vest, skinny jeans and booties.",5
"The fit was not flattering at all, but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.",1
"This dress is the best of all worlds: sophisticated, modern, and flattering. i was surprised that the ""dress"" is actually two separate pieces: a navy blue slip and a bold magenta lace overlay, which will be perfect going into fall and the holiday season. i had two babies back-to-back and am not back to my pre-baby shape, but i was pleased to see how flattering this dress was. i will be wearing it to a wedding in a couple of weeks, and i know i will feel comfortable and confident in it.",5
This is so cute and i love that it is not heavy or bulky.,5
Love this dress! ordered a 0p and it fit perfectly.,5
"I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors, but when i took this off the rack to try one, you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought, insulting quality, for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.",1
"This is a beautiful dress (and my husband agrees). i'm 5'5"", 114lb and the xs was long on me and a bit baggy on top. i looked in to having it taken up, but i think that will be hard to do without damaging much of what's elegant about the dress. i hope that someone with more curves and a bit more height is able to enjoy this one.",5
"The fabric is more sweater-like than it appears in the image, but it makes the dress both cozy and comfortable. the skirt is a faux wrap that's secured at the waist by the tie. overall, the dress is high-quality, true to fit, and very flattering.",5
This turtleneck is already wrapped and it's soon going under the tree for me! i bought it when i saw it in the store and tried it on. it's fitted but not too tight or snug... just fitted and flattering. the lace cutout area is so flattering and unexpected. i love this top and think it will be a wardrobe staple - both for dress and casual. (i'll wash it carefully just in case. it seems well made but i'd hate to snag the lace.),5
"I have vowed to only purchase high-waisted bottoms from here on out because they are just more in line with my style! these shorts did not disappoint. i love that they're versatile enough to wear with a cute top + wedges or with a t-shirt and flats. great find! (i got my normal sz. 25 which is usually a tight fit, these zipped up perfectly though!)",5
This is such a cool top/sweater. i like simple designs with a twist and the sleeves add that. great with skinnies and heels,5
"I do not think this dress runs large. i think it it is true to size. i am usually a size 10 and a 34dd. definitely curvy and tall at 5'8. the large was perfect for my bust. i ordered a med also, and it looks really narrow in the waist. length is below knees as pictured. i was finding that the zipper under left arm is very catchy. i even checked the med and it is worse. that concerns me, but love the dress so i am keeping the large. length is so hard. i hardly ever find a dress the hits a little",5
"Beautiful and femine dress. it comes with a slip which is a big plus. it fits well and the sleeves are flowy and just at the right length. the only downside is that the bottom is not hem and being lace, it is delicate. you have to take care wearing this.",5
"This is a very nice, well made skirt but beware, it runs extremely large in size around the waist. i usually wear a m in most things, and i am going to return this skirt for an xs.",5
"These shorts work well for shopping, running errands, or spending hours on dirty baseball bleachers. they are not too short and are true to size.",5
"Love the fit....not so tight you can wear a short top with these, but not slouchy either. color goes with everything. for wrinkles, i hung them and sprayed with water...wrinkles gone. bought 2 pair for traveling.",5
These joggers are amazing! they fit true to size if not a bit loose. i purchased my usual small (size 6). the seams are sewn perfectly and the fabric is dreamy. i wore these to work with sandals and was so comfy and appropriate all day in the hot weather. the color is a deep gray and goes with everything! the front panel makes them a bit more fitted and there is even back pockets!,5
"Really fun comfortable pants. i haven't worn them yet as its hot here but i can't wait. i tried them on with wedge sandals & a lacey bohemian top and they looked awesome. i also tried them on with white rocker booties and my vintage t that says ""italians do it better"" and a jean jacket...i'm loving the look & feel of them, bring on the cool autumn days.",5
This is so flowing and perfect to hide any flaws.i adore it!,5
"I do wish this came in a 30dd sizing, purchased he 32d and it fits, though the band is looser than desired. i am still keeping it. i love the back, will be great for some of my dresses ti used to wear strapless bras to wear. recommend.",5
"True to size if we take into account how some brands are making things bigger for hte size; i ordered both the xxs and xs, and xxs was more flattering (years past, xxs would be way too snug, my size didn't change). pros: i actually thought the cut was flattering on me, the top is very cute. hte bummer for me is the fabric, the grey part is not as sift as i would have hoped and the ""shirt"" part can wrinkle (did in the package). length was nice for both sizes, so overall, i would go smaller for a",5
"Okay, these are seriously the cutest black jeans i've ever put on my body. i can't say enough positive things about them. sure, the color bleeds a little (like the previous review stated), but they're black jeans. i haven't encountered a single pair of designer black jeans that don't have some color transfer. 

also, these jeans are really stretchy which makes them a dream to wear. 

here is my one complaint -- i am normally a size 29-30 depending upon brand, cut etc. i had to size down to a",5
"These are super comfortable. i love feeling like i'm wearing pajamas in public but being properly dressed, although i wear them around the house often, too. i don't regret spending this much money on these pants, it was worth it since i'm wearing them so much.",5
"I bought the denim ch rocket high-rise crop last spring and had so much fun wearing them that i had to scoop up these babys when i saw black!! same fantastic fit only i had to size up so i assuming they run small in black? i could sleep in these they are this comfy and so flattering! i've got a flat behind and the placement of the pockets really give that lift i need in back! i'd buy one in every color if i could, so worth that price tag!!!",5
"I stalked the website to get this in a pxxs. it runs a tad large. this is a beautiful garment. i receive many, many compliments every time i wear it. in fact, nearly everyone comments on it. it is surprisingly warm for a cape. i love that it works so well over my bulkier sweaters. as others have mentioned, the buttons are a little difficult, but i found that they got easier with multiple wearings. i disagree with the reviewer that feels the collar must be worn up. i actually like the collar down",5
From the moment i saw this top i knew i had to have it. the colors of the embroidery are just so beautiful. it is even prettier in person than it is online!!,5
"Love this top. it is a little big through the body/waist, i thought it would be a little more fitted but i still love it. the bow really makes the shirt",5
"I own many of the natori feathers back close bras and decided to try the front close version for spring/summer tops and dresses. i purchased the yellow and got the matching hipsters panty. i no longer see the yellow available but you could find elsewhere or maybe retailer will bring this color back (it is lovely!)? for sizing, i tried my normal size (34b) and the cup size larger per other reviews. the 34c did end up fitting better so i also recommend going up a cup size. excited for warmer weather",5
"I loved the colors of this vibrant dress. the beading is fabulous. the dress does run small, i sized up one size. i wore it out and got a lot of compliments",5
I would buy these in every color! they're incredibly soft and stylish and feel like wearing pj's in public!,5
"As a mom, items in my wardrobe that are easy to throw on in a flash, comfortable to run around in with my kids, and still look like i took some time putting together my outfit are priceless. these fit the bill on all counts. they look fantastic with a pair of booties and a light, flowing top.

these have to be the most comfortable joggers ever made.",5
This top makes me feel like the artist i am. it's so beautifully embroidered and detailed! i wear it with cords or jeans and it never gets boring. it was worth every penny!,5
"I loved this top so much that i ended up purchasing it in another color. it works with so many different outfits, both casual and dressy. it is super comfortable and so soft. i would definitely recommend it!",5
Oh this is so much prettier in person! what you can't see from the pics is that the bottom flutes out a bit. it is quite charming. fits true to size.,5
I love how this long sweater drapes. it's soft -feels great on - and looks fabulous over leggings or skinnys!,5
"I love everything about this dress. the style, fit, colors and design of fabric, quality and feel of fabric. so happy and highly recommend!",5
"I love this top. other reviewers have mentioned the softness of the material and the cozy, perfect for fall/perfect for the sf bay area ""winter"", but i would like to call out my favorite element of the top being the scoop in the back. it adds just a little bit of soft sexiness while being just right for a comfortable weekend sweater to a dressed up office appropriate shirt.",5
"This shirt is so soft and very flattering. i ordered the navy in a medium (5' 10"" 150 lbs). love how it scoops in the back.",5
"I get nervous shopping online, but this top fit perfectly - wasn't too long or too short. it has nice flow and dresses up or down depending on the look you're going for. i got the off-white with blue polka-dots and love it!",5
Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,1
"I'm 5'7"" with a 36 b bra size and a size 4 fit perfectly and could not have been more comfortable. one big plus for me is that it is virtually wrinkle free. i purchased the orange which is a lovely muted orange, not neon or too bright and received multiple compliments when i wore it to work the first time.",5
"Bought the gray online just to try it and i've already worn it 3 times! very soft, love the flowiness, and the scoop in the back gives it a slightly less casual touch without losing comfort. the only concern i have is that it may pill up a little and not sure how it will hold up in the wash. i'm 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, curvy/muscular frame and the size small was perfect (true to size).",5
"I ordered this in the burgundy and am in love with the print and color, very feminine without being over the top.
i'm 5'4"", 123lbs, 34a and the 2 fit perfect. the cut is drapey without being maternity like and i appreciate that's it not as long and full as many of the other tops out there, making it easier to wear with some pants or skirts. it even has little snaps to hold your bra strap in place, although i doubt i would use those. this top is appropriate for any age without looking too girly",5
"This is such a fun happy dress. i saw it in the store on the rack that has online returns so there was only one available to try on. it was a size 4 and i usually wear a 6 in retailer brands. i loved the dress and tried it anyway and it fit perfectly which is why i think it runs a bit large. ( for reference, i am 5'2"" and 140 lbs., hourglass shape but a bit fluffy in the tummy and upper arms.) it has an empire waistline and a zipper in the back. it is so light and airy and super comfortable. it ha",5
"Lovely summer top, comfortable and cool for hot summer days. beautiful fabric, fits tts. highly recommend.",5
"I just love the bright yellow floral pattern and the off the shoulder sleeves. the loose fit is really ideal for when i just want to throw something on and run out the door but look super cute at the same time. it runs a little large to give you the flowy look, but i like things flowy so this wasn't an issue for me but a plus!",5
"Wow... great top, i have all the colors now. wow like them all. great weight cozy but not too heavy. nice that no pilling either! love it.",5
"I rarely buy anything at full price at retailer. but, after trying this dress on last weekend i had to buy it because i couldn't handle the thought of not having this dress in my life! i'm 5 feet tall and a size 12, so this was definitely a maxi on me. but, there is just enough room at the bottom that i can safely wear it with flats. i'm very pear-shaped and this dress is extremely flattering on me. even my husband agreed that i needed to buy it even though he hates my shopping/clothing add",5
I purchased this top as a swim suit cover-up and it is perfect! i was counting on the model in the photo being tall so that the top would be longer on me and that was true. great product.,5
"Being a 34d, i was nervous about the gaping between the top two buttons given the other reviews i read. they're right - it totally gaps even when standing still. so i took it to the tailor. they sewed the seam between the top two buttons. easy fix for a blouse that otherwise works. the color is great (i got the red one) and i like the fabric. i didn't think it hit awkwardly at the bottom seam. looks great with skinny white jeans.",5
"I'm glad i tried this on. i was drawn to the burgundy and pink floral print, but i wasn't so sure about the cut or style of the top. once it was on, however, i loved it. i don't much care for the a-line tops that remind me of maternity wear. they're cute on rail-thin, young girls, but not so much on mom-bod women in their 40s. this top is the exception. the details from the buttons to the thin pleats, the unique cut of the bust-line and the print make this top both lovely and flattering. i wore",5
"I'm a big fan of maeve products. still, even when i like something, i always prefer to try on in the store just to be certain. i decided to risk it this time and was so happy when this top came and it fit perfectly. i'm 5'3, 150 lbs but carry more weight on bottom so i ordered the 8. it's just right--cute and flowy. i'll probably get another one in a different color!",5
"What a delight of a dress! i saw it online and it piqued my interest in person too. with only one size available, i was limited to try on a dress two sizes too small, so i've factored that in to my review. the dress is very light and would be see through without the attached slip. the length fell just above my ankle with the design allowing for a movement and flow to the bottom. the colors are vibrant in person, perhaps even more so than online. the fit seems to be true to size, though i have to",5
"I got this in the green blue pink motif and i love it. really nice flow and not tent like at all. 5'8, 135, and in a size 6 i don't find this shows my stomach at all. it's really comfortable and i love the colors. i did get this in store at 15% off and i think it's a little pricy for a rayon shirt without the discount.",5
"Very comfortable sweater. tts. i felt the back was a little too low to wear to work, but it works perfectly reversed. tempted to buy it in another color.",5
"This shirt was exactly what i was looking for. it's fitted at the top with just the right amount of swing. some of retailer's shirts can have too much swing for me, but this is just right. the color is great too!",5
"I agree with other reviews; this shirt is more like a thin sweater. it is so soft. i was walking around the first time i wore it asking people to pet me. i just got it on sale and wore it twice this week already. i've gotten so many compliments. i bought this on sale in grey. i love it so much that i just bought a navy and burgundy one too. it runs slightly large, but i like my comfortable sweaters to fit large. definitely an important staple to any wardrobe.",5
"A while back the moss ikat print appealed to me online but sometimes these style tops look maternity on me so i passed up. well abt a month ago i spotted the 'moss' in the store & had to try it! it really is cute & love the print even more in person. the size 4 was fine but the armholes exposed the bra a little & i wondered if it wld be a little too short after washing. well, the size 6 was a little longer & a tad more flowy, & oddly the armholes covered the bra (the 4 didn't). i went w/ the siz",5
"This is such a cute summer tank to wear with capris or shorts. it is loose fitting and while i normally prefer the petite sizing at 5'1, i got the 00 since i liked the longer length. i purchased the wine and navy colors and the neckline isn't too deep at all. love it!",5
"Love this sweater. one of my favorite fall purchases by far. love how it hangs - especially the low back. it's simple, comfortable yet so chic at the same time. i bought the grey and goes great with skinny jeans and boots.",5
"I wore this tunic everyday on vacation in hawaii. runs a little small, i'm usually a small and the x-small was just right. perfect length, short but not too short.",5
"This dress ran large on me. i am a 10, sometimes an 8 but went with the 10. it just hung on me, giving me no shape. the colors are pretty and the dress was nice, but i expected it to wow me more for the price. sending back, may try again if the next size makes it to sale.",5
Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days. classic red and black check with a fashion flair. great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry. a great find!,5
"I was hesitant to order these especially because they didn't have a petite since there's shipping and i thought i might have to return them. i know that most shorts from retailer run a little big (i'm usually a 4 but in retailer bottoms 0-2). i ordered the 2 regular since there were no petites. they're not too high waisted (i think they could have gone higher) but they're not low, either. love them. they're so fun and i can't wait to break them out.",5
"I love this dress-i have it in the other color (black and white) but now i see this color scheme and i think i may actually like this one better. i love the wider stripes near the waistline which gives it a slimming appearance. the knotted look gives this dress a beachy feel which gets me in the mood for summertime. i love that the pattern is bold, but the color scheme allows this dress to still stay in the casual category and still be insanely flattering. i love that i could wear this dress eve",5
Versatile and fun dress. color is better in person than picture. looks great with jeans jacket for chilly moments. doesn't wrinkle on long airplane trip and rolls up teeny-tiny for packing!,5
I agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that didn't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness. i mean for the price shouldn't it be lined or something. when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low. but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i can't really complain too much. plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off. i gave up at that,1
Love these shorts. such a pretty print!,5
"I love the design of this cape. most capes are coats which can only be wore in the fall months here in the midwest since winter is too cold. this cape is more like a layering piece for indoors similar to a cardigan sweater, which i like. it can be wore in an office setting or out on the town with jeans. the constructions is well made as well",5
"This dress didn't work for me at all. i'm 6ft tall, 160lb, i usually wear size l 8/10, but based on the reviews i ordered an m. the material of this dress is very soft and fuzzy, color is about the same as pictured, also length is appropriate. dress is very thick and warm, the fabric however has no stretch at all, dress is very specious and shapeless. there is allot of room everywhere except shoulders & sleeves, i thought that area was tight & snug which is strange because it runs large everywhe",1
"I saw this in the store and wanted to try it on, but ran out of time (a week or so ago). i thought i would need petite, but surprise, it does not come in petite...so i started obsxessing that i had to try it on, whcich i did yesterday. mistake, because i love it, and even if it is not peite, it workedc (with heels), and online it already says only a few left, so my size will not make it to sale... so i bought it full price.

cut is very flattering, and colors are great. also can be worn any seas",5
"I love this blouse!! the shape is very flattering. the fabric is sheer, perfect for those hot summer days. i especially like the way the sleeves fall, just enough flounce. the buttons are a great detail. i didn't bother undoing them, just threw it over my head. looks great dressed up or down.",5
"Very pretty color (slightly darker than on my computer), a bit like a light periwinkle/lavender... embroidery is lovely and the dress has a fresh spring-like quality. the style is a basic shift, but the color and details make up for the straight shape. great dress for the spring/summer months. good quality and was a nice deal on sale!",5
Beautiful top!  had trouble with the buttons but i just slipped it over my head to avoid trying to get the buttons loose.  it will look great with dark jeans and mules!,5
I bought this shirt because the reviews convinced me to. i bought it in the blue color and it's really cute. the design on the sleeves is also great and the back of the shirt looks cute too!,5
I have this top in both the green and blue and live them both. the back of this top is so cute and makes the whole top.the embroidery  is cute too.,5
"I was hesitant to try this duster vest because i'm on the shorter side (5'1 110). i was very pleasantly surprised when i tried it on and love it! i ordered a xs petite and yes it is long (as it is supposed to be), but fitted enough that it looks very cute paired with skinny jeans and boots. the fleece lining was substantial and the outer wool was very soft. definitely a keeper!",5
"Hi quality fabric and detail. fit really well. i'm 5.4, 120 and they will be a staple of my summer wardrobe.",5
"I love this little vest! such an easy outfit completer. just throw it on over jeans and a tank or long sleeves and voila...effortlessly chic! the colors pop and it's the perfect length. if you're on the fence with this one, definitely give it a try. you won't be disappointed!",5
"This is the first thing i saw when i walked into retailer and immediately snagged it. it is so flattering and true to size. pretty colors, unusual styling. there is nothing about this beauty that i don't like!",5
"I saw this at my retailer store and hesitated to try it on as it looked so long. i'm only 5'1"", so it goes to above my ankles. it's like a midi dress on me, but i really love it! it is so flattering. there is a inner lining that smoothes out anything you don't want to show. it's the usual bailey 44 great quality. so slimming! hugs the booty in the right way! definitely worth the money!",5
I love the tie dye and the accent stitching. back detail is fun!,5
I was wavering on this post purchase but then decided to wear it to a store opening event and double digit people asked me where i got it or commented that they liked it. i guess i made the right decision! the inside is a super soft gray jersey knit. wears great with black.,5
So cute. modest length. perfect with a flowy top and wedges for date night or t-shirt and flip flops for a little dressier daytime. love the colors,5
"This is a great tee. true to size, i ordered the large and it skims nicely over my hips. it has lovely quirky design features in the back and pinkish cross stitches on the sleeves and shoulders. i got the blue and it looks just like the pic. great weight for the rest of summer into fall. perfect addition to my casual life style.",5
"I'm not really sure what the big to-do about the buttons is all about - i was able to slip the blouse on over my head without undoing any of them with no problems. yes the buttons are difficult, but unless you're breastfeeding, they shouldn't be a deal breaker! the blouse is exactly what i was expecting. so pretty, feminine and flattering. also, though it is a tiny bit sheer, i plan to wear it with a nude bra and no cami.",5
A serious joke. i struggled with the buttons for a good 10 minutes and gave up after the 3rd button. i'm not sure what they were thinking.,1
Beautiful and comfy!!!! love it!,5
"I absolutely love this dress! it hugs your body without being clingy - very flattering. the fabric is so soft. i am 5'7"" - 120 lbs - and i usually take an xs or s - i got a m in this dress because of the style and fit and it was perfect.",5
"I gained a million pounds in the last couple years so now i usually stay away from anything clingy or stretchy. but this dress is genius. it somehow looks smooth over everything while clinging to the curves in all the right places and none of the wrong ones. i'm 5'5"", about 190 pounds, and have a proportionate hourglass shape. the m actually fit great. normally i'd wear a large but the stretch and flattering cut of the dress made the m look better. i would venture to guess most people could size",5
Perfect except a little snug around the hips. very forgiving silhouette.,5
"I purchased the washed-out blue color. it is lovely with blue or black jeans. medium fit great. it is heavier cotton, and ever so slightly stretchy. this is not the kind of cotton to eventually come out of the dryer with tiny holes around the bottom of the tee. it is very comfortable. the embellishment on the sleeves is a nice touch, and i like the yoke with loop closure on the back. a fun addition to my casual wardrobe.",5
"I love these shorts. love that the inseam is longer than 3"". the pattern is awesome, perfect for spring. my thighs are always going to be bigger than most, so i sized up 1 size like i do in all cartonnier pants. these are a must have for spring/summer!",5
"I saw these shorts while leaving the store and immediately went back to the register to add them to my wardrobe. they fit me true to other cartionnier clothing. i'm 5'7"" 126 lbs and took a size 6. there is a significant amount of stretch in them, but do not grow as the day goes on. the colors are bright and fun without looking juvenile.",5
"Let me start by saying i was not in the market for a new dress. i bought this because it was retailer day and because in my seasoned experience as an online shopper this many positive reviews is rare so i'd better listen up. and because i really like the other bailey 44 dress i own. wow! i am glad i made the impulse decision to buy this. i love it, my husband loves it and it's comfy. for reference i did size down and went with a petite. had i not i think the dress would look on me like it does on",5
I love this short. i normally wear size 10 this short just bit larger than average 10 .it is not to short not to long just perfect.,5
I love this dress. very comfortable. soft? absolutely!,5
"I was sorry to miss the original offering of this dress when it went on sale, so i jumped and ordered the gray/blue/green/black stripes when offered. i purchase almost all of my retailer clothes online, the dresses i am interested in are not generally offered in my local store, so there is always that moment of truth when i get to find out if something i fell in love with actually works for me... as everyone else has said, this dress is fabulous! i got my usual size 10. i am 5'5, small busted and",5
I never write reviews and i do a ton of online shopping but i had to write how amazing this dress is. so happy with this purchase. totally worth every penny! it fits like a dream- the rouching on the side is so pretty and i love the full coverage at the top. such he pretty colors too. perfect dress!!!,5
"Love this top.. very flattering and form figure.. i dont see the issue with the buttoms, has elastized back enough to pullover in and out. material is thin yes .. but not so see through. i'm so keeping this .",5
"At the altar of bailey 44!  all hail the 'gathered stripes dress' because it can do nothing wrong, especially to my body.  i got the mp and this piece totally enhances what little i've got.  so happy!",5
"Love these! i'm about 5'4, and they fit right at the ankle. the slit gives them a little more detail than regular jeans. i've worn them several times, and they haven't stretched out at all. perfect for spring.",5
"I absolutely love this dress. it is super soft and flattering for my body type (petite and curvy). though, i wish it did come in petite, as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better. but that didn't stop me from purchasing as that's an easy alteration. very flattering. love it.",5
"I have athletic calves from running, so i really struggle with straight/skinny jeans. but these fit me just fine (and don't look like jeggings). i think the slit helps. i have a 29"" inseam and these hit just above the ankle. great find - especially on sale.",5
"I was lucky enough to hit retailer day in san diego and snagged this little number - it is truly better looking in person. the dress hugs in all the right places and actually fits tighter than the model shows, but the material is that soft, but stretchy and gently molds to the shape of your body. i was really surprised, i would have never tried this dress from the photo shown. so glad i went in - it's really adorable!",5
"This is a very fitted dress. i love it and it is very comfortable but might only be appropriate for date night as it really hugs curves. there is a lining of the same material underneath that holds you in a little. i think it could go with a lot of different shoes and you could dress it up or down with jewelry, jacket, even a large sweater over the top. tts. i definitely would not recommend sizing down! i'm a 8/10 and the med is right for me.",5
"I love wearing this so much! i wear it with leggings, jeans and i also like to pair it with is a long linen skirt that i have. i purchased it in plum and then went back for a second in moss. i got them before they went on sale for fear they'd be out of my size. i am very happy with my purchase! i highly recommend.",5
These leggings are perfect!! i normally struggle to find pants that are comfortable and flattering but these are exactly what i've been looking for. they are so versatile - they can be worn for a lazy day in or a night on the town. a new staple in my wardrobe!,5
Great jeans. especially if you are on the shorter side (5 ft 3 for example). they run very large. i typically buy size 28/29 and bought a size 27 and had a tailor take in the waist a bit. i'm syked for these for fall!,5
This tee has a loose fit. very comfortable. covers my backside with inches to spare. flattering fit although oversized. i'm a small-medium in most retailer tops. the small fit me nicely. 34dd 140lbs 5'6. bought it in olive and mustard. great for layering or weekends.,5
"Soft fabric and long, flattering, perfect for leggings",5
"I am pleasantly surprised by this purchase. i went back and forth on buy-in this, but ended up trying it out. so glad i did! it is very flattering and a very nice color. it fits perfectly and i look forward to wearing it with my distressed denim and boots for fall.",5
"I love the cut of this top, it flares out nicely, and is very stylish. the blue is also soft on every skin tone! even my super pale skin :-) i like that it has some detail, not just the plain chambray/denim color. the xs was nice, i didn't try petite or xxs, just bought the xs in store... you can adjust how tight the fit is by tying the top and loose is nice in this style. the length was also good. (115 lbs, 30dd chest)",5
"This is a thick material, but it is also airy. i got the white and don't have to worry about it being see through. it is a little boxy, but the hem hits a good length and doesn't bother me. really great for work in the summer and going between really hot and really cold temperatures. a good basic piece that can be dressed up or down that is definitely worth getting.",5
"Although i love retailer, this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking.",1
"I'm thrilled with this purchase, and looking forward to spending many years with this classic. on the subject of fit; i generally wear size medium for tops, but my broad shoulders occasionally have me in larges. since the thick-textured fabric is mostly cotton and minimal stretch (with a mix of linen), the larger size will provide more room and comfort. i'm honoring my ""tts"" choice for folks who prefer a more ""fitted"" look. overall this piece wears well!!",5
I ordered the dark turquoise skirt and it fits perfectly! the materials is a very high quality corduroy and the color is beautiful. i really like the buttons on the front as well. gotta love warm skirts for colder climates!,5
Love this shirt! so comfortable and the style is really flattering.,5
"Adorable & comfortable. i'm 5'3"", 115 lbs, and ordered an xs.",5
"I absolutely love this top! it is soft, comfortable and perfectly flowy. this is definitely my favorite go to casual summer top.",5
"I have never looked good in a legging. stretchy denim ""jeggings"" are usually the most i can get away with. but i am amazed how flattering these are! the fit is great (i got a m cause i'm small, but curvy in my hips/butt), the material is thick enough not to reveal too much, and the faux pocket in the back does a lot to make one feel less exposed. the length seems like it would be a great compromise between short and tall girls too -- i'm pretty short, but they aren't too long on me, there's a ve",5
"These are the best leggings i've ever worn. because they are structured and substantial, they are less casual than ordinary leggings. i bought them for a trip to paris, and i wore them many times. they're sleek, stylish, comfortable, and they go with everything!",5
Love this skirt!  i purchased the chino skirt during the summer and wore it weekly.  this skirt is the fall equivalent!  flattering and true to size!  there is some stretch to it so it's very comfortable.  highly recommend!,5
"Nice chunky knit cotton tank with cut-out shoulders. sporty looking. armholes are the right size and bra doesn't show. no holes to see through, even in white. tts. i took my usual medium. falls to about hip bone, approx 20"" from shoulder. not tight, not baggy, but has a nice comfortable drape. i got in white. best to put it on before applying makeup. this goes great with black and white print pilazzo pants! love this top.",5
"Bought this skirt in the light plum color. nice soft corduroy fabric.
it fit well. not too short. 
will be cute this fall with a sweater and boots. 
my only complaint. i wish it had pockets.",5
"Living in alaska means fall starts early and winter runs long. this great little skirt is perfect for casual fridays and weekends. i am 4'11 and ordered the petite 4, which is a little big around the waist, but could tuck a sweater or shirt in. absolutely love this skirt and thinking about purchasing in another color.",5
Nice rendition of a summer halter that resembles denim. i bought my normal small but could have downsized to an xs. if your busty stay with your normal size as it is more tts. i like the blue plaid colors and the soft cotton material it's made of. it has a very nice flow with the cute peek a boo back neckline. the interior fabric lining is also a quite lovely chambray blue that nicely offsets the blue plaid.,5
"This shirt is so pretty and casual however with a nice scarf, it can also be worn to a nicer restaurant. it also hides all my flaws. the only concern i have is, it's a bit thin material and not sure how long it will last. having said that, i love how the material looks and falls on my body. i love it so much i bought a white shirt as well as the lavender.",5
"I bought this top on sale in the store and immediately came home and ordered it in another color online. i love the length even in the xs which isn't always the case. i am 5'9"" and a size 2 and the xs fits me perfect even after washing and drying a couple times. looks cute under sweaters and vests. can wear all year round. lightweight and good neckline.",5
"I bought the first one in the gold color, which i call mustard. i really love the high-low style and looks great when worn with a long necklace(s). when they went on sale, i bought two more, black and grey. i love that they are perfect for layering when it's cold, but that i can also wear them alone, in other seasons. thy ran a bit large for me, so i was able to purchase the small. i am small boned, but large in the bust. i'm also short, 5'2"", but they don't look too long, especially when i wear",5
"Great style and fit. i purchased the wine color, and i'm probably going to also get the other two. i typically wear a 10-12 in skirts, bought this in a 12 and it fits perfect. however, the fabric is super stretchy so a 10 may have been sufficient.",5
"Love the material (more natural fiber than synthetic), the pattern, and the colors. also, it is cozy! the one con is that it is really big and crazy-long. so long, that it may be a show-stopper. on the fence about that.",5
Love this dress! the color is gorgeous! what you don't see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress. i received so many compliments when i wore this dress. the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight. you can wear this dress year round. i love these kind of dresses! retailer knows how to do this right! love this store!,5
"I ordered this dress in the green ,and i love it. it does run a little large so i went down one size, which was ok by me!! it is super cute!!",5
Fits great and goes great under cardigans and jackets,5
"This top is super cute, nice and light for the hot weather, with a tts fit. the model is wearing a light-colored bra, so it shows through. but, with a black bra, there is no problem.",5
"This top is great! it looks much better in person. it's still kind of a faded look but it's not as light as shown here. also, the exact location of the plaid is different on each top. it runs just a tiny bit large but i liked it loose so took my normal size. there is another fabric lining the front in a very cute print. will be a nice, loose and cool top for summer. love the tie in the back as well.",5
"The tank is very structured, thick yet breathable, not see through. the coral is much brighter in person, and the white is more like a light cream color. the white is versatile for all seasons but i like the coral because it's such an unusual color. size regular xs is fitted on me (not too tight, not too loose, but over the course of the day, it stretches a little) and the hem falls at the upper hip (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). my favorite part is the arm holes are not too big. the knit a",5
"I saw this skirt at my local retailer store and thought it was just another corduroy skirt until i got up close and personal. it feels so soft yet there is structure to the skirt, hurray for a bit of spandex for movement. the first button is different from the rest of the buttons and i appreciate that type of details. only the wine color was available in the store and it is shown just like on the photo. the skirt falls right above my knees and size regular 4 fit me very well (i'm 5'2"", 26 waist, 3",5
"I ordered the ivory of this dress, expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead, i received a dress that looks like a ugly, vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great, either. big and boxy. it could acco",1
"Light weight and cotton, great summer top. runs a little big but it suits me. i'm short and find the straps a drop loose because they're a fixed length meant for someone a little taller than 5'1"" me, but they are not falling down so far. also, if you look at the photo of the model wearing the top in black, you can see through the lace to the bra underneath. if you just wear a bra the same color as the top it's not at all noticeable. great piece for summer.",5
"Bought this dress online in my usual 0p for a special event and liked the cut but found the area around my stomach and the bottom of the open area on the back to be a bit large. this in the back created the potential problem of flapping open so that you could see down the back of the dress. surprisingly they had 00p as well so i reordered that one and love it. 

keep in mind that the style is very subdued and elegant especially from the front with a little bit of fun added to the back with the",5
"The material is horrible, it's heavy and cheap. the skirt does not ""flow"" as it appears in the photo. instead the bottom part of the skirt just stands out like ruffles. am returning.",1
"I love this top! it's classic and classy but with a fun update being a henley. the gingham is super cute, the texture of the fabric is really nice and soft and thick (it is fully lined). i plan to layer it for winter and can't wait to pair it with white capris come spring. i bought my usual size xs and it's a little snug at the hips (where i'm more curvy) but perfect overall. highly recommend!",5
"I love the classy design and the little surprise bow in the back. i am 5'2"" and about 107lbs, size 0 fit well. i was afraid it might be too short, but on me it is just above the knee. the bow on the back did not hide the bra strap on me, but the fabric is thick overall so that it can be worn without one. the fit is great once on, but it is a little hard to take off, since the zipper is not on the side so there is no relief in the arm/chest area. the color is beautiful, it's true to the pictures.",5
I bought the red and it is gorgeous. i love how it hangs - heavy but fluid. i usually wear a 4 but i bought a 6 and it was perfect.,5
"Skirt fit perfectly, nice construction - hidden zipper, full lining - nicely done. would love to see it in navy or black.",5
"Best beachy summer tunic in the store. can be worn knotted at the hip or worn straight. can be worn over jeans, shorts, a bathing suit, take your pick. wear it with a tank/cami underneath or not. it works wither way. asymmetrical cut. great for us long-legged tall people. fabulous buy. only con is that it's a tad delicate. unfinished hem and loose-knit. will easily snag if you aren't mindful. i recommend hand wash, air dry.",5
"I really like this top! it's lightweight, great quality, and i've worn it for casual weekend outings and also dressed up for work.",5
"Love this tank! i ordered a small and it fits beautifully. i am 5'5"" and 140 lbs. . tank is sheer so i wear a cami underneath. length is quite long but i wear it with skinny white capris and it looks chic. my only concern is the raw hem edge. worried about how this will hold up with some washings. other than that i love it. i received many compliments when i wore it.",5
"Even though this shirt is incredibly thin, i love that i can wear it multiple ways throughout the year. it can be used as a swimsuit coverup, with white jeans in the summer, over skinny jeans and with a sweater in the fall/winter. this is a great piece to own!",5
On a hot summer 90 degree day the blue ink on the dress stained the dress and my new tory burch bag. i would never have expected that the blue print would bleed all over me and my new dress. great dress and such a wonderful fit...too bad its unwearable now.,1
"This is a very comfortable bralette- the silk covers one's most sensitive parts, so it feels like you are wearing almost nothing. it's very pretty, too. i wear a 34b bra and the small fits me. it doesn't have a lot of support, but it's very comfortable for wearing at home or on errands. the cups are a little far apart, but it still works. if you're looking for something pretty and comfortable for casual wear, i would recommend this at the sale price.",5
"I bought this dress to wear to a rehearsal dinner. like other reviewers have said it is a true shift dress. i'm 5'2, 114lbs and the 0 fit me like a glove. it was a little hard to get the top on because the bow is not detachable (wish there was a snap or something) but once on i was in love. i may have to safety pin my bra to the bow so it doesn't show because it kept showing when i tried on. overall a very beautiful dress.",5
Very cute dress for 5'5 or taller,5
"I used to walk by this dress, thinking not much of it. but one day i realized it had a bow which im a complete sucker for. tried it on. fell in love. tried on the 4 and 6 - went with the 4, runs tts. if the dress is too large, the bow flips down and you can see too much gaping between your back and the dress. somewhere between a shift and a sheath is this silhouette. with my hair pinned up in a teased out japanese bun and great black heels, my valentine date fell for this dress too. he said it r",5
"Really cute top, normally order a s or xs. based on reviews, i ordered a m and good fit.",5
"This one arrived at my store and was sold out in two days! everyone loves it. the fabric is a woven material. very light, a little sheer but comfortable and really airy! it has a bit of weight to it, so it doesn't stick at all which is a win for me. the colors are perfectly neutral. this is as long as it looks in the photos. tunic length and i love it! i am 5'8 and it hits below my toosh. loved wearing this with leggings and jacket, or pairing it with denim. i adore it and i'm so glad i grabbed",5
"Cut out design, no seems or hems.
 very disappointed in retailer",1
"I was so excited to receive the playa tunic in the mail! i love the colors and the flowy bottom and raw edges. this tunic could be worn as a dress or with jeggings, jeans, or leggings. this is a wonderful fall transition piece!!",5
"Great cut & fit! the length is perfect, too. i like the weight of the skirt overall. good for all seasons.",5
I am usually an xs but ordered an xxs in this because it looked like it ran large. glad i did. it's still roomy but doesn't look too big. could be a swim cover-up or would look cute with jeans. very pleased.,5
"I love this dress but unfortunately it is so low plunge that i would have no occasion to use this dress, except for possibly a pool-side event.

i am a modest c cup and could not get away with wearing this dress anywhere.

if you do decide to purchase the dress, you can actually go a size down. i'm between a 4 and 6 and purchased the 4 and fits beautifully.",5
They are as comfortable as sweat pants. i can wear these all day and then some and be comfy. i love the fit (skinny's can be hard for me - i have athletic thighs) and the length is fantastic. i want more pairs in different washes!!,5
I love this cozy jacket. i wanted a neutral colored jacket for casual outings. this does fit true to size. i am 5' 2'' and 105 pounds. i purchased the xs. you can cuff the sleeves to shorten the length of the arms. it has a piping so it doesn't look odd if cuffed. i do find most things/brands at retailer run big on me but not this item.,5
This dress is comfortable and cute. i wear xs and this is true to size. the only thing i don't like is the neckline. it is very low cut. will have to wear a cami underneath.,5
"I was so excited to order this dress. i loved that it had a normal neck, nice length, and there wasn't a hole in the back. but this dress is just plain awful. the top fit tight across the bust, it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra. then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric. i could not get the zipper to lay flat. the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling. on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the",1
"I purchased this jacket in the beige color from the black friday sale and have already worn it several times. it is comfortable, warm. and stylish. i love it so much i got it as christmas gift for a good friend and my sister. as for sizing, i do find saturday/sunday brand runs a little big. i typically wear medium or size 8 in tops and bought the jacket in a size small.",5
"Got the jacket in blue xs, i am 5-1, 110 lbs. fits great and wanted the beige one too! however the beige color ones have a totally different fit! the beige jackets run big and i was swimming in the xs, hence the mixed reviews from other peeps.",5
"Love this jacket... perfect for replacing old hoodies with something a little more chic. incredibly soft, warm and cozy. love! color is true to picture and i found it runs true to size.",5
I actually bought this dress last year and they made another one in a similar dark floral which i also bought--because i love this dress so much! i wish they would make a different pattern--i'd buy a third one! the online picture does not do any justice to this dress. fits like a dream---soooo flattering. modest but not matronly at all. flows beautifully. i have received tons of compliments every single time i wear this dress. this dress is absolutely lovely. please make this in another pattern!,5
"So cute, warm and fashionable. i ordered a size down and it fit like i was in a sausage casing. gave that size to my daughter and i will order my usual size. the arms are small and the rest is true to size. love the quality softness and style of this. with a hood, for the win!",5
"I was a bit confused with all the reviews here. some said this runs small and others said it runs big
i decided to go to the store and try it. i'm 5'6 and 112 lbs. i'm usually size 2 or xs.
when i tried the blue one, xs is very tight on the arm and i would have to size up if i ever want to wear a sweater underneath.
however, when i tried the beige one, xs fits me well with some room for sweater.
either one is beautiful. great quality as you would expect from this brand.",5
"I ordered this dress in a size 12. i'm 5'9'' and 180lb. i usually wear size 14 but the 12 fit beautifully. the material has a nice stretch to it so that i think it would still fit whether i gained or loss 10 lbs. when i pulled it out of the box i immediately thought it read ""grandma"", but was pleasantly surprised when i put it on. it is snug in the waist and flares out nicely from there. it hits me on the knee exactly as it does the model in the picture. i plan on wearing this maybe for christma",5
"I received this dress as a birthday gift and am completely in love with it! there are some things about it that i wish i'd known (but are by no means deal breakers!). first, you can kind of see this in the model shot, the keyhole neckline is not sewn shut at all - it's completely open. it didn't cause problems for me, but some women may not be comfortable with that. my dress didn't have any zippers and so was a pullover. the band that runs around the waist has little to no stretch, so you have t",5
"I wished these fit a little better. unfortunately, they were a little tight in the thighs and if i didn't pull the waist of the pants up, i had sagging crotch and the pockets hung out. needless to say i made a return.",1
"Absolutely beautiful dress. i bought a size 8 and found it tts. i typically buy 6/8 in retailer dresses. the print is gorgeous (i am a sucker for anything with poppies) and i love the silky material; hugs your curves and flows nicely. i was worried the torso would be too long based on prior reviews, and because i am of short torso, but it fits well. would definitely recommend.",5
"The small, zipped and laid flat, measures 16"" across at the bottom of the armholes, 11"" at the waist and 18"" from shoulder seam to bottom edge. it's too small for a size 0, and not by just a little! too bad, because it really is very pretty.",1
"I love love love this dress! i am 5'4"" 117lbs and got an xs. it's just barely small on me but works great. it looks amazing and i can't always wear maxi dresses. they don't always work with my body type. this one is perfect. the color is gorgeous. i highly recommend this dress.",5
"Just bought this jacket on sale and i love it! it's like a soft compfy sweatshirt , love the longer length. i feel like it runs pretty true to size. i usually buy an xs or small and the small fit fine. the sleeves are a tad long but not too bad, the model has them scrunched up but i find they are too snug to do that. i would highly recommend this jacket, just love the feel and look of it.",5
"I am so pleased with this midi dress; i've already worn and laundered this dress multiple times and i cannot express how comfortable and cute this dress is to wear. best of all, the fabric is just substantial enough that there are no posterior lumps or panty lines that are visible and the v-neck is just low enough to provide a subtle sexy dã©colletage. i love the length of this dress as i really dislike my knobby knees and this exposes enough leg from the sides and disguises the ugly knees for me",5
"I'm small--5'1"" and 90 lbs--and the petite xxs fits really well. the fabric feels soft, too. i can't wait for warmer weather so i can wear this.",5
"I was a little hesitant to buy these given that i am just 5'1"" - i didn't want to look like an extra from the set of ""newsies."" but these are very well made and tailored for a woman's body...the trousers actually accentuate the waist and the cropped leg works well for a petite frame. they are nicely lined and the wool blend is soft and not scratchy. i love them!",5
"This dress is incredible soft and flattering. it sits higher on the waist than most other dresses i've received from retailer, which is actually great for me, as i have a short torso. i have been able to put it in with the regular wash cycle, which was a pleasant surprise. the only issue was with the overlapping fabric on the top; i ended up adding an extra stitch to avoid being totally exposed.",5
I love this jacket and the price was a great bonus. it fit perfectly and is nice cozy and warm. well made and the beige color is great.,5
"I splurged on this dress when it was first in stock a year ago and haven't regretted it for a minute. it is my go to dress for work, cocktails, and once, two weddings in one day! the print is gorgeous and the fabric is super comfortable. i love twirling in it as the dress has just enough stretch with a little flounce. the length is ladylike and the sleeves provide perfect coverage for my arms. the seam between the bodice and the skirt hits right at your natural waist and the look really flatters",5
"You want to buy this! it's so comfy and stylish, yet casual. the sale price is amazing. if anything, the arms of the coat are a bit thin compared to the body of the coat. overall, it fits well though. i ordered an xs. i almost want to order the other color i love it so much. i will probably wear this year round but it will be especially cute in autumn!",5
"Like other reviewers, i did find that this jacket runs big. i am usually a size 2p or an xs and found an xxs in store and fits well. it'll be a great everyday-jacket!",5
"This dress was hard for me to get on but once i did...my oh my.  i am quite top heavy including my upper arms and back, so forcing the waistband over my shoulders made me panic a bit.  after the struggle, it fits like a glove and skims over all my yucky parts!  can't stop caressing the fabric and i hope my date (aka the hubs) feels the same.  dress is not lined.  i would've liked a soft mesh type lining similar to what plenty uses.  petite was sold out so i bought medium regular and it skims the",5
"I love this jacket, but in contrast to the other reviewers find it to run a little small. i usually wear a small at retailer and got a size medium as the small was a little tight under the armpits. this might be because i have a large chest, but i wanted more room in case i want to layer.",5
Great dress for vacations!,5
"Poor quality, material looks much thinner and cheaper than pictured.",1
I feel in love when i tried it on! i'm 5'2 an usually have to hem long dresses - but this on fits perfectly. it's full length on me -it's shorter on the model but i think it looks better full length. and it's a gorgeous burgundy. soft and comfortable. can't wait to wear it!,5
"This tee is such a staple for me. i bought it in the green and it is such an elegant deep emerald. the perfect shade. the shirt has some detail that is not shown - there is stitching/seaming along the side in the front and back that give the shirt a good structure. the shirt also has a great weight to it. the knit is sort of a vertically ribbed knit but thicker than a classic ribbed tank top. the edges of the material are also open, almost-frayed edges. the additional detail on this shirt defini",5
I was just at the store and purchased this cute top which runs tts for me. i wasn't expecting to find anything at the store but the beautiful lace and adorable tie at the front caught my eye so i bought the small which is my usual size at retailer (34d-27-35) and it fits perfectly. the material is a touch thin but that's okay with me since i don't want heavy clothes for the warmer months anyway. i also don't find this top particularly see through as it's black and will wear a full coverage bra wit,5
"This is the most beautiful dress ever! i'm very short and petite with an hourglass figure and a rather large chest. this dress feels like it was made for me. i often have a difficult time finding a dress that flatters my figure and is slimming. i was shocked that it was even a little roomy in the chest. the cut is so beautiful and it is very well made. while the lining might be too short for tall girls, being only 5""1, the lining is perfect. the length in the back is just a teeny bit too long so",5
"The photo does not do this dress justice at all. it's a light lavender and extremely flattering. i'm athletic so have broader shoulders and hips, and this is an amazing fit for me. also, the front has a small button to make it more modest, which is closed in the photo of the model, but if you leave it open, va-va-va-voom! so, to summarize: beautiful spring lavender, fabulously feminine fit. get it!",5
I am 5'4 and a curvy girl and find this dress to be super flattering in fit and length. i got a size 14 which is my typical size. the slip is a little tight in the bust area for me so i find it easier to put on first and then the dress over which is possible because it snaps in and out at the shoulders. it arrived super wrinkled but i found tossing it in the dryer for a few min helped - is it dry clean which is slightly high maintenance but so cute it's worth it. great dress for transitioning in,5
Love how breezy this shirt is and adds unique texture & detailing to your outfit. the simple black color is a nice touch so the color does not compete with the detailing.,5
"Love this top, very flattering. love it so much, i actually wish it was a dress...a knit summer dress with a tie at the waist would be perfect. seems to run a little big, so if you're deciding between sizes, size down.",5
"I saw this online first and didn't care for it. then i saw it in-store and purchased it with little memory of the online experience, because the dress is that much better in person: it's (nearly) seasonless, looks great with fall boots, and has garnered many compliments. this is one of those that the internet can't really do justice to. i withhold a star for quality since the snap-in keeps for the slip were confusing (and maybe it's just the one i bought): one of the keeps was detached from the",5
"This top is very versatile. i wore it out to dinner with skinny jeans on a friday night, but it can easily transition to a saturday afternoon stroll around town top.",5
"I just received this top today, and as usual, retailer doesn't disappoint!! it's beautiful, runs a bit generous and has such pretty detail. i'm 5'2, 128 pounds and always wear a size small. this small fits well with just enough room to be a little generous around your waist. what a steal!! don't miss this perfect addition to any wardrobe.",5
This is a great little top. the tie sits right at the waist and loose enough to slide over top of pants or shorts. the detailing at neck and shoulders is very eye catching. i received several compliments when i wore it.,5
"I bought these on sale for a great price online without seeing in person and was pleased to find that they are very versatile, could be very casual or great for weekend shopping, etc . the purple is a great shade and the fit is great. i'm 135 pound for reference and i purchased the size 28.",5
"Fits great. structured, but still comfy. figure flattering.",5
So stylish. i have gotten tons of compliments on this sweater. i absolutely love it!,5
"Nice fit, very comfortable if you wear a thin shirt underneath.",5
"I purchased this in purple, and agree with previous reviewers who've mentioned that it looks more casual in person. it can be dressed up with the right accessories, though, and the fabric is really excellent quality, soft and durable. i really like the contrasting plaid back, it's a subtle but fashionable detail.",5
"My 16 year-old daughter fell in love with this when we saw it in the store at the beginning of the summer, but it was much, much too expensive. when i saw it on sale at the end of the summer, i jumped on it. she loves it.",5
I am in love with this suit. i got the white floral. it's beautiful and classy. it feels like great quality too! i am going to get the black color too when it's back in stock. i am 5'9 and about 140lbs (32 dd) and i'm wearing a medium. i got both the small and medium and decided to keep the medium. it does have more fabric with the medium but the bigger size covers my chest and bigger bottom.,5
"I bought a suit similar to this last year, and loved it! this year i bought the pineapple print, and it is beautiful (size 2). it is classy/sexy. i have a long torso, so i like that it covers me better than most one piece swim suits i try on. i highly recommend this product!",5
"A versatile, pretty and feminine addition to your closet. perfect with black pants, jeans, shorts...dress it up, dress it down.",5
"I added this to a stack of try-ons on my trip to retailer today not expecting to be impressed by this number but was blown away when i tried it on. 148 dollars is a little pricey but didn't hesitate it was so beautiful, i am a 32b and normally wear a size 6 and the small fit perfectly. can't wait to wear it on vacation in new orleans in a couple of weeks!",5
"I bought this earlier in the summer in size xl. i've gotten such good use out of it. the fit on me matches the model. the details of the crochet lace add such a nice touch. not your typical hoodie. but, just the same comfort. i've washed in cold in my machine & air dried. it hasn't shrunk. one of my favorite purchases. perfect for chilly weather or when you go into a/c areas. would love this in other colors. great piece!",5
I found this in your store and had to have it! i wore it on a date night and received more compliments than i can count!!!! the attention to detail makes this jacket special. i am 5 ft 5 inches 124lbs and a 4fits but a 6 is perfect for a sweater underneath. i actually went back a bought the other color. worth every penny.,5
This shirt is simply pretty. it's light and dresses up a distressed pair of jeans.,5
Gorgeous lace detail on this classic swimsuit. absolutely love it! fits true to size.,5
"This beautiful blouse first caught my eye in the store. i thought it was a bit pricey, but couldn't keep thinking about it. walked away without it! then i went online and it had gone on sale! i knew i had to have it. the large fit perfectly! i got so many compliments on the blouse. i wore it with skinny jeans and little boots! i couldn't be happier with this gorgeous blouse!",5
"I love this! great quality and flattering. i'd definitely agree that it runs true to size, as i had to size up because it was the only size available, and it is a little large in the stomach and rear, but it works well in the chest area. the v neck isn't too low and the sides provide good coverage up top. also, it covers the rear end well! material is nice and thick and the seams are good quality. super happy with this purchase, just wish it was in stock in the smaller size so it held me in more",5
"This is a truly exquisite top. it looks exactly as it does online with cascades of delicately embroidered flowers on front and back and a slightly ruffled neck. very chic and versatile with skirts or pants.
material is very light and chiffon like and it's fully lined so no need for a cami. it's ever so slightly see-through in the sections that are not embroidered but only in very intense light.
it fits tts, i usually get petite sizes but i got a xxs regular because i wanted a longer length and",5
"For sizing, i normally wear either xs or s in tops (i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, 34a). i tried on both, and both fit, but the arm holes were a little too tight on the xs. i ended up picking the s because it felt most comfortable. when i tried on the ivory color, i could see my blue bra underneath, and it would require a cami. the black didn't. i love the embroidered design and ruffled neck. i agree the buttons on the back of the neck are a tad difficult to button, but it's not a deterrent.",5
"I am absolutely in love with this bathing suit and i want it in every color possible! i bought the black one last year and wore it all summer as no other suit that i already owned could compare. i get compliments on it every where i go. it's flattering, comfy and it's a one piece that doesn't make me feel frumpy. buy this suit!",5
Perfect fit. though it is shear i found that i could wear it without a cami. i absolutely recommend this shirt. it fits tts.,5
"I got the floral suit and honestly, it's the most beautiful bathing suit i have ever owned. i have yet to wear it to the pool or beach so i don't know how it holds up when getting wet. i can see where other reviewers have said there is no support in the chest. it is padded which is nice, but no underwire or anything to hold the girls up. if you are big chested this could be an issue - not so much for me. :) looking forward to wearing this suit when the weather gets warmer!",5
"Ordered this on a whim, in my normal size large, and so glad i did. it's just beautiful. the color is a tea stained white background with soft grey blue and cinnamon colored tiny flowers. it has a soft, fairy princess vibe that could be dressy or casual. the 3/4 sleeves have elastic. it just flows nicely over the body and isn't oversized like so many tops. there's a ruffle with a slight peplum in the back. it's a beauty.",5
I absolutely love this tank. it goes great with a pair of jeans and cute booties. great colors and material. i love the nigh neck.,5
The sleeves are small. should buy a larger size than usual. other than this is perfect.,5
I bought this top for my sister's birthday so the review is based on her opinion. she loved it and told me the embroidery was beautiful. she said it was tts. she also stated that the blouse was so versatile and could be worn dressed up or down.,5
Love the look. love the fit for both professional and casual looks!!,5
"Such a beautiful pattern - i think you could wear it with a skirt and it wouldn't even read as a bathing suit. love the lacy pattern in front. great fit. i bought a medium, when i usually wear a small in retailer. it fits a little loose, so i'd probably buy a small if i bought another one, but it all depends on how you like your suits to fit.",5
"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and the xl in this blouse fit wonderfully. i bought the blouse in black, but will also probably purchase it in the cream. the blouse is made very nicely, however i had to deal with about 6 embroidered pieces that were not knotted. i had to take a needle, and thread the loose pieces to the back of the blouse and then knot them in with the rest of the embroidery. some of the individual flowers just came out entirely. however, this is such a stunning blouse and i feel so g",5
"I saw this top at my local retailer and instantly fell in love. i didn't even try it on first because i just ""knew"". when i finally got home and tried it on, it didn't disappoint. ultra feminine and sexy at the same time. the delicate high neck, coupled with the exposed cut in shoulders really sold this for me. then, you come to appreciate the beautiful sewn in flowers. loved this one....so much prettier in person than online.",5
"This swimsuit is amazing! i am 5' 4"" and about 135 lbs, and ordered a small. however, i am returning it for an extra small (just a personal preference as i like my swimsuits a bit snug so they don't get loose when wet). the fabric is very forgiving and stretchy (which is why i'm exchanging for a smaller size - i can slide the size small up my legs with ease), but the fabric is also very sturdy (so it seems, i haven't worn it in the water yet obviously). overall, very cute and surprisingly flatte",5
The neckline is very tight and itchy. the arm holes are deeply cut. the length is not as long in person as it is on the model in the picture. it's short-waisted. it's too bad because the embroidery is very pretty.,1
"Nice quality, beautiful colors. so nice i bought another as a gift.",5
"I bought this in june on a sale and am so glad that i did. it''s so pretty and classy. the neck has stretch so it's not tight at all. it's styled like a swing top, but it really isn't. there isn't much of a fabric abundance to this, although it is loose (and cool.) i bought an xl, which is my usual size and the fit is fine.

there are 2 layers of fabric. i do not think a cami is needed at all.

i bought this in black and the floral embroidery just pops! i'm just not a white fan due to cleani",5
"Simply perfect. i ordered the white floral maillot in a large (5'6""-ish, 145 pounds) and it is so comfortable and flattering that i do not want to take it off. the colors are so vibrant and accurate, which is great considering not all internet item photos are the same in person. i do recommend ordering a size up -- the medium was snug, but definitely remember that your suit shrinks when wet. now that they have a new print -- hello fish!! -- i really really want another!",5
"I love this blazer so much i bought it in both colors. i'm 5'7"", 120 pounds and bought the size 4 which is perfect. initially when i tried it on in the store i thought i needed the 6 because it was a little tight in the arms and shoulders. the 6 was too boxy on me and i'm so glad i went with the 4. it stretched, especially the arms, and fits perfect. i love how i can dress this down (with a graphic tee and jeans) or dress up (with a blouse and cropped black pants).",5
"This top is absolutely adorable, i cannot express how much i love it. paired with skinny jeans and a bright cardi for the spring, this can easily transition into summer. it's actually cuter irl than in the picture. if you are on the fence about this, get it! you won't regret it.",5
"This has been my go to top every time i go out lately. i just make sure i am with different people. the length is perfect and not too long. i wear a strapless black bra and you cannot see through the shirt. the only thing i don't like about it, is the three buttons in the back at the top are very, very difficult to button.",5
"The embroidery is breathtaking. it is more flattering and interesting in person. i would highly recommend it!. it is true to size, figure flattering, and unique. the only reason i gave it four stars for quality is because the neck is a little itchy. if you are looking for a show stopper and conversation piece, this is it!",5
"I have a large cup size and year after year i am in the search of the perfect suit that supports, but doesn't look matronly. this year i had a baby and wanted to move to a one piece, but still wanted to feel sexy and youthful. i thought there is no way this suit is going to look good and/or support a 34ff, but gave it try because of all the 5 star reviews. i tried it on and my husband just said ""wow!"" this suit hugs you in all the right places and actually supports - i don't know how, but it doe",5
"I had been hearing about this dress for months and was so excited to see they brought it back in more colors. the reviews i read claimed it runs small in the chest area. i'm a true pear shape (23b, i normally wear - size 2, xs, on top and size 4-6 on the bottom, but with dresses i almost always get size 2) because of the swing a nature of the dress i decided to size down with this one. i was nervous how tight it would be up top but i also didn't want it to look like inwas wearing a sack! so i to",5
"Love this top! cloth & stone makes excellent quality clothes that are durable and have unique details. this top can go with many different looks and i can't wait to take it out for a spin!

i bought the medallion crops to go with this top and it is an awesome combo, i would definitely check it out!",5
"Comfortable, stretchy fabric; both colors are beautiful",5
"This coat is wonderful. it's boxy and drapes really nicely. the colors are beautiful and versitile. i love the pockets. the fabric is sturdy, but not heavy. i have nothing but good things to say about this coat. i had to return it, sadly, since it wasn't flattering on my hourglass shape. (i am 5'6"", 34dd-27-42 and the small fit well) if you're confident enough to hide your waste, go for it. your won't regret it.",5
I love this skirt!! i'm trying to find the perfect place to wear it :),5
I ordered my usual size; however when it arrived it appeared to fit a 9 year old! the color and style are adorable. i will need to exchange it for 2 sizes larger! i am so shocked at maeve's sizing.,5
"I just received this top and love it. the fabric is soft and comfy. it is just as pictured, no surprises. lace-up fronts are a hot item for spring. for reference, i am 5'7 and weigh #127. the xs fits perfectly.",5
"I thought, this is nice, when it was a new arrival i put it in my wish lsit as i liked how the cut looked on the modl. but i dind't think i would love it as much on me (i ordered it when it hit sale#. the material is ""fluffy"", and has a shimmer you can't see on the online picture. one of hte thread will need to be cut, but no biggie, it is so ute. the beading is also very subtle, but pretty. my stylist #brught it in t try onin the store# loved it somuch she is ordering one for herself. the cut i",5
This is such a unique piece and could be dressed up or down. i can see myself wearing this with skinny jeans and a tee and adding a statement necklace or wearing over a dress. i tend to get hot so i like how light weight this is even though it is lined. it is of excellent quality but may run slightly small (or at least smaller than other items i have purchased through retailer). the drape is extremely flattering and i think that would be true for every figure. my favorite feature is the oversized,5
"I love this dress! splurged while i was doing my christmas shopping to get this for myself, and i'm so glad i did! it's such a comfortable dress - stretchy and not too thin or too heavy of a fabric. it pairs well with tights and a long cardigan in the winter, or on it's own with a statement necklace. style and fit are great - this dress is super flattering,",5
This is an awesome go to for dressy or casual! wore it with booties for a dinner and flats for temple and was perfect for both! lace is a little delicate but worth the extra care!,5
"This top is gorgeous and flattering for spring. the fit is beautiful. one thing - i find that the seam that goes across the stomach does chafe a little bit. however, with a light tank underneath this is no issue at all and the top is well worth it.",5
"Love this jacket! this picture shows the sleeves rolled down, but in the stores they have them rolled up and i have to say that is how you'll most likely wear it as the sleeves might be too short if you rolled them down. however, it is still a fabulous fall coat! it does run slightly large, but it depends on how you want it to fit. i am typically a medium, and i bought the m/l because the xs/s was a little fought in the shoulders. i bought last weekend and already wore twice because it looks gre",5
"I love this skirt! the color is beautiful, much darker than in the photo. the only issue i have is with the length. it's much longer in real life. i'm definitely going to need to have it shortened.",5
Fits great and the material feels great on! going to buy a second one in a different pattern.,5
"This is an awesome blouse! it is well made. the fabric is thick and soft. it drapes beautifully. i love the tie at the top. i wish it came in other colors - other than the denim offered. i am 5'4"", 115 pounds, flat chested. the xs fit well.",5
"The online picture does not do this top justice. much cuter in person. soft and so comfortable. got this in my usual xs. paired with a white ""fluffy"" sweater and jeans to wear to a casual charity event. hope they do more of this top in other colors.",5
"Love this jacket. you will definitely want to size down though. i am usually a medium/large, but i was swimming in that size. i opted for the xs/s, and it is perfect.",5
"I bought this top on a whim - it's not 100% my style, but wanted to try something different. the fabric and print are amazing! so unique, soft, subtle, and delicate. great fit as well. my only complaint is not the fault of the top, but if you have a bit of tummy, the fold at the peplum really brings it out so you'd have to wear high-waisted bottoms or suck it in. the hem is also really flowy, more so than shown in the pictures. theres a lot of fabric so it kind of ruffles more at the bottom rath",5
Tops are a challenge for me. i am top heavy so i often have to size up to avoid pulling in the bust. this one is not over sized in the bust but i am able to open the laceing for a little more wiggle room but still not look like i am wearing a tent. fabric is wonderful. it is not too thin and not too thick.? it does pull up slightly in the wash. it requires a little ironing or a good steaming.,5
"This duster is light weight - good for a inside a chilly restaurant, but not really warm enough for cold outdoor winter weather.

really punches up a black on black outfit. polished, artsy, interesting look. runs large. has a feel similar to a swing coat - with less swing.

i've received many compliments on this piece. wear it with confidence - it is on the bold side.",5
"This coat is a classic! i would wear it every day if it wasn't so distinct. very comfortable, flattering, and stylish.",5
"I really love this dress. it's very flattering for all body types - i'm 5'4"", 120 and i purchased a small. it also looks really cute with a stretchy belt. in the picture - it doesn't show this, but it has these cute snap sleeves that adds some great detail. it's also very comfortable. it is a thin material, so for those looking for a thicker fabric - this may not be the right dress. loved it!",5
"Love this! perfect in the summer with bright, strappy heels or sandals or booties in the winter.",5
"I saw this in the sales section today and was drawn to it by the color and style. i really didn't think it'd fit on me, even though the only size available was a size 12, because it looked like a sheath-type dress that's more body hugging, and usually such dresses just don't work well on my wider hips and hourglass frame. howeverl here's what i thought:

- beautiful blush pink. it looks exactly the same in person as online.
- very comfortable as the other reviewer mentioned. t",5
"-this was actually at my local retailer store. it reminded me of another online exclusive that was a dress and had the same flower shapes but the color was a soft pink; this is exactly like that.

pros:
- it is so lovely with the pleated front",5
"Love this henely, the lace-up is cute. the shirt is comfy. so versatile. beach coverup or over jeans",5
"I have had my eye on this dress since the spring (in yellow), but it sold out quickly. i jumped on this dress as soon as i saw it come out in different colors this fall! i purchased the peach color and it is really lovely. i will be wearing this dress for family photos. the lace and the details are so very pretty! i am usually a size 0 or 2, and purchased in size 2 since there is no stretch to it. it is a beautiful dress and i highly recommend it! wish it came in white!",5
"Now i would've been scared off by the fabrics had i not seen the cute, flattering cut if this spring top. love the futuristic look of the fabric and style brought back by the rise design throughout. like the previous reviewer claims, this top is even cuter on us non models (who are pry not as washed out). the color combo is another positive because it's both flattering and versatile!",5
Beautiful. elegant. sexy. i love the fit. can be dressed up or wear with jeans. it's great!,5
"I love simple, comfortable tops with interesting details and one that i can easily throw on without much fuss. this top is made for people like me!!! the ribbed knit is super soft without being too thin, the lace is quite pretty without being too delicate. normally, tops like this have the lace portion sewn to the hem but this top actually has a whole layer of lace under the knit outer shell. so, it's like wearing a layer of lace and ribbed sweater on top of the lace. the good news is, the lace",5
"Love the simple non-fussy style of this dress. note that the color is not ivory, as described and expected (not the first time retailer makes that mistake), however i still found the oatmealish-warm beige color to be flattering to my skin tone (warm tones look best on me). like that the shoulders are covered while still feeling sleeveless, gives it a dressier feel. the fine texture is lovely. this does drape up top, while the bottom clings a bit, but not overly much for me to feel immodest. i am 5",5
"True to size, nice unique shoulder/neckline fit and blousey/full on the bottom and arms which taper in. for me, i prefer to wear it tucked or partially tucked in to add waist definition. though a vest or belt can also be used. sheer, you will need a cami. lovely flow and colors., the collar,pleats and neck tie add a romantic interest. just beautiful.",5
"Great jean! i will live in these this winter. so flattering, bum looks good, leg is slender and lengthening. perfect petite jean with a flared leg.",5
"Great tee for layering, love the sweet lace along the bottom. the lace lines the entire body of the tee and it's a little thin so i prefer a cami underneath but a nude bra would be invisible. i usually wear a small, sometimes an xs, and the small fits like it does on the model.",5
"I saw this classic beauty on a mannequin with black trousers, and it looks gorgeous so i went back to try it on! looks better on vs on the table
i have broad shoulders and the small worked",5
"Love, love, love!
this is true retailer! the color is lovely and it's so soft! i love the seams in the back and the overall ""raw seam"" style.",5
"I received this top today and though the color is not white as shown in the pic, it's a beautiful top. its more ivory as mentioned. the lace is like a lining(covering the entire body except the arms) underneath the ribbed fabric. like the other reviewer mentioned the lace is not itchy but soft and very pretty! i totally love it!!! this is my new favorite top in my wardrobe!!",5
"This is no exception to the rule! i love turtlenecks and this one is going to be a favorite. do know that this is not lightweight-even though this is sleeveless it is definitely a substantial knit. the color is a beautiful nutmeg and can be dressed up or down. i purchased a gorgeous neutral beaded necklace to go with it and it is simply stunning! it does 'bell out' a little at the bottom which, in my opinion-is the only design flaw. i normally wear a medium in most retailer tops and the small is a",5
"This is a very pretty blouse with a vintage, romantic looking fabric. the tiny pleats near the neck and shoulders are lovely. i love the colors...black, brown, and cream. it's hard to find a top that can be worn well with both black and brown. the long tie adds a romantic feel. this blouse is totally sheer so requires a cami or tank. i actually love the blouse, but returned it because it is super blousy. i am 5'2"", 140 lbs., and the small was fine. it is just so blousy, that even belting it didn",5
This is a great layering piece. took it on a trip and wore with both a long sleeve and tank under it. is more 'khaki' color then the photo shows - which was a goo thing for me.,5
"Love, love, love this dress. you can dress it up with high heels, or down with sandals . a mid weight material with seperate slip that serves as a lining . i am athletic , 5' 7"" and 132 lbs and bought a size small. i have broad shoulders , average waist , short torso , small hips and long legs. in the spring a denim jacket would look perfect with this dress.",5
I can't stop wearing this. it's perfect for layering! the fit is great-loose but not a bag. i love that it's a wide open knit.,5
"It took me a while to finally try this on after seeing it in store for a while, i wasn't sure about the color. then i saw it matched with the brush stroke charlie trousers (which i had just purchased) and loved the combination so much i had to finally try it. i love the fit and feel of this top. i agree with a poster before that the photo does not do this top justice. my only wish is that t was a touch longer.",5
"I am super-pleased with this cardigan, which is at a terrific sale price. i saw this in the pink color in the state street retailer in chicago, and i loved the feel of the material but wasn't sure about the color for me. when i saw they had a neutral striped version online, i decided to get it. the material is very soft and the beige/neutral color has a gray undertone which is good for my skintone. the front is double-layered and it has a fun seaming detail in the back and an ""unfinished"" trim whi",5
"The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality, and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit, immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.",1
"It's hard to tell how jeans will fit when shopping online. i was very pleasantly surprised. they are super soft, very high quality and look even better in person. i'm 5'3 118 lbs and i ordered the 27p and may have to get them taken up an inch, but they fit perfectly through the hips and come in at the knee. i'm big in the hips and small in the waist and they fit perfectly. highly recommend for petites out there!",5
I have this tank in all colors...it is superb for layering...comfortable and i love that you can reverse it for a different neckline...and it's long enough!,5
"I'm 5'1 and 110 pounds and i ordered the 26 petite. the jeans are fabulous...flattering....comfortable...i could go on and on. the fabric is super soft and the fit hugs in all the right places. it is a nice flare bottom. i will have to wear these with heels or wedges, they are too long for flats.",5
"I like that i can wear this over anything, only drawback is that it's short-sleeved so it semi-defeats the purpose of having a cardigan but- it's so pretty i can't return it!",5
"The fabric is really soft and the cardi has a cute and comfy slouchy, loose fit. reminds me of free people cardis with the extra long sleeves and loose fit. great to throw on over workout clothes or with jeans and a tee shirt. easy piece. would size down. i'm getting lots of use out of it.",5
"I highly recommend this top. i am busty and was concerned that it might not be flattering. but i find it flattering. i also don't have the greatest arms, so i wore a crisp white top underneath. see my pics below. hides any tummy pooch and is so flattering. runs tts. i ordered a small. i'm 5' 120 lbs. the petite might have been too short for my taste. don't hesitate!",5
"I love the style of this top, there's good stretch to the fabric so it's very flattering. the length is good for me, as the previous review stated, it's a little long but for me it's lengthening. the lace is lovely, too. i'll wear it with some white jeans for summer.",5
Very light weight and soft fabric. i bought the blue but did not try green or grey. i love blue with my skin tone and am afraid green may make my skin look yellow. did not see the green in my store though. very comfy and flattering dress. runs tts.,5
Great sweater coat! i bought the camel color and it looks so good over all black. it runs large. i usually buy a medium in sweaters but his one i bought the small. it is very unique and a cool take on a peacoat.,5
"I bought this dress in the green color and i am absolutely in love with it!! it is very figure flattering and looks great even though i have a larger bust. it is also a great length, hits about an inch or two above the knee. highly recommend!!!",5
"I have wanted a boiled wool jacket for years. finally. i got the gray/navy. soft, warm and classic. i expect it to last forever. it is the right weight for out door wear in warmer climates or late fall/early spring in minnesota. the sleeves are long, but push up nicely, and roomy enough to go over a long sleeved blouse. i paired it with the tartan charlie trousers, and it is very polished for work. soft. but someone sensitive to wool might find it itchy. i agree that it is a little boxy--but i t",5
"I am not sure where all of the other reviews on these pants went, but when i ordered mine, there were mostly all good reviews. i absolutely love these lounge pants. someone mentioned that they thought they were a little itchy where the lace is but while they may not be the softest pants ever, they are certainly very comfortable, not itchy at all. i am 5'6"""" 140 lbs and i ordered the medium. the fit was a little snug at first but, as i wore them, they stretched and loosened. i also wear them with",5
"I bought this jacket in the grey blue color and i absolutely love it. it is warm an sophisticated and versatile. i am 5'4"" and 160 lbs and the medium was good for me.",5
"The first day i wore this jacket to work, three people told me how great it looked. it's stylish but comfy, looks great worn with a tunic and leggings or accompanying a skirt and tights. best of all, the camel color is a great change from black and as a bonus, doesn't show my orangeish lab's dog hair!",5
"Great jacket! warm as a coat yet thin enough to wear indoors. i dress up with a fitted dress, or dress down with jeans. very versatile and comfortable. i always get compliments on it.",5
"I saw this online and thought the idea was super cute, but was not sure if it would be worth the money because it looks typical. but, when i went to the store to try it on, i saw it was anything but typical. the fit is perfect and the fabric so soft. i wanted the dress in the green, but they were already sold out in my size at the store, so i had to order it online. i cannot wait until it comes in! i will wear this often during the summer.",5
I love this sweater. it is a beautiful color and i love the boxy shape. very soft.,5
Love love love...the fit is amazing and truly well made. this jumpsuit is a classic and it fits perfectly. i just wish the button was a little bit more secure but other than that it's a 10,5
Lightweight warm in cold nice as a day jacket. works well as a casual coat. very soft but a little wooly. it's really nice color. thinking about buying another. i got the dark one.,5
"Soft fabric, waistband is flat no vpl!lace trim cuts in a bit for a little vpl- but still nice lightweight, barely there but full coverage. would buy again!",5
Love this jacket - got it in the charcoal color. i especially enjoy the collar and the handy pockets.,5
"I love this dress. it's cool and comfortable in this crazy heat! the fabric has a great feel to it. i do wish it was just a little longer.. 

(i'm 5'8"", 145#, and bought a medium)",5
I'm 5'8 140 lbs and small worked perfectly. great dress!,5
This is such a perfect tee to wear on cold days! it's a fall/winter/spring staple for sure. it's very soft and falls perfectly. i would definitely recommend it.,5
"This dress might be the most comfortable article of clothing i own, especially for the hot summers. it is attractively loose, and so light that you barely feel like you are wearing it. love it!",5
I love this jacket and have worn it to work with a deep chocolate brown t-neck and straight leg pants. i get a lot of compliments on it. i am happy that the double breasting does not bulk up my silouette as that can happen with the style. the boiled wool is fine quality without being thick. the color is true to what is shown. the fit is perfect and what i expected. i highly recommend the purchase.,5
This dress is so cute and comfy! i purchased it for my friend's wedding brunch celebration - perfect transitional piece!,5
"I was trying on the cream knit turtleneck midi dress in the store, and wanted the shearling vest shown with it to work for me. the dress is sleeveless, very good looking on, but the vest on me was too much, looked like i was being swallowed by a huge shearling taco. i wanted and needed something to stay warm in without the bulk of a full coat. the stylist brought me this jacket, and it was just the thing for me. its classic and modern, warm without bulk, and the two tone complimented the dress a",5
"I'm 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress. one of these beauties ended up in our store and i had to try it on. the sleeves are no joke - serious bell sleeves that could have looked comical with the polka dots, but is surprisingly chic. the one i purchased was a medium - never had an opportunity to try a small, which i suspect is my actual size. buying it oversized made this magical. it feels modern. i actually think because the whole sweater is oversized on me, it makes the sleeves less cartoonish.",5
Lucky enough to have the chance to try this on in the store! the sleeves are not big,5
"This is my favorite dress purchase so far in 2016. the fabric feel and thickness is wonderful. it flares out a little but not too much. order the size that matches your largest measurement on the size chart for bust and waist, - or if you have broad shoulders, the larger of your typical size range. i'm typically a 00p or a 0p, with a 00p hip measurement, a middle range (00p is 24, 0p is 25) waist measument (24.5) and a 00p bust measurement, but my shoulders are broad and athletic. 0p, the larger",5
"I love my new dress! it is comfy, classy and so easy to wear! you can dress it up or down with ease. i'm looking forward to seeing more styles from this designer. i hope soon!! don't miss out on this dress. it's a must have for your wardrobe!",5
"I have been looking for a summer dress with a bit of a chic flair to it- i was thinking black, tank top dress. after weeks of hunting for the idea in my head, i started to branch out. i reluctantly tried this on thinking it would be 'baggish', plain, and possibly too short. wow was i wrong!! this dress is everything + more. wear with some wedges, belt it (although it doesn't need it at all!), layer a high neckline lace top over it, the possibilities are endless. although i loved the green, the b",5
"Gorgeous pattern and colors for autumn. maeve does me good when it comes to maxi dresses. i have to say that the sizing is all over the place! i am generally a medium, but the small and xs (?!) fit me well also. the stretchiness of the jersey is very comfortable and forgiving, except at the ruched waistband, which took longer to stretch out, but it did eventually. i do need to hem if i want to wear flats, but the length works for my higher heels. there are pockets and a lining to my knees. i am",5
"I love boiled wool paired with classic silhouettes and this bonette combines best of both. the fabric is soft, not too substantial but still warm for my climate, goes great with many outfit combinations, has a flexible cut for my body type. i chose to to buy the size small and while it's a little tight in the upper sleeves (because my upper arms are chubby) i can work with it when i wear the right top. the medium was a just a bit too boxy for the profile i wanted but i may get it any way in the",5
Completely versatile and absolutely perfect for days when my pea coat is too heavy. looks amazing with jeans or with slacks for work. i highly recommend this jacket!,5
This boiled wool jacket is warm and cozy. it does run a little big. i have to fold the sleeves twice! but it looks great and i got compliments immediately.,5
Stylish or comfy - often the choice when looking for casual but not with this top! it's comfy and cozy and stylish to boot. the sleeves are fun and create a nice line of interest. you can pair this with jeans for a casual day or dress it up with slacks and heels and be comfy either way.,5
"This top looks beautiful online. when i got it, it looks nothing like the pic. it's wide, too much fabric, no shape and so unflattering. it's definitely going back",1
"I fell in love with this sweater as soon as i saw it. i was a little unsure what the quality would be like just from the photos, but i went ahead and ordered it and it is even more amazing in person. it's super soft and well made. it's also very warm even though it has such a large open weave. the price is definitely higher than i would normally pay, but this is a piece that will stay in your closet, and wardrobe rotation for years and years. definitely worth the investment. i agree with the pre",5
"Lovely socks, great color, stitched well, a little thin",5
I went a size down on this top. it was to billowy in my regular size. it has the elastic waist but it was bunching up too much in that area. i love the embroidery. . it is gorgeous. . will have to hand wash for sure.,5
I was really disappointed when i tried this top on. the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off. the cut of the top overall was just off.,1
Very unflattering and no shape or flair. lots of extra material but no swing or shape. do not recommend.,1
"I love the idea of this top, but there is just way too much fabric involved in person! i'm 5'2 and usually wear a small or medium to accommodate a fuller chest. i ordered a small and it fit fine around the chest but the huge swing hem combined with the slightly stiff fabric is just enormously unflattering. i feel like they could have made about 3 shirts out of it. i think the picture must have it pinned a ton in the back, the silhouette is nothing like shown. if there were just less fabric, i wo",1
"I tried on the xs in store, and loved it. stylist said i need xs petite, but otherwise, it looks great. the cut is flattering, the neckline is a tad higher and almost has a mini cowl. the colors are neutral and would love to wear with a nice pair of dark flared pants. or skinnies. so at 115 lbs, 30dd, i would go with xs petite( i am below 5'2""). fabric is very soft too...",5
"Had to have these when i saw them online. usually an ag girl, but loved the button fly and boyfriend fit. originally ordered a 28 and returned for a 27. after a couple of wears, wish i bought the 26. a must have!",5
I love these jeans . i have a few pairs of citizen jeans and like the way they fit . these are a slim boyfriend jean - not too baggy - very flattering with any top - loose or tight fitting . wish retailer carried the white .,5
"I bought this top last week and absolutely love it! it hides my muffin top and falls in all the right places. it does not cling, but is very flattering for my size 12-14 body.",5
"Coh emerson style jeans are the best fit and style. the ""pacifica"" color is a light blue and nice for spring and summer. i love the slim boyfriend. i have thighs and they fit like a skinny without being super tight. there is just enough stretch. no holes either. they are easy to dress up or down and have become my new favorites.",5
This is a darling dress at this price point. i tried some of the more expensive options in the off-the-shoulder dresses this season and this one is as flattering and as well constructed as the others. the fabric is light but it is not sheer. it is smooth with a bit of a sheen. it is airy but not drapey like a rayon would be. i would describe it as a lawn. upon arrival the packaging indicated that it is considered a 'cover-up'. the site did not describe it that way but it may explain the comparat,5
"Love, love, love this top. so flattering and forgiving. bought it in white - great for summer!",5
I love this shirt!!! i ordered a medium and the sleeves were very long and the shirt was wide in general. i returned it for a small and it is perfect. size down! i love the comfy gauzy feel of this shirt.,5
"I am a loyal retailer shopper, but find many items are hit or miss. this definitely is a hit especially in black! i am 5'4"" 125 lbs and 36ddd. i usually take a m or m petite in retailer tops. because this is flowy and long, a s petite fits perfectly. the style is one-of-a-kind, the lace is heavy and top quality, and when you try on the right size, it hits perfectly. the lavender is a dusty shade that won't work well in fall/winter. it would look wonderful in cranberry or forest green.",5
"This top doesn't at all fit like it does on the model. the mid section is very wide and boxy and the material is thick and almost sweatshirt-like. i typically wear size small or 4, but perhaps an xs might've fit or looked better. sadly i must return this shirt.",1
"I usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue.  i am 5'2"", 120#, broad shoulders.  i ordered both the sp & the mp.  i tried on the small petite first and it was too tight in the shoulders/arm (that was without lifting my arms forward or up).  i tried on the mp and it was perfect!  i would have to say this is my favorite fall top so far!  the color is very pretty . . .more of a lavender than pink.  the lace detail is delicate and pretty.  the top is more like a tunic, get the petite if you short",5
"I love peasant shirts so wanted to try it. cute top, but v-neck was lower than i was expecting. i have to wear an undershirt under this for that and also because of sheerness. fyi- shirt is off-white so stark white cami didn't work. was struggling to find something, but have the leana v-neck in navy- worked perfect and follows neckline exactly. now really cute! need something not long sleeves to wear under for spring weather here, but will keep and try to figure it out. 5'4, 135 lbs, ordered xs.",5
"I've been waiting for this to go on sale, and just picked one up in store. the details and style of this blouse do not disappoint! since it's billowy in nature, a size smaller fits me perfectly.",5
This top has really beautiful lace detail. the color is much deeper pink than the picture online. i ordered the xs petite and it fits fine but i like my tops longer so i wish i had gotten the regular xs instead. it is very pretty!,5
"I really wanted to love this top, but there is way too much fabric. it looks nothing like the pictures. it was more like a maternity top vs. a swingy top. i'll be returning this one.",1
I bought this top in white. i wore it with black skinny crop jeans. it is very cute and flattering. the length is just so that it makes the swing top flattering without is bring too overwhelming. i received lots of compliments. the quality is great and the top washed up well too. love it. for reference. i'm 5'5' 125 lbs and bought the top in small.,5
"I saw this peasant blouse online and thought it looked cute, but not really enough to spend the money on. i purchased a few other things instead. i happened to go into the store to see a different top in person and spotted this one. it is definitely cuter in person. as with most tops like this, it is baggy and loose. however, probably due to the elastic at the bottom, this one doesn't look overly big and shapeless. just a pretty top that will be perfect for spring. for reference, i am 5'6 115, a",5
"I keep trying to find a peplum that works for me, but so far i have been unsuccessful. i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together?aside from the peplum issue, this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large. the material alone is thick, making it a bulkier shirt, then add the volume of the peplum and i looked (and felt) huge. needless to say, this one was returned, sale or no sale.",1
"Did not work for me. whatsoever. the stripes were adorable but the piece just didn't fit like on the model. the collar was practically choking me and the tie just didn't make my figure look the way it normally does. aka i looked frumpy and chunky, which i'm not. going back.",1
So this may be my least favorite thing i have ever bought from retailer. this top had so much extra material it was like wearing a bag or parachute. it looked a million times cuter in the photos.,1
It is the perfect shirt that looks and feels great. i wear a size 4 and it fits perfectly.,5
"This shirt fits beautifully, though might be tight for the large chested. the fabrics is very soft, and the look classic and feminine.",5
Every so often the perfect pair of bottoms comes along. this style was it for me. i'm tall 5'9 so the length fits perfect for a crop wide leg trouser. i will be able to wear these in the summer as they are light weight enough and also into fall before it gets too cold. can't wait to wear them. extra bonus i got them on sale. if you are short these will probably be more like a long leg trouser on you. also fit true to size.,5
"Can't say enough about these pants.
i often find leggings to be to revealing when wearing them with long but not long enough top. i have a longer torso so finding tops that hit this sweet spot is an issue for me. i also don't love long flowy tops with jeans all the time. the portions look all off and i look and feel heavy in my middle section.
cue these darlings! with out any buttons, zippers on the front your shirts will lay flat and crisp. i feel comfortable and appropriate at my causal work o",5
"I love this suit, the bottoms ran a bit too big on me. i'm usually a small, but an extra small would have fit more comfortably. the small wasn't huge, so i kept with them and im still very happy with this purchase.",5
"I purchased these bottoms with the matching peplum top in romantic floral. i also purchased the higher waisted bottoms just in case. 
i returned the higher bottoms and that's saying a lot. 
i have two sons and now struggle with fit in regard to two piece bathing suits. 
the higher bottoms just didn't fit right and i didn't need the extra coverage because these fit so well and the peplum gives extra coverage, though not really necessary. 
the others cut in a bit in the seat and hips and these",5
"Oh how i dread online shopping for bikinis...especially bottoms. however, these bottoms are incredible. the fit is perfect. you know when you are wearing normal underwear and you ask yourself... ""why can't bathing suit bottoms just fit like this?"" these bikini bottoms do! you can't tell by the picture but they are a really great weight...not too thick and bulky...very flattering...perfect rear coverage...doesn't pinch your sides.truly the most flattering bottoms i've found in a long time. worth",5
"This shirt is so soft and luxuriously feeling. the material looks very nice and seems well made. it has a nice length to it, so it can be worn properly with leggings without any worry. i'm a 36d and can't get the button to close properly, so i'd recommend sizing up if this could be an issue for you. overall it will be a very versitile piece i'm excited to add to my wardrobe.",5
I love white blouses in the summer. this one is perfect. bought one size down and it is perfect. the lovely tailored neck is very flattering and hard to find. i do send it to the cleaners just to make sure it keeps that crisp cool look for hot summer days.,5
"I'm so glad i bought this. the picture doesn't do it justice. it's lightweight, flowy and super comfy. i'll be wearing this all the time. very lightweight so it doesn't get hot. love the material, it's soft, light and flattering! color says light grey but it does have a bit of a blue/lavender hue to it as another reviewer said. i love cloth & stone and this is one of my favorites! well worth the money!",5
"Ordered in my normal size large and i love it. beautiful fit. striking pattern that's quite slimming. the stripes are deep chocolate next to a mauve purple gray on a white background. it looks black so lots of colors would work on top. the fabrication is a soft rib knit and it has a substantial elastic waistband. it overlaps in the front and the opening falls a bit  high so that may be a deal breaker for some because it does expose some upper thigh. i like the look but i'm 5'3"" so it works well",5
"Love the material -- it is a thick cotton, but it is structured enough and thick enough so that it doesn't cling to me (in a bad way). its like wearing a sweater. my only beef with it is that the seam where the black material is stitched to the gray material creates a bump in the silhouette. (the black material is the same as the gray and it also has a herringbone pattern thats not really visible in the pictures) i would have preferred a uniform material rather than a panel sewn in. not a huge d",5
"These bottoms are comfortable, soft and fit perfectly. the pattern is exactly the colors online.",5
"Best part: covers my bum. perfect for teaching, casual girls' night or casual date night.  my only complaint is there aren't other colors. awful decision. i would have purchased at least 5 of these at the right price.",5
So soft and comfortable!,5
"This is a comfortable and easy shirt that is meant to be slightly looser. i wear a size small in all cloth and stone and found this shirt to be true to size. the extra small was too tight in the shoulders and didn't have the right look to it.

same fabric as my other cloth and stone items, however, i had to steam the cuffed sleeves and back pleating after washing and drying to make it look nice and crisp. also, the cuffed sleeves are sewn that way, which i like.",5
"Granted that i am not as reed thin, or as young, as the model. but i am tall and reasonably slender. i have long hands and small wrists, which would be a factor in the overall effect of this garment. this poncho looked like some sad old stretched out who-knows-what that you'd keep in the car for emergency purposes, in case you needed warmth if the car broke down in a snowstorm -- and i have one of those foldable reflective blankets in the glove box for that purpose. i was looking for a statement",1
"I saw this sweater on-line and loved it until i tried it on. i'm 5-7, flat chested, 135 pounds and i ordered a size small. the sweater fit everywhere except for my arms. this sweater will work great if you are short. consider making your sweaters a little longer, because i do not consider myself tall.",1
"What a special skirt. so beautiful, great quality. i got on sale, but still expensive . . and it was still worth it. i will be wearing this for years!",5
"Just bought red today to wear to a conference to stay warm over floreat peasant blouse and pilcro serif jeans. love love!! very flattering and plan to wear with skirts, on airplanes for warmth and for travel. very versatile . highly recommend .",5
"I bought this top in all four colors. soft material, elegant design, relaxed fit- a true staple for every closet!",5
This top fits so well and looks much better on than in the picture.,5
Love this medium weight wool cape. it is so much prettier in person. the photos look a bit boring but this cape is very versatile and simple to wear. some capes hang oddly on me but this one was flattering without the bulk. not itchy either. the photos don't really show the sleeves clearly but there is a sleeve built into the cape. the taupe color is a rich neutral that can be paired with thin or thicker turtlenecks or shirts. the sleeves are bracelet length so full length sweaters will show und,5
"I saw this sweater and just about died. i loved the accentuated shoulders and beautiful knit detail on the sleeves. lucky for me, retailer day started a couple of days after this sweater debuted, and i snagged it right away. i just got it and am in love. it fits true to size and the shoulders and sleeves are everything i hoped they would be. the neckline in very flattering as well. it is soft and the color is gorgeous. if there is a negative, it would be that it is a bit boxy in the torso, and doe",5
"As is true of a bunch of the fall clothing photos, the colors are totally washed out in these model images which is such a shame. the embroidery is bright and vivid and totally unique on this! the bib area is actually a soft corduroy which i think is nice to transition into fall and winter. in terms of fit, i do feel like this is maybe geared more towards the slender build - it is a slim cut which i found really flattering for me since i sometimes swim in tunics. at 5'7"", 128# with a very small",5
"I've had my eye on this poncho for weeks and finally scored the olive green one over thanksgiving/black friday special. i would say the color is more mustard yellow, which will go well with a variety of jewel-tone tops, etc. the poncho is a nice weight, but not too heavy. i am 4""11 with short arms, but i went ahead and bought the regular xs instead of the petite sizes and the length is perfect. i am seriously considering getting the cranberry one as well. a classic buy for winter which i'm sure",5
"This is such a fun pullover sweater! i'm not much for sweaters, so i thought this would be a neat alternative. im between a small and medium, so i went with the small due to the swing style. it fit wonderfully! i'm even happy with the length which completely covers my behind (i'm 5'6""). i choose the gray and it's a great neutral, but now i'm contemplating going back for the red as well! hopefully a promo will come along soon!",5
Love this top-that simple,5
"Originally got one with a stain. retailer quickly sent a replacement,
useful with many skirts and pants. well made.",5
"I initially bought this in the stone color and loved it so much the first time i wore it that i went back for the red. without a doubt my favorite purchases of the season. have gotten so many compliments on both and despite the fact that the style isn't form fitting, it is still somehow very flattering. would highly recommend this sweater to anyone!",5
"These jeans are so great, i'm thinking of getting a second pair for when the first wear out, despite the price. they hug my curves and make me feel like a bombshell. the fabric and stitching is all good quality and sturdy - these are comfy but they definitely are not thin like legging jeans. love them!",5
Looks and fits just like the picture. fabric is nice and soft. looking forward to wearing this tunic as soon as the weather cools just a little,5
"I bought this in rose and i really like the jacket. the color is not rose but the picture is accurate. it is more terra cotta as previous reviewer's said. it is pretty casual but you can dress it up with a chunky necklace and dressy boots. i do wish it was a tad more fitted in the waist. i think it looks better buttoned, but i do wear it open as well.",5
"I bought this in purple and then just now in navy.i love the sleeve length and neckline. this shirt is made of a very soft knit material a so its very comfy and flattering. goes well with jeans, shirts and shorts. i definitely recommend purchasing this shirt.",5
First saw this poncho on a petite blog and after reading reviews happily paid full price. i followed the petite reviews and purchased the xs regular. the length hits right below my bum so it's perfectly structured to wear with leggings. the cable knit is super soft and very warm. wore this for the first time last weekend layered over a long sleeve tee and was perfectly cozy outside for a fall day in chicago. this item will not last long and is well worth paying full price.,5
"The dress i received was not in the least what i was expecting, and in the best way possible. i initially purchased the dress as something i could wear to work, but when i put it on, it was clear the dress was meant for something a bit more fun. it's more along the lines of a sweater dress and is very flattering and chic.",5

"I fell in love with this tunic on instagram, and couldn't wait to find it during the tops promotion. it was absolutely not a disappointment. as the other reviewer mentioned, the colors of the embroidery are brighter than they appear in the online images, and this actually makes the shirt more beautiful--they're rich and fallish, but not at all over the top.

i'm thrilled with the quality and overall cut of this tunic. i would agree that it might be best to run to a larger size in a range--i di",5

"Nice fit, wish it was a little longer but i really do like it and feel good when i wear it",5
Love this top! runs true to size. exactly as pictured.,5
"Adorable jacket. i ordered the medium (5'4, 135 lbs). sleeves are long and have to roll them up. ordering the petite medium to see if it fits better. pink color is great.",5
"So soft. a casual tunic, yet polished and interesting enough for work. darker blue than the photo, and the colors are much brighter and prettier in person.",5
"I purchased this sweater at my local retailer store a few weeks ago. i picked the dark grey color which is more of a neutral beige or oatmeal color. i love it! i just wish i had purchased it earlier to wear through the fall. it has a substantial weight and is warm. this sweater/poncho has a great drape that is really flattering, especially in the back. it does have slits on the sides so you really would need to wear a layer underneath. i've worn it with a turtleneck and button-ups and it looks rea",5
"I tried this on in store but didn't purchase it due to price, then kicked myself afterwards when my size was sold out online. i really wanted the gray. i finally was able to order my size when it was restocked very briefly and am so happy i did. this is such a cute poncho.

i also have the angel of the north poncho from last winter, and don't like that one nearly as much. that one was too long; this one is the perfect length. it curves down in the front and back, and then comes up at the sides r",5
"I love this jacket! works so well with business casual outfits, and the color goes with almost everything! great over blouses or t shirts. by far my favorite purchase in quite a while!",5
"I love this! i bought it in the red color. in person it is a deeper color than it looks online and it has some flecks of lighter yarn in it that just add to it's beauty. it is very soft and cozy. it is warm without being hot. i typically wear a small/sometimes medium at retailer. i bought a medium only because i wanted it to be a little longer so that i could wear it with leggings and feel comfortable. i am 5'8"" though, so if you are shorter than you may not need to size up. it looks great with a",5
"Received the jacket today -- i love it but because it has no stretch in the material it feels a little snug across the shoulders. i have long arms and it fit perfect for the length. i tried to order the next size to see how it would fit, but it was sold out! i'll keep looking for it to be back in stock.",5
This is my second pair of pilcro jeans and the second time i am totally impressed. these jeans have a comfortable stretch and rugged wash that is trendy & fun. they are the perfect everyday jean and look great casually with a pair of birkenstocks or converse low tops. the only thing worth pointing out is that i am pretty short (5'4) and the regular length fits me perfectly. this may be an issue for ladies lucky enough to have some extra inches on me.,5
I really like this dress a lot. the material is soft and comfortable. it is clingy but not in a bad way. the design can camouflage some figure problems. i thought it looked better with a belt so i added a skinny beige/pink belt which worked great. can't say enough about how comfortable this dress is.,5
"This poncho is perfect! the slits on the side may seem intimidating at first, but wear a flowy tank under neath it for a nice added detail. it's easy to wear over a fitted dress as well, or a high-waisted full skirt.
i have red hair and the gold looks amazing with that hair color. but the grey and creme are neutral and go well with a lot of options.",5
"I saw this online, and decided to go to the store to have a look at it in person. i was not disappointed at all! it is so gorgeous! i purchased the burgundy color, and have received so many compliments. it is very well made. i am 5'5"", 126 lbs, and purchased a small. i think some others mentioned it falls short in back, but on me it falls well passed my bottom. maybe they purchased a petite.",5
"Like another reviewer, i initially passed by this sweater and thought nothing of it until i noticed it on display... super cute and ultra comfy... the kind of sweater that just beckons to be warn in the fall. i purchased this in the olive color and just love it. very cute and flattering for a poncho-type sweater. i do think it runs a bit large so i sized down for the perfect fit. i highly recommend this item!",5
"Other than the color (i got the rose color), which is great, i think my favorite part about this jacket is that the sleeves are actually long enough. i am 5'7"" and the sleeves come right to my wrists, if not just a tad longer onto my hands. it's also got some stretch to it so it doesn't make you feel to stiff as you wear it; you can move in it :) it's very comfortable and pretty.",5
"I bought the wine color. typically wear med or large., med was plenty big.... the color is deep and beautiful. is so soft and flowing. i love it!",5
"This blouse is gorgeous, i purchased in two colors and absolutely love it. just a side note i normally wear a size small blouse or size 4-6 blouse, in this i went up a size and purchased the medium.",5
"This skirt was very figure flattering, and the elastic waist is comfortable and does not cut into my sides! has a great look",5
"I bough this in the blue green color and it's absolutely beautiful -- just as it appears online. actually the shirt in general looks just like it does online -- it's fitted up top and flowy everywhere else. this may be because i'm fairly straight-figured -- it's possible it would be less flattering on a bigger bust. i agree with the other reviewers who say the fabric wrinkles too easily. i am sometimes an xs and sometimes a s, and i ordered the s in this and like how it fits. note: in meadow rue",5
"This blouse makes me feel young, vibrant, and beautiful! i got it in (2) colors with the coupon special. i love how it fits and it's slimming! love it. i have broad shoulders, and it is very slimming.",5
"Pretty obsessed with this top. it feels like a cotton, poncho. it's definitely made to be over-sized and flowy. it even hangs off the shoulder some. it does run very large. i'm normally a medium to a large and i purchased the xs (never ever an xs normally). even still it's loose as it's designed to be. so definitely size down 2 sizes. other than that super comfy and a casual top that can be worn to make my leggings and flip flops a little more ""fancy"". would also be nice with jeans for a casual",5
Absolutely love these. i ordered them in bronze and i'm thinking about getting the lilac pair as well. they're super comfortable and look great on.,5
"When i put this skirt on my aunt said that looks like a skirt with class. she's right. this skirt feels as wonderful on as it looks. i love the faux leather slash, it is the perfect detail without detracting from a printed top. i think it is great to just slip on no zipper (for those days).i even pulled this on over a dress. bailey 44 hits it out of the park again. i have 3 dresses and now a skirt. t.e colors on the website are brighter than they are in person, just fyi.",5
"Bought this online to get something in the purple family. it's a deeper hue than pictured and, as others have noted, there are variations in the color all over. cute with jeans, definitely an upgrade from a boring old t. one word to the wise--saw the ""pink"" in the store today. definitely not pink--it's orange. i'm 5'6"", 127 lbs., and 34b. bought xs and it is perfect.",5
"Cute and simple top. a little tight through the bust. looks great tucked or out, and super cute with a simple jacket. easy piece to dress up or down.",5
"I love this outfit so much and bought the skirt pictured with the top on the model in high hopes my quest for the perfect date night outfit would be ended. not so. for starters the top is much more of a beige in person. a horrible unflattering color that few can get away with successfully. secondly there is just so. much. fabric. it billows and bunches all over the place to wear it out like that as shown would be silly and to tuck it in looks like i've tried to hard to make it ""work"", lastly the",1
"I've got a bit of a love/hate relationship with this top. the fabric feels a little odd and wrinkles crazy hard, and i'm not a fan of the open ladder ribbon over the bust (really? who needs to see the top of my bra?). but i love love love the overall fit, the details (like the polka dot trim and the sheer tucks) and the color (blue green). it looks good tucked in or loose, and i can layer it under cardigans and jackets. i'll get a matching ribbon and sew it in under the ladder ribbon so it's act",5
"This tee has the cutest details and the green is actually a beautiful, deeper green. the shirt has a great fit and looks so much more flattering on than the pictures show. (5'4"" 109# got an xs, slightly loose, exactly how i like it.) the somewhat mottled/dye type color makes it a casual piece for me; great with jeans. nice fabric, thickness.",5
"Love this chemise. perfect blend of comfort and sexy. i bought it in pink, size small. i'm a 32d about 115 lbs and if fit perfectly, i could even probably go to an xs, but i didn't want to wait. the fabric is super soft and the color is vibrant. looks exactly like the picture. decent price.",5
"Really like these -- they fit really well and look great with a pair of chucks and a sweater if i'm dressing down a bit, as well as with flats and a nicer blouse. really versatile. i'm kind of pear-shaped, and these seem to minimize my flaws a bit, too, so that never hurts!",5
"I had never worn pilcro jeans, and i took a chance and ordered without trying them on. i couldn't be more pleased! i wear a 26, but it is often difficult to find a good fitting pair of jeans. these fit comfortably and don't feel too tight, but are fitted enough to look great. i like the little bit of extra room around the top, allowing the jeans to feel comfortable. i'll be back for more pilcro jeans!",5
"The lilac pic of this shirt doesn't do it justice......it is so darn cute on! the band around the waist really draws your eye in and makes your waist look really small.... love that!!! also, the pleated sleeves are just so feminine and pretty! the fabric is like a washed cotton.....very soft. i can see this being dressed up or made really casual.....i bought the green color and am going to wear it with a chunky turquoise necklace and pencil skirt!",5
Love these! so comfy and a great color! also love that it came in petite! it is so hard to find avoid crop pant in petite!!!,5
"Love this chemise. the lace detail is cute, the length of the skirt is longer than many of the night gowns you'd find in the cute, not frumpy category, and overall it is super soft and comfortable for lounging and sleeping. bought the large, and i'm normally around a size 8-10, between medium and large depending on the cut of the item. the large is slightly on the big size, so the straps move around when i sleep. not a big deal for me, so i kept it.",5
"I recently purchased this blouse in black. i love the soft yet crepe like fabric and the small bit of negative space trim just above the bust line gives it an air of elegance. comfortable and breathable, i see this becoming a ""how did i live without this"" staple.",5
Lately retailer tees have been misses for me but i was intrigued by the reviewers comments about the shaping of the tee to enhance the illusion of a waistline. that drew me in because i have a short waist and some shaped tees just cling there and emphasize rolls more than my waist. but not this one. it is more fitted along the back waist and looser in the front. i generally order size large in tees as i did with this one. i don't think the fit is too big because it's cut not to cling anywhere. i h,5
"I sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent-like. the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute, feminine details.",1
This top reminds me of something out of the 40's. it is super comfortable and just makes a very clean look,5
I absolutely love this top! ordered the moss color in size xxs. i am 5'5 105 lbs. i typically wear xs and 0 in retailer clothing. this top is kinda flared/loose fitting so i would size down. the website currently says it's by everleigh but the tag says eri & ali. color is a little darker in person but tie dye effect is spot on. it's beautiful! and super super comfy! i am currently wearing it with my lululemons! but can defin see this top being dressed up with a cute pendant necklace and skinny bla,5
"Lovely dress. the beautiful colors are exactly as shown on the website. i'm 5'2"" and it reaches about midway down my shin. i'm normally a size 0 and i ordered the x-small and it fits perfectly. definitely a keeper!",5
"Pilcros always fit perfectly and these jeans are no different. the style is great and a little different with the slits on the side. i bought the gold color which is a little brighter than pictured. for that reason, i'm on the fence about keeping them. i wish there were other bold colors to choose from since most of the other choices seem washed out.",5
"In love with this blouse, i first got in ivory went back and got in black, you can dress casual or up.",5
"Got these in my usual size and they are wonderful! the gray goes with everything, i'm hoping they come out with some greens or blues too!",5
"I love these jeans! i came on here to see if they were here on sale, and they are but alas, not in my size. i probably wear these three times per week - to work, going out with friends, all over. i got the gray and i would say the color on the site is true to how they look in person. i bought mine in the store and i will say that i've been on the fence about whether they're gray or purple but the site says gray. if you want a true gray that is a more blue-ish gray, then these are not it because",5
"I got these in gray. like other reviewers mentioned, the waist is a little higher (not 70s though) but the jean had great control so it ""holds"" everything in instead of creating a muffin top which many shorter waisted jeans do. contours to the leg. love it!",5
"Another wonderful deletta top is hanging in my closet! i love the cotton. i love the style. medium fit perfect. it is loose around the middle, so soft and comfortable. i purchased the lavender washout. i know i will be wearing this frequently.",5
They are really cute. the fabric is a little stiff but the details are nice. the waist seems big so i suggest sizing down. i bought 27 p my usual size and sent them back for a 26 p because the waist was big.,5
"I love pilcro and this pair is another proof why i love it! i bought a pair in light red - the color is so pretty. the fit is perfect. i normally wear petites, but this time bought a regular length, and i love it. it is not too long, as the pants are cropped, and not too short as the petite cut might have been.
pilcro never disappoints me, as i have many different pairs and love each one of them. may go for another color in this same style. they are awesome!!",5
This is tee is so soft and the other one in the same brand is the same. love the details also and the color wash.,5
"Great fit, looks excellent with jeans as well as tucked in with a pencil skirt.",5
"These are my favorite pair of capris/ankle jeans ever! i'm 5'4"", 120lbs and got the 28 petite in gray. the fit is fantastic and the length is perfect for summer days (couple inches above my ankles). the gray color is so versatile and i can dress it up or down. i plan on getting it in other colors as well since the fit is so good.",5
"Super flattering cut and the material is like buttah! no seriously, it's like a 10-yr old tee soft! the colors aren't even close compared to online, though. the green is a brighter almost grass green and the pink is more like a salmon color. i didn't see the lilac in the store.",5
I purchased the teal/blue and the color is striking. though i put true to size the decorative top is slightly tight around the bust. and the bottom too is fitted and not flowy. for a looser fit you may want to size up. for a more fitted look it is true to size.,5
"I snagged this top with the 25% off sale and it's adorable. i got the white, and it goes great with some skinny jeans or tucked into a skirt. i found it ran true to size. my only complaint is that like some other reviewers have stated, it does wrinkly very easily. and i would say for full price i don't think the quality is worth the cost, but on sale, it's a great shirt.",5
These are a great versatile pair of black pants. they look chic without trying too hard and they work well dressed up or down. they do run a bit big as others have said. i generally wear a 16 and thats what i got in these but they're definitely big and bag out by the end of the day.,5
The top is adorable and i love it. however the pink is not pink but more of a very faded orange color. i was really hoping for pink but the shirt is a keeper.,5
"This top also caught my eye in my local store, and being a devoted deletta lover, i had to buy. it is a straight, slim fit, so i bought a medium, instead of my usual small, to glide over my curvy lower half. it's thin, finely woven knit, with two cute little buttons at the top of the side slit; the cut and longer length in the back is very flattering. i bought the heathered black and have worn with my black pilcro leggings; it's a great top to wear over leggings or skinny jeans; no belts with th",5
I love this top! the fit is perfect and i particularly like the longer back. there is a split between the shorter front and longer back which is brilliant so you can move and sit without it pulling around your bum. looks great with skinny jeans or with leggings. it is very light weight and is perfect for spring. the sleeves are slightly fitted and very comfortable. the quality and construction is great. i am 5 feet and got a petite xs which is perfect.,5
"I wore this dress to my work christmas party and got compliments all night! it's a beautiful dress with fantastic details, and it is very comfortable. i am 5' 5.5"" and about 122 lbs. i am typically a 0 on top, 2 waist, and 2-4 bottom. i ordered the 2 and it was the right choice for me. it was a little snug on the bum and around the thighs (it pulled ever so slightly in the front) but it still looked good. it's stretchy without looking like it is stretchy. the top part of the dress fit well, and",5
"The photo of this dress does not do it justice. this dress is absolutely gorgeous. the construction is very high quality. i always worry about peekaboos with button front dresses as i am very busty. total non-issue with this dress. the petite fit is also spot on. it is slightly large in the back bodice for me, but i always have that problem. it's an easy tailoring fix.

i think i'm in love with byron lars <3",5
"I tried this dress on and thought it was stunning. the cut was just right, it fit all my slight curves. i'm 5'8 and 145lbs- a slender build and bought the size 8. it is lined and the material is high quality with an illusion of sheer. the length hits me just on my knees and the look is so audrey hepburn. the belt is made of a grosgrain black material and adds another elegant touch if used; it looks great without it too. of course this dress comes at a high price point, but with the 25% of full p",5
"Fits great, comfortable!",5
"This dress is beautiful and unique but if you are more pear shaped get the correct size to fit your hips. it fits very close through the behind --but is stretchy. as i was putting it on and felt it hugging me closely, i thought it would never work - but when i looked in the mirror i found it looked quite nice even though it clings. and the stretch allows plenty of movement. if i size up to allow more room in the hips then i think it will be too loose on top. so i will just wear it with spanx. th",5
This top has beautiful subtle metallic bits in the pattern. fell in love with the fabric. looks great with high-waist pants.,5
Great transitional top.  comfy and great fit.  i like my tops to be somewhat roomy and this was great in a small.  i usually buy medium.,5
"This dress fitted me like a glove. i ordered the size 4, at 5ft7 and 130lbs, it was perfect though i could not weigh two pounds more. i cannot wait to wear it, it has that wow thing going for it, very good quality too.",5
"This dress is adorable. the ruffles are a very cute detail. the top is a bit transparent. for the price it probably should have included something to make it less transparent, but it is so cute i will just put a cami underneath. runs true to size, my usual xsmall fit perfect (5'4"", 34c, 135 lbs). i didn't find the top to be that blousy, i thought it was perfect for me.",5
I love the dress as shown in the photo. thankfully i had a chance to see the dress in the store. it is sheer. can see thru it. can not wear this to work.,1
"Sexy, yet sweet and demure? all points checked with cute little number. this is the third byron dress i've bought and like the melodist, i purchased the 8p and had the same issue--too loose in the hips",5
"This is my third byron lars and as usual it is absolutely gorgeous and so worth the price. it completely flatters the body and all the details add so much interest, creating a very unique dress.",5
"Several months ago i bought the byron lars pieced brocade dress (size 10) it's a little large through the torso area but with the belt it fits good enough. since i have loved this dress so much i wanted another byron lars dress so i bought the carissima sheath and the sunrose dress both in a 10. they both were way too big so i ordered a size 8 and they both just barely fit ??? oh was i disappointed....so one more try, i ordered this dress the allusione sheath size 10, and yepeee it fits perfect",5
"I bought this in the dark gray and it's got a lot of blue undertones to it. it's beautiful and flattering in my regular size, not too fitted -- not as loose as on the model but still roomy enough. i'll take the advice of a previous reviewer and wash only the armpits when needed. this fabric is so delicate i'm afraid it will shrink if i ever submerge the whole thing in water. it's a gorgeous piece and i'm happy to have it for the remaining cool days of the season.",5
"This sweater is beautiful and looks exactly as pictured in terms of fit, length, and color. the fabric is super soft and not at all itchy - feels soft like a boucle type knit. the sleeves are 3/4 length and the weight is maybe a medium-weight (not super warm). i wouldn't see this taking me too far into a northeastern winter, but for right now it's perfect!! fit is tts :)",5
"I love this dress; however, b/c of my broad shoulders i need to size up. i would say if you have a straight and slender frame then it's tts. the bottam half was fine it was a tad bit snug around the arm pits for me. it is very cute for spring summer. it is sold out.",5
"I loved this top when i first saw it online and it did not disappoint when i received it in the mail. it's very lightweight, perfect for spring, cool summer night, early fall. i really like the design and like that you can tuck it in. there is enough fabric in the front to give it a ""flowy"" look that i appreciate bc i will be giving birth soon and my post baby body will likely need some coverage! great top!",5

I love this poncho/sweater. it feels cozy and looks really cool. can't wait til the weather cools down so i can wear it.,5
"I saw army green pants similar to this in the store, but then found these on line and ordered them instead. i love them. they stretch out a bit so i am glad i sized down. i could possibly have sized down even one more size. i got a 27. the waist is very comfortable, so maybe this is just the fit...after all, they are basically stylish fatiques. either way, they are casual but on trend. i have planned a ton of outfits in my head already because these pants will go with so much! i think the cuff w",5

These menswear inspired trouser and beyond cute and comfy. great color and fit. soft interior. dress up with a blazer or go casua with a tee. adorable.,5
"Great little shift dress! for me it seemed to run true to size. i'm 5' 4.5"" and curvy. the regular size 10 fit perfect, about 3"" above the knee. a really fun design with the fringe. can't wait to wear once the snow is completely gone.",5
This is soo cute and definitely runs tts. i ordered both the 6 and the 8 and ended up keeping the 8. i absolutley love this and i think it is unique and fun! i plan to wear it on a vacation in a month.,5
"I love clothes, and my mom raised me to look for styles that are different, and unique. these pants are it! they fit beautifully, but run slightly big. i'm between a 4 and a 6, actually kept both. the 4 fits great in the hips and legs, plenty of room if you have curves (i do not), but it's a tad tight in the waist, if that helps. these are a perfect length, at 5' 7"" they hit above my ankle bone, and look perfect w a pointed, closed shoe. i love the colors, and am bored to death of black and grey",5
"I'm 5 feet tall, so dresses are hard to find for me. but, the petite sizes fit accurately. i'm very pleased with the dress!!!",5
"Really really like this dress. expected it to be shorter based on other reviews, but at 5'6 it it was a great length for me. it is true to size and while it was a little bit of a loose fit, it was just enough to hide trouble areas. sometimes i struggle with dresses such as this because they are too big on top and snug in the hip area, but this one was perfect for me. great find!",5
I love these pants. i saw them and had to have them. i love the classic plaid style and have always loved the blue/green combination. i purchased the fisherman sweater and saw these pants and new it would be a hit. get compliments on this combo all the time.,5
"First, thanks retailer for not putting itchy wool or fur in this! it's so soft! gorgeous bias for is super flattering for those of us with less than perfect bodies. for reference, i'm 5'5"", 32dd, 28, 38. size xs/s was perfect.",5
I've worn this twice now and got a ton of compliments on it. it's so comfortable and looks great. the lavender color is gorgeous. highly recommend.,5
"These are fantastic jeans. true to size but know that if you are average height, you'll need to wear heels with these. imo flare pants look much better with heels anyway.",5
"I am a little retailer obsessed and have a lot of clothing from here....this has to be the best thing i've ever purchased. it is so soft and beautiful. i am 5'11 and 150lbs and got the m/l ...fits perfectly and doesn't swallow me up but it does hide my bottom and the sides come up but not to wear my side stomach is showing. it does sit at an angle on the body but to me that's so perfect, a little different and not a defect. it is not itchy whats so ever. i love this with skinny jeans and brown boo",5
"Just to back up what everyone else is saying, this poncho is perfect. it is indeed super soft! casual and fun. i personally thought the coloring at the bottom was even prettier than pictured. this poncho is not tight around the neck, yet not lose. it goes right over your head without messing up your hair. i love the sleeves. they can be worn above the elbow or easily pulled just down below it. a great alternative to a sweater. i ordered the petite xs/s and i'm 5'3. hits right at bum.",5
Cute casual drawstring short. runs a little large but nice style for an oversized look. nice length for long legs.,5
"This dress is even better in person! i am usually a size 2 and i went up to a 4. it is my favorite dress this spring! it is so cute with booties or sandals. i would say that it runs slightly small, so you should get the next size up if you're busty or have hips. it has been selling fast, you should get it while you can! :)",5
I loved how soft the top was on my skin... plus the sexy detail in the back was a win !,5
"I love this dress! i spotted it in the store yesterday right before walking out. i almost missed it! i'm so glad that i didn't because this dress is super cute. the fit is nice too. not too short. the fringe detailing is very cool. i cannot wait to wear this dress this spring/summer. casual enough for flip flops, but could also be dressed up with some cute wedge sandals.",5
"More of an a-line rather than tunic shape--which makes this a great, flattering, spring-through-summer party and barbecue throw on. true to size, washable. the indigo and purpley-gray pop with the mix of rose stripes, and the fringe and length keep it from being dowdy. i'm 5'5"" and this hit mid thigh. i keep pulling it out of the closet and trying it on! can't wait for the weather to turn in earnest to wear this sassiness out.",5
Excellent dress for lounging in the house or for sleeping. very comfortable and a little sexy at the same time.,5
"This is a great quality top. it did not look great on me, since i am quite top heavy. but is lovely.",5
"Absolutely love! as others have mentioned, it's super comfy and the colors in the bottom definitely brighten up the sweater. the online brand says monogram, but the tag says sleeping on snow....weird.",5
I get the great reviews. these do for me what no jogger could. i have hips. i never thought these would work. they do and they look just as cool on me as the model. i am a 10-12. i could only find a 12 but i think a 10 would be perfect. they are effortlessly cool and casual...for all body types. i'm so excited i tried these on.,5
"This is my fourth amadi piece from retailer.  i love their signature fitted crossover top design which i am finding in many of their pieces (like the lola jumpsuit, crossfront lola dress and others).  this dress has the same crossover top design, with a slim maxi silhouette.    the fabric is 97% rayon and 3% nylon with a neat texture that doesn't come through on the product photo but adds to its appeal in my opinion because it hides wrinkles.  it fits tts and the same as the other amadi pie",5

what more could you ask for?",5
"My only wish is that the front waistband were more high-waisted, but other than that, the pants are darling--flattering, vintage yet on-trend and made with high quality fabric and tailoring. i am 5'2"" 125 pounds and i bought a size 4. they are a perfect fit.",5
"I received so many compliments on these pants! these are not only classic, they fit amazing...look great with heels and/or booties. match both black and brown.",5
"So, i usually find that retailer tops run large (everywhere else i'm a medium, but i'm always a small at retailer) but with pants or slacks i'm usually an 8 and i always have to size up in retailer to a 10, but based on some of the other ""runs large"" reviews, i stuck with my normal size 8 and they fit perfectly! super cute. not lined, but the material has a nice weight to it, so that doesn't bother me. will def be wearing to the office.",5
This is a beautiful skirt that is extremely well made.,5
"Great design & execution - this is essentially a striped jersey sleeveless turtleneck, made of a nice, high-quality jersey. with a delicate lightweight soft sweater attached over it. so you get this really pretty look where the jersey underlay means the sweater hangs beautifully, no clinging at all. and the sleeves are just the sheer sweater - so pretty.

i got the lavender - looks exactly like the pic. and it is true to size.",5
"Love this sweater! beautiful detail, thicker yarn and well made. sweater has more structure to it than i had anticipated, which makes it look more tailered while being soft and comfortable. hits my lower hip and i'm 5'6"". receive compliments every time i wear it.",5
"When this poncho first came online i ordered it in the xs/s, my usual size. i was a little disappointed that the point in the front oddly hung low & was off-center. the back was centered. i returned it. when i spotted them at the store recently, i tried on a few in the xs/s to compare & see how others hung. i found that one of them hung fine in the front (centered), the back was a little off center which was fine. it's soft & comfy, love the soft white color & border trim. it's just perfect!",5
"I love these pants. i vary between 10 & 12, the 10 fit perfectly since they are designed on the fuller size, perfect for my body type of small waist and a bit of bottom. so many colors to coordinate with these pants. teal green, ""retailer"" yellow, black...i am not fond of ankle pants, prefer longer pants. i took the cuffs down and lengthened the pants. the only problem is that these pants are so exquisitely made, removing the cuff tacks was a challenge! perfect pants for those of us who have shape",5
Great pants. i'm 5'6 and about 130. the size 2 fit nice at the waist and loose in the thigh. they hit right at the ankle. the colors are nice/ muted. the details are great. overall great pants.,5
"So soft, high quality, perfect poncho sweater that will go with every pair of jeans you have. love!",5
"Love this dress. the description says ""pull over styling"" but it's not. there is a side zipper which i think makes for a better fit. i bought a 4 which fit great. i'm 5'4"" 125 lbs and it hits right above the knee.",5
"I was hesitant to buy this, but i'm so glad i did. this is a beautiful poncho. i am petite and usually ponchos overwhelm me, but this fits just right. it is extremely soft, not itchy at all. the color along the bottom of the poncho is actually a bright pink color, it looks a little more red in the photo to me. i'm still happy with this. it will be a wonderful addition to my fall/winter wardrobe. great product!",5
"Best bathing suit bottoms ever. low-rise doesn't work forever, and this bottom is perfect if you want a little more coverage without being too mom-ish. the ruching gives it a really cute retro feel (as opposed to a granny panties feel). my usual size small fits great, and i definitely did not have the problem another reviewer did with it coming up past the belly button (it hits me right where it hits the model in the photo). i just wish they made it in more prints! there are some really cute top",5
Such a fun jacket! great to wear in the spring or to the office as an alternative to a formal blazer. very comfortable!,5
"Love cloth and stone. this dress looks and fits exactly as pictured. soft and casual, with great design details.",5
"High quality fabric and lots of bottom/ back coverage. also, it did not cut into my hips (which is fabulous!) ...so, if you're looking for a little more coverage this is your bottom. i found it true to size...i'm 5'8"" and 150 lbs and i got a size 8 :)",5
"I bought this in both colors,for it is perfect for me.it looks great with jeans and then dress it up later with pants.this is why i love retailer!",5
This jacket is perfect. swings just the right amount without looking too big.,5
I ordered these in a medium and they fit but i wanted more coverage so i sized up. i wear a 26 or 27 and i took the large. the large isn't tight at all but the medium was. i like my bottoms to have a lot of coverage and don't mind them a little big. i like how much coverage they provide but still look feminine and cute.,5
"Oh how i have searched for a mid-rise bottom that was not matronly, and finally i have found one! they cover just enough of the back without looking like my mothers bathing suit butt, and the ruched sides add just enough interest to not be boring in a solid color. and speaking of the color, the blue is beautiful. i am happy with these and hope they hold up for several years. i am 125 lbs and the small fit perfect.",5
I saw this jacket in the store and it looks and fit beautiful! it fits tts and is forgiving to the curvy. this is a staple piece to have during the fall or spring. highly recommend.,5
I just bought this jacket for my mom to take with her on a trip to europe. it is perfect! perfect packing piece that doesnt wrinkle and is a substantial enough weight to wear on chilly evenings. considering buying an additional one in my size...,5
I can't wait for the milder weather to arrive so i can wear this tunic. it is very stylish and elegant and one of those rare pieces that makes you feel good wearing it.,5
"Beautiful fabric, great quality, fits true to size. love them!",5
"This is a quirky, whimsical, uniquely designed top that's sure to get a lot of comments and opinions (and hopefully good ones!). i really love it. think it is what it is, a fun, conversation piece.  and isn't that what's great about fashion? tts, very comfy, yes boxy, but i don't think in a bad way. the ruffle on the bottom is adorable. would look great with slim ivory or white denim and booties, or even a darker denim. hits mid bum. nice quality too.",5
"Like the other reviewer said, there's a nice inner lining, and the material of the jacket is just so nice. looks a little like a blazer when worn, but the heather gray makes it a dress up or down sort of piece.",5
I absolutely love this dress! it's great for business casual. it's also such a great color for the transition into fall.,5
"I am 5' 7"" - 110 lbs. ordered my normal xs and the bottom portion was way over sized. it fit like a parachute, you could fit about 12 of me in the bottoms and very short. nice quality material, but extremely awkward fit.",1
These bottoms are super comfortable. i think they run a little big for a small. i bought another swimsuit from retailer and the bottoms are also small and fit a little better than these. it goes well with the peplum swimsuit top. im so excited about wearing them this season!!,5
Love this vintage high waisted bikini bottom! fits true to size. it pulls up to a little past my belly button and the runching is in all the right places. i'm not too sure how it will stay put in the waist area for a dip in the ocean . can't wait to lounge around in it ar the beach though.,5
I absolutely love this piece. it's a beautiful and chic piece that is perfect for any occasion,5
"I love this, just bought it and so glad i did. really want to wear it out, so hopefully the weather will cool down soon since i am in the south and we are experiencing an extremely warm winter. regardless, it will be with me a long time...so if i don't use it this season, i will eventually as it is timeless and goes with anything.",5
"Ok, so who likes to buy bathing suits? apparently i do, because this one arrived today in the white and rust, and i'm buying the black one in a second! i can't pass up such a flattering suit. the ruched bottom gives just enough extra so it's not skin tight to your bottom. and the top has just the right amount of cover. the whole suit is easy to wear, nicely made, and flattering through the roof.",5
"This shirt is adorable but it's really just a cotton t-shirt. based on the picture online, i thought it would have more weight, be a more substantial fabric. again, it's adorable but not sure how long it will last.",5
I bought this dress on a whim.  i am so glad i did!  got it in black.  it is stunning and comfortable,5
"Cute tee. it's a casual tee with some nice detailing that gives it some style. the fabric is a good thickness. not see-through thin but light enough for warm weather. the color should match pretty much anything. nice neckline. i think it runs slightly large. i hover between a small, extra small with tops and the xs fit nicely. i do have narrow shoulders, 32dd, so women with normal to wide shoulders might prefer their usual size. i don't expect people to gush over it with compliments but it it a",5
"Dress is nice but can't be worn without tights or you are at a risk of indecently exposing yourself. it is around 30"" in length so is more of a tunic than a dress. i'm only 5'1 and it was too short . can't imagine anyone taller even trying to wear this !",1
"It's hard to find a comfortable, attractive tee. this one is it for me. ordered a large. it skims perfectly over my back and lower half. no grabbing. sleeves are cut nicely for those of us who don't love their upper arms. the lacing adds nice detail and interest. it's soft and comfy. it's an unusual color that will go with almost any bottom. great now and under a jean jacket or cardigan as the weather cools.",5
"Cute top, great for the inner maid marian fan. :) fun twist on t-shirt in regular size. also ordered the alexandria top in somewhat similar vein, but didn't care for that one at all. this one was cute and the fit is flattering. the other is boxy and boring to me. recommend this one.",5
"Love this top--the material is very soft and though this isn't a thick tshirt, it holds its shape and supports the grommet detailing nicely. i'm 5'7"", about 130, not busty, and got a small--fits great! the color is more of an off-rose/blush (has more of a brown tint than the photo shows).",5
"I actually saw this dress on an associate and didn't like it. but as i was trying on other things, i saw my size hanging on a rack in the dressing room and thought - why not, just try it. glad i did! it is so flattering on and you can dress it up or down it's so versatile. i received so many compliments when i wore this, glad i gave it a try!",5
"I absolutely adore this dress! i was nervous to try it because i just had a baby, thinking that the waist tie looked potentially bulky/stiff based on the images. i am so glad i gave this a shot - it is actually one of the few dresses that i am comfortable wearing right now. the tie helps make me look like i have a waist, even though i don't right now, while covering up some of the leftover baby weight. i grabbed this is my usual size s (27 / 34b / 5'7""), and found it to fit perfectly, plus the t",5
The print caught my eye. then i felt the breathable cotton fabric and had to try it on. i am only 5'2'' and have a small waist but sized 32dd bust with hips and have a hard time finding clothes that fit well.. this dress fit me perfectly! i have dressed it up and down and always get compliments. this dress was on the pricey side but has turned out to be worth every penny.,5
"Wow, i didn't think this dress would work on my curvy frame. i still have a baby belly and some dresses look like mumu's on me. this was so flattering, the waist cinches nicely and the length is just above the knee. i am 5.6"" and 145lbs for reference. the weight its light/cottony and it looks great with flats and wedges. 
love it!",5
"My stylist brought me the regular xs to try on in the store and almost told me i should buy it... the length seemed just fine, but i usually get petite so decided to order the xs petite before deciding... good decision, there is less fabric in the skirt, so it seemed anyway, so i am less overwhelmed buy the skirt. the cut is super flattering, and length was actually better (the longer sides hit ,me around the knee). i wasn't sold on the dolor, as i have pale skin, but there is enough dark to com",5
"This dress is the absolute best. it is comfy, flattering, cute - pretty much the best dress ever. as a previous reviewer said, ti is a 3 - even 4 - season dress. throw it on with boots and a wool cardi in the winter and youre all set. i didnt even think twice about buying it. perfect length- a little longer in the back but not too short in the front (and i do not like short dresses/skirts). dont think about it... just buy.",5
"So gorgeous! the details make this tank so special! the subtle sequin around the neckline are just enough to make this a dress-up or dress-down top. perfect with skinny jeans for an evening date night or a black cardigan for the office. the fabric is soft -- almost like a very light weight knit sweater, but so light that you can wear it for summer.",5
"I haven't gotten a dress from retailer in a long time that i like as i do this one! this is the old retailer-quality, extras, and unique design! fits like it was made for me-tts, i am 5'5"", 142 lbs and the 6 is perfection! no enlarged arm holes or funky fit...it has lining as well as a tu-tu slip underneath so you can create your own fullness in the skirt. it is very fitted at the bust and waist and will hide numerous flaws at the hips. this dress is spectacular so don't wait...press the button!!!!",5
"This dress is really beautiful and high quality. the pattern, color, and fabric are great. the fit is flattering (i'm hourglass to pear shaped) and the size perfect for me in petite. please keep offering high quality clothes in petite sizes by higher end designers.",5
"Was hopeful this might work on my petite pear shape (i am 5', probably 135-140lb; one to two sizes larger on the bottom) when i first saw online so went to store to give the regular size a trial run before ordering the petite size online. you can never tell with these flare dresses - some just make the hips look so much worse and haven't had a lot of luck with casual retailer flare dresses this season. first tried on the medium and fell in love instantly - was looking a little big but thought orde",5
"I walked right by this dress until an associate of mine asked me to try it on. i am so glad she did. this dress is far more flattering on me then i expected and it has pockets! after assessing it further, i decided i liked the material it is lined and will not make you look like a wrinkled up paper bag after sitting down. i bought a small, i compared the medium and both would work on my frame because of the tie waist. i am 5ft 3"" 137 lbs 36b chest and i have a proportionate athletic figure. for",5
"My new favorite! i wouldn't have thought twice about this dress handling on a rack in store, but after seeing so many cute pics of ladies in this dress, i caved. i needed a petite, so ordered a sp and xsp. the length on both is perfect. i'm 5'0"" and both hit above my knee in front and hit at in back and on sides. i didn't try on a regular in store, but based on the sp/xsp, i'm pretty sure there'd be too much material for a petite frame. the xsp is cut slimmer and if i had a tiny waist, i'd proba",5
"I just bought this dress in the store and i love it. i'm in my 50s and it does every thing i need a dress to do. it has sleeves, it's modest enough and shows my shape. the colors are great and go with most shoes. i'm heading to italy soon and this one will see me through many museums and churches. great buy!",5
"This dress is an absolute win. i was won over on the hanger by the linen fabric's lightweight nature, and then i tried it on. such a good fit for my high waist, and the tie was super flattering. i love this with booties as i was wearing today, but think it will be adorable with espadrilles as well for a more summery look. it's also the rare three season dress, with its cut and coloring working most of the year.  for sizing, i'd say it's true to size. i got my regular size s with no trouble with",5
This bra surprised me by how good it looks on. the placement of the lace and cups creates a flattering silhouette.,5
"I took the advise of a reviewer and sized down to xs. i am 5'6 and 110. i could take them off without unbuttoning them, they were hugh, even the xs! they looked like a halloween costume. even at the discounted sale price, awful and kind of made me laugh. but i guess that's why they are still available at this sale price.",1
"It's easy to miss the fine details that make this top special.the fabric inset around the collar & front placket is an abstract blossoming spring branch print overlaid with 3d decorative embroidery and clear sequins & is trimmed with a delicate lace. the sequins are eye-catching in a very subtle, shimmery way.

beautiful under a sweater, love the top's double layer look, fits tts, not too sheer. 

you might have to wear a strapless bra or do without one altogether because of the neckline and",5
"I too was immediately drawn to this dress online and was this close to ordering a petite when i stopped my my local retailer and they had just gotten it in, in regular only. of course i tried it on (in the xs regular) and was thrilled to find it fit perfectly and was so flattering on my hourglass figure. i'm 5'1"" and 115 with a 32 dd chest. no gaping or pulling, the waist and shoulders were where they should be and i found the length, with the hi/lo hem to be just above my knees in front. i think",5
"The wash is just as pictured, and the fit is great, i actually got a 29 when i usually wear a 28 but when i wear a belt with them they hug the waist perfectly. im always on the search from 28"" length however these jeans are a 30"" and still look excellent if i roll them up once.",5
"I agree with all the positive reviews about the look, fit and comfort of this dress.  definitely a four season dress.  for winter i plan on wearing wool tights, wool coat and boots and keeping the waist untied.  for me both the medium petite & regular looked good just a bit tight in the shoulders, since that's how my body is built.  i'm keeping the regular hem version.  my stats for fit reference: 5'3"" 140# 36dd, meaty arms/shoulders/back, small hips, no waist/bum.",5
"I love love love these bright red jeans. they fit great, they're super soft and comfortable, and the bright red is a great punch of color. only sad about how expensive they are. at that price point, i decided to return them, but am hoping they get marked down!",5
I was excited to try this dress on in person and so glad i did. it's actually really cute. the material is soft and super comfortable. the dress hits just above the knee and the tie in the front accentuates your waist. i was pleasantly surprised at how cute it really is. i'm excited to wear this to work! worth the price.,5
"I am 5'1"" and curvy, and purchased this dress in medium petite, and it fits to perfection! i love how light & breezy it is for those hot & muggy summer days. the tie front makes this style very flattering for all body types, and the skirt is lined so it is not see-through! plus, the pockets. this dress is a winner.",5
I love this dress! great fit and quality. love that the skirt is lined. this is a real throw on and go piece. i've worn it with wedges and with espadrille sneakers. my only complaint is that the sturdy material makes it difficult to get the tie waist to lay down flat. but overall an amazing dress!,5
"I love this dress! the colors work well with my olive skin color, it has pockets and it has a hi-lo front/back.â â i have slim hips so the tie waist is very flattering which gives an hourglass figure.â â i am 5?2?, 116 lbs and a 32d.â â i usually need a petite size because retailer dresses run a little long on me. but i was able to get away with getting an xs regular because of the hi-lo length. it fell perfectly above my knee.",5
"Top is very cute and wearable, fit is boxy but nice.",5
"This was a lovely skirt. the colors are beautiful, and the style is not too poofy like other ball skirts.
it is very high waisted, and at 5'8"" the length was similar to the model.",5
"Dark burgundy sweater, cable pattern in front (subtle; hard to see online) embedded with panels of brown tweed in peplum section. beautiful fall sweater.  soft and comfortable. looks great with skinny jeans, would also look nice with a casual skirt or pants.  beautiful color.  slightly roomy fit (not fitted, but not boxy)...true to general size. love this for fall and winter.  flattering, comfortable, unique.",5
"Three tops for the price of one.....i fell in love with this top the moment i saw it online. i tried it on as soon as i received it with jeans and it looked just how i hoped it would. not too short, just right. then i tried it on with the buttons in front and just loved how it looked. this can be worn 3 ways......back buttoned, front buttoned and as an unbuttoned throw on over a tank and shorts. recommend this highly for just about any body type..",5
This dress fits perfectly and true to size. the waist detail and flair is fun and flirty. it's probably my favorite dress i've ever bought.,5
"This is a unique blouse, it reminds me of the unique items i would find at the store many years ago. it is a gorgeous item. it does have a boxy fit, but it is not unflattering. i am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this product. 
the quality is nice and it is an item that people will notice.",5
"Every now and then a piece like this one comes along at retailer, and i quickly make the purchase without any regret.
without being stuffy or old, this top is simply elegant. the floral is very high-end designer (think italian made) for a fraction of the cost. made of 100% bamboo, it is light without being sheer. there is no need for a cami with this one. the fabric has the body of a good linen, but it doesn't wrinkle nearly as much. it does require dry cleaning, though, if this matters to you.",5
I was so afraid to get a too-small blazer (based on other reviews) that i ordered this two sizes up. i am usually a 0 or 2 in a blazer and ordered a 4. it was huge. i then ordered a 2 and it is just right. it's comfortable and chic and i love the blue and black combination.,5
"I honestly just love the hanky panky brand. i know it sometimes feels a little extravagant to purchase their lingerie, but the quality, fit and style are so good that it is absolutely worth it. this piece is no exception. i don't normally purchase lingerie like this, but saw this chemise and decided to try it. just as the other pieces from this brand, it's comfortable and gorgeous- so high quality and classy. it's a great cut, the fabric is clearly lace, but beautifully done. and the feel is lov",5
"This dress is even more amazing in person. the beading and embroidery are quite intricate and add a touch of elegance. the kimono like sleeves have the same details - especially nice for toasting!
be aware that the dress is not mid calf but just below the knee- a surprise but still quite lovely. the lines of the dress and exceptional detailing should make this dress a timeless classic. i look forward to wearing it to many occasions when a lbd would be just too expected!",5
Simple blazer with cute details - buttons on the back and lining. this will look good both in the office over over a pair of jeans and booties. i was able to go with the regular size (instead of petite) because i will wear with the sleeve rolled up.,5
"I was not in the market for a black blazer but saw this in store and had to try it on. the quality of the fabric and overall aesthetic is fantastic! love love love the gold buttons. this will look great for work, with jeans, or even as a cover up over a cute dress. i am a generally a size medium (sometimes small) and tend to fall between a 6 and 8, i went with the 8 in this jacket!",5
I purchased this blazer and its so comfortable. it runs small i am usually a size 6 but had to get it in size 8. i will be getting a lot of use out of this blazer. it can be worn professionally with skirt or solid color dress or casual with jeans. the fabric so very soft almost like a sweatshirt.,5
"This bra is everything. looks good and feels good. so happy with this purchase. for reference, i am a c cup and got a medium. i do have a little side boob action happening but i'm still happy with the fit of the medium",5
"The reviews are right about these fitting perfectly in the fitting room, i knew right off i had to get them. i have a flat rear end and these make my rear look great! i'm 5'5 about 130 lbs. and i chose the 29. i initially bought both the 28 and 29' to make sure they would not stretch out and the didn't. i didn't want to be squeezed in with the 28. i think they are very well made and i'll love wearing them for a long time.",5
"Ok. stop everything, take out your credit card & order this blazer immediately! i'm obsessed with blazers, but was on the fence about ordering this one (i mean, how many black blazers can one girl own?!), but after reading the outstanding reviews, i decided to go for it & i'm so glad i did! the online pictures do it no justice whatsoever, & i was afraid the polyester blend & gold buttons would look cheap, but, boy, was i in for a surprise when i opened my package! the black fabric looks high-end",5
"These jeans are the best. fit perfectly, so soft, comfortable, and look great on. i am in love. i put them on and did not want to take them off. i am 5'3"" and simply love the length for me. plus in my opinion the high waist is a s dream. so comfortable and really flatter my curves. these are pricey which is my only real complaint, but they are feeling worth it as i see myself wearing these a ton and the quality seems great, so i am thinking they will last a long time. don't hesitate to buy these",5
"I'm curvy, have very muscular thighs and am just under 5'5"". i was not very optimistic when the sales associate told me i would love these jeans. she was right, they're amazing. they are incredibly flattering, just the right length for me (even tho cropped) as i can wear them as full-length or just add one or two rolls and it's a crop. the fabric is amazingly soft and they immediately felt like a favorite, old pair of jeans. the pockets are well placed so they do wonders for the bootie. oh, and",5
"This is my second jacket from this brand cartonnier and i am thoroughly pleased. 

i love the quality and texture of the fabric of this coat. i think the styling is super classic with a little bohemian edge. 

i am 5' 3"" and 120 lbs and the size 4 fit me perfectly.",5
I purchased this jacket in my local store. size 10 and runs really small . i love the color combination and design but the fabric in my opinion is poor quality. i have seen a lot of retailer use this poly spun knit in so much of their items and the jacket after bringing it home and looking in the light was already showing pilling. looks like it is worn in an bad way. returned the next day. this was a big disappointment and every time i see this fabric being used in retailer clothes it makes me mad.,1
"I love this item! i'll wear it as a cover up or to dress up and go out. the material is great for summer- light and breathes. 
i first ordered a small because the medium was sold out. it fit too high-water. i then ordered the large and it fits great. the medium may have been fine too. i'm 5'4"", 145.",5
"True, this blazer runs small, so size up! beyond the beautiful depth of color from the herringbone black and dark blue, the stretchy fabric allows for flexibility in what you can wear underneath and for both your bloated and your skinny days. best of all this blazer could be worn 3-4 seasons out if the year and it's got a super-soft lining.",5
"These jeans are worth every penny! they fit me perfectly as soon as i put them on, and i wore them the rest of the day! they are true to size with very generous stretch...if anything, i would size down. they feel durable, but not like typical denim. very soft. i am 5'3"" and about 117 or so, and my normal 25 fit like a dream. i did end up exchanging these because there was a small nick on the inside of the left thigh, and i was afraid they might tear right open. if the new pair comes without defe",5
"This is a sweet little jacket. i saw it in the store but was unsure because of the price. but after trying it on, i just fell in love! the cut is really flattering. the jacket does run small. i really enjoy the little pop of color on the sleeves. my only complaint is the buttons make me nervous, because they seem to be heavy and i worry that i'll lose one, but only on the front 2, the arms and back buttons seem to be just fine. overall this is a fantastic buy that is great for an office setting",5
"This is the tiniest blazer i've ever purchased in a size 10. i usually wear an 8, but sized up based on other reviews and it was still too small. it's very attractive but please size true to size",1
"I was hesitant in purchasing these without trying them on first, but i'm happy i did. they are higher quality than the typical legging. the sizing runs bigger than average.",5
"I bought navy in my usual size s, and the color and fit are exactly as pictured. very good quality cotton. the pocket can lay funny on the hips but a little adjustments does the trick. i wore this chemise at home and hubby noticed it (never happens), i wore it to study in coffee shop with boots and scarf and felt comfortable, warm and stylish. great staple, well made and well priced.",5
Absolutely stunning dress. true to size and flows like a dream.,5
"These are a comfortable, flattering casual pant. i usually wear a 27 in skinny jeans, so i dropped down to a 26 to make sure they weren't to baggy. i love them and will wear the a lot!",5
"These are my new favorite pair of jeans. very flattering (particularly on the bum)! the wash is great - dark and slightly distressed, with a frayed hem at the ankle. the leg is straight rather than super skinny, which i am really enjoying as of late. fyi - i am usually a size 29 in denim, but went down to a 28 in this style.",5
This is such a comfy dress and recommend it to anyone. pairs amazing with leather boots and hat,5
"This dress is very well made and the fabric hangs beautifully. i weigh 125 and usually wear a small but sized up to medium for a longer sleeve and hem. the print, fabric and style make it appropriate for daytime or evening. it should transition nicely to fall and will look great with boots.",5
"I bought these on sale and love, love them! they are comfortable and super cute with the print detail on the calves and around the waist. i am waiting to receive the matching hoodie. don't know it i will wear them together since i don't like to be too ""matchy"". i have worn the leggings with a long black tunic top and grey slip on sneakers. very happy with this purchase!",5
"Love this top! the color is very pretty, great for the holidays. i haven't washed it yet, but it says machine wash which is a plus for me.",5
"This blouse drapes nicely. the 8 in the store was too big which is not what i usually find with maeve. i wear a 6 or small in most blouses. i ordered the 6 and it was still too big, so i hope the 4 will work.",5
"I received this dress in both colors (oatmeal and blue) for christmas, and i love them! they are super comfortable and great with leggings. i can wear them just to lounge around the house or dress them up a bit for church. i am 5'10 and 140 lbs and i got the small. it fits true to size. i would definitely recommend!",5
"I have gotten constant compliments on this dress and it is very flattering. i normally wear a large or a size 12 and i had to order this in an xl. i am big busted so that makes the difference.

this could be so easily dressed up but easily made casual with a denim jacket or sweater.

one of my favorite fall purchases.",5
"Love the length and long sleeves. so comfy to sleep in! great purchase, i ordered the navy one too!!",5
This dress is super comfortable and well made. i am 5'10 150lbs and the large was a little too big but with a belt it worked out just fine,5
I originally ordered this blouse to wear for work. i was pleasantly surprised that i could wear it casually with jeans! fits comfortably and hugs my curves!,5
Cute to wear with leggings. i like that it's easy to just throw on. it's fitted at the top and easy to chase kids around but doesn't look too momish or sloppy.,5
"Great shirt! i am a tshirt wearing girl so i like to have a lot of different styles. this is more than a tshirt- great style and thicker than expected. great fit, overall love it",5
"I bought this blouse after i saw my aunt wearing it. the color is lovely. i spilled soup on it during my first wearing and it laundered wonderfully. i am so glad! such an easy piece to throw on, very comfortable. fit is great.",5
"Buy this dress! you won't be disappointed. it's lovely and can be worn in the summer and easily transition to fall or even winter with opaque tights, tall boots, and a denim jacket. the neckline is unique and stunning - demure yet sexy - something that can easily be worn during the 9-5 work day or into the evening. i bought my regular size m and it hits just about my knees. i don't think this dress runs small at all.",5
"Wanted a cooler weather casual weekend errand dress and this is very confortable to wear with artistic leggings and tall boots. pockets are always handy and it is easy to style with a contrast scarf or long necklace. for added warmth can add a full slip or wear alone in spring with sandals. received numerous compliments wearing the first time, so purchased the navy one several weeks later. anticipate wearing these dresses often and when the cotton finally wears down will use as a nightgown. love",5
Perfect top! the color is absolutely beautiful and the fit is better than i imagined it would be! love!!!,5
"For reference i am 5'5"" and 118 lbs. the small fits nicely. the style is flattering. i have a big rib age, so as with many back zip styles that area is a bit tight when i sit down. not too bad though. ican wear it to work and out for a date both. colors are a bit subdued but i will enhance the pink or blue floral tones with a sweater, jacket and jewelry.",5
"Cute but not sure it's worth the price point. i might reach for it in sale, and while it was cute on, i just don't spend that much on a daytime casual dress. i'm sure you could dress it up with heels or something but there's something about this dress that screams casual daytime. still very pretty and flattering! i loved the neckline and detailing there",5
"Tried this dress on in a s and it fit very nicely.  it's a very unique dress and i loved it, but i just didn't know where i would wear it!",5
"I worse this dress to a rehersal dinner and received so many compliments. it was a perfect summer dress.. the colors are true to the picture and beautifil. it is also very well made, comfortable and flattering. i am 5'3' and 130 lbs and i ordered a medium petitte which fit great. it was short but not too short! it will be a go-to dress!",5
"I was walking to the fitting room and i saw two of this dress on a rack- an xs and small. i could tell by looking at it that it runs small, so i grabbed a small to try on. i didn't want to love this dress (it's expensive), but i did. it is so pretty and flattering. i wish it were an inch or two longer, but it's ok. with tights in the fall will be fine. not sure i would wear this to work, as i am a teacher and it is too short for me. it definitely runs small. i am between a 2 and a 4, so i took t",5
"I highly recommend this dress! it is super flattering and i got so many compliments. it fits like a glove and honestly made me look 10 lbs thinner. very romantic and has great movement. the length is perfect, since the top is quite modest, it's nice that it's on the shorter side - makes it a little flirty! i wasn't sure of the pattern at first, but it fit so perfectly that i overlooked it and bought it anyway. by the end of the night i was in love with the pattern. it really stood out and i can'",5
Great top! very easy to wear. looks great with jeans or dressier pants.,5
This dress is very lightweight and great for fall/spring weddings. i received several compliments all night! sits very nice on the waist as well!,5
Love this dress. had to exchange it because it runs a little small. i got the right size and it is beautiful.,5
"This very unique dress is exquisite and so versatile ? suitable for daytime or evening, and will look great with a cardigan and tights for year-round wear. it fits perfectly and seems true to size to me ? i?m 5?2?, about 112 pounds, and got an xs. the description says the dress can be machine washed, but with the delicate trim around the neckline, i plan to hand-wash it carefully. so happy with this purchase!",5
"These are so cute... i went into the store to buy something else and came out with these. i usually wear a 10 and bought a medium. these are also lower price than i expected. also, well constructed. thank you antho!!",5
"Very cute and flattering but i'd order at least one size down. i'm usually a 25/26, and just during the time i tried on the 25s in the store, i could tell they'd loosen up enough for a 24. i'll review more once i have them, had to order since they don't typically have 24s in store, so can't comment on quality as of yet.",5
"Love the jeans! the color is listed as black for some reason but they are definitely blue like the picture. and what i love most is i've always wanted somewhat distressed jeans but for me the ripped jeans look doesn't work. these are perfectly distressed without being hole-y. i also love the length. i'm usually a 29"" person because i love ankle length for boots (tall and short). these are listed i think a bit shorter than that i think but didn't feel cropped. they are also made of some special """,5
"Very comfortable nightgown, love that it had pockets. fit is as expected.",5
"Love the lace back panel, unique design. would not call this blue....definitely more of a grey color, but it is pretty! got size small and it fit well. 5'6"" 140 lbs.",5
"I looked at the other reviews before purchasing and this is the one time it didn't work out for me. a lot of people said to size up, so i ordered a medium and it was far too big on me. i reordered my regular small and it's perfect. it's shorter, obviously, but not so short that it is unwearable. i can't wait to wear this out!",5
"Love this un-basic white top. it's very flattering on, and i love that it's a versatile piece that can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i am usually a size 8 in maeve tops/dresses, but i found a size 6 fit me a bit better in this particular top. if your'e in between sizes, you may need to size down. i definitely recommend this top!",5
"Just fab. great length, great pattern, flattering fit, and even pockets!!",5
"Gorgeous and soft, luxurious feeling sweater! i purchased this in the pink/purple color that is no longer showing as available and just love it. it's unbelievably soft, feels like a blanket. i found that if you sort of fold the neck line under a little, it drapes like a cowl neck a little and not quite as off the shoulder....as it's very cold where i am...can't see wearing it that far off during the winter! that was my solution and i love it! i'm typically and xs, bought the xxs b/c it appeared",5
"What a cute top! i would say true to size. it is a pullover so i went with a 6, for easy dressing. the scalloped tank around the shoulders is unique and lays nicely. i would say the top is a lined in cut. not too swingy at all. a great length to be left out or tucked in. i can think of so many uses for this top, i may grab another to keep on hand. will be adorable with skirts or shorts.",5
"I love workout dresses and skirts. i sport them in both yoga (if they have an under layer of shorts, obviously) and in high cardio classes-as well as for things like tennis. i like the extra breeze a dress/skirt will get you, and find them to be really comfortable. i really like this dress as it is not a super bold color (it is hard to find workout attire that is not neon colored). i prefer things to be a little more relaxed and less ""look at me"" like when i am working out. this dress is flatter",5
"I love a crisp white poplin blouse and this top is perfect in that role. i am between a small and medium in retailer tops. because this top looked a little bell in the model photos, i decided to order a 6. it was a bit snug across the chest. for reference, i am a 34c. i returned it for the 8 and it fit perfect. i'm not sure why this top was offered during the winter because it will likely hang in my closet until april. highly recommend this blouse for summer.",5
"36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms
this is a wonderfully soft and warm sweater. the pink color is heathered with some grey and goes with just about any neutral bottom. the neckline was a little fiddly when i first tried it on, however like one of the previous reviewers i folded the left side under a bit to make an asymmetrical cowl neck, and it lays very nicely and looks great. runs a little big, i tried the medium and it fits perfectly. another great sweater from moth!",5
"Love this. i adore pilcro, great for us gals who have thick hips, thighs and a slim waist. they fit tts and are a great staple for fall. the color says dark orange but they are as pictured, a perfect dark tan. i wish that retailer would buy more size 33 in all pilcro. they always sell out fast and i am always out of luck unless i find them when they first come out. also, please make a full length boyfriend jean pilcro! love.",5
"I haven't owned a skort in years! this one is super cute and so soft! i love the details, the asymmetrical cut and the buckles. i bought it in olive green. it fits really well. i'm 5'5"" 119 lbs with an athletic frame and i purchased a size 2 (my normal size). it fits comfortably around my waste and thighs/but with some wiggle room. 

i'm wearing it today w/ a navy blue/cream floral tank top, white/navy striped vans, and a gold dangly necklace. i love that its a versatile item and i'm looking f",5
"I love retailer clothes, but i've often ordered shirts in an xs that i really needed an xs petite in because of the length and fit through the bust, but they didn't have any petites in the size i needed. i'm at 5'1"", 114 pounds. i got this shirt in xs (not petite) and am thrilled with the fit. the material is formfitting enough to look like a petite, and it doesn't drop below my waist line. i'm thrilled with my purchase!",5
"Agree with other poster. this shirt runs very big. i'm all for a flowy, shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent. i'll be retuning it.",1
"This top is very soft and well made. for my short and curvy figure, it is very unflattering. i considered altering it, but there is no way to do it. it gapes in the front and if you have a waist at all, it won't show because this top is boxy and full in that area. if you are tall and slim, it might be perfect, so give it a try.",1
"A little more see-through than you would think, but has super cute smaller details! also needs to be ironed, a lot.",5
This floral tank looks so cute on. the layered cut is very flattering and i've received several compliments while wearing it. adorable,5
"Really nice thick fabric, yet lays really nice. scarf included, love the poncho style. will get me throught the end of pregnancy and will look great after as well!",5
"This dress is extremely comfortable. the dress is slightly loose under the armpits, but the other than that the overall fit is great. can be dressed up or down!",5
"This sweater is so beautiful, soft, and warm. the neck is a little different and meant to be worn off the shoulder. i don't wear it off the shoulder. if you just work with it a bit it will lay nicely. i get compliments every time i wear it!!",5
"Beautiful skort! true to size and very comfortable. the actual shorts part of the skort is a nice, modest length. they have the appearance of a skirt with the utility and feel of a nice pair of shorts. i can't wait to wear it again! i am very pleased with my purchase.",5
"Great pair of work slacks with a flare. wear these with boots give a very rich look. super flattering cut and flat waist.
highly recommend these for fall through winter!",5
"I bought this in the mauve in my usual size small. i think this sweater is intentionally big and slouchy, so i would say it runs true to size. it is very soft and the weave is airy--not going to be warm enough for a below freezing day but i love the style. the neckline is a bit fussy but i think you just have to wear it and let it fall the way it wants to. the sleeves are long enough to cover your hands. the sweater, when pulled all the way down, covers my butt and half my thighs (and i'm 5'9"" t",5
"I mentioned the sizing is true to size but it should be important to note that they will loosen throughout the day, so when i order another color i will size down one size. the color is as pictured too. 
these are great for casual and business casual wear. so comfortable and perfect and flattering for my shape, athletic with muscular thighs.
can't wait to order another pair.",5
"The sweater runs large, the sweater is designed in such a way that it looks very sloppy. i would never be able to wear it out of the house. however, the material is exceptionally soft and delightful. keeping as its a great stay at home & lounge sweater, but way over priced for this purpose. if you can get the fabric to lay correctly, you're a genius.",1
"I absolutely love this sweater and the color is beautiful! i read through the reviews and purchased a medium as i read that this sweater ran large - i'm very happy i sized down.
i haven't yet worn it and hope that it does stay off the shoulder, as pictured, without having to constantly re-arrange.
great sale price!",5
"I was nervous to order the pants because i didn't think they looked great on the model in the picture. they are by far, my new favorite pants. the fabric is so soft and stretchy, yet hugs my curves doesn't stretch out during the day. i was expecting the fabric to be thick or stiff, but it is very lightweight, yet professional for work. the cut is perfect--i wanted black culottes but i'm only 5'5"" so a lot of them overwhelm me. these are fitted at the top and gradually looser through the thighs a",5
"Very warm and snuggly, gorgeous color, nice fit. i have a little trouble getting the neck to lay right, but managed so it works for work. i can't say enough how toasty it is. very good quality and styling.",5
"I like this sweater. i bought it in small and medium because it was 25% off and i didn't want my size to sell out. im keeping the small. im 5'5"" and 140 lbs and hourglass. the medium was way too much fabric. its still roomy in the small, but its lush looking and soft and will look pretty with jeans and high boots. i ordered the one in the beige as well but i think the lavender color is prettier in person. i think the beige may wash me out. hope this helps.",5
"I am usually a 4 in maeve tops, but i sized up to a 6. i am 5'7"" 127 lbs. it is a crisp white, comfortable, easy to wear tank that requires some ironing or steaming. it doesn't look like much in the photo, but once i saw it in person and tried it on, it was an easy decision to make the purchase. it is feminine and has a pronounced a-line shape to it.",5
"I tried this dress on and convinced myself that i didn't need it. on another visit, i tried again and couldn't resist. it is amazingly comfortable and a great alternative to shorts/jeans/pants. you can dress it up a bit with sandals vs athletic shoes but the fabric does tend toward more festive picnic or outdoor concert vs wedding. i prefer wearing dresses so this is a wonderful addition.",5
This is a super cute top. the online image does not do it justice. the scalloped edges around the arms give it a flirty and feminine look. i got lots of compliments when i paired it with the shorebird pencil skirt. the material is thick enough to not make it see-through and it's pretty tts.,5
"I was a bit skeptical about this lovely sweater, but now that i have tried it on with a pair of skinny jeans and tall boots, i am sold! it is so soft and full of movement. it has a very unique design. the purple color is gorgeous and inviting. i will enjoy this sweater all winter long!! i am usually a small/medium and the medium fits a bit big, but looks beautiful on. the neckline does fold in and adds to the appeal.",5
This dress is amazing and spans multiple uses. i brought it to st. john with me and used it as an after swim dress as well as a going out on the town dress. it is flattering and a light but durable material. the only thing that was even remotely challenging was that i needed to adjust my bra straps to be hidden. overall i loved the dress and totally recommend it.,5
"This top is so fun, but more importantly, it is sooooo soft and comfortable!!",5
"Taking the sweater out of the package i was kind of skeptical because of the shape, but to my surprise it looks like as it does on the model. it does take a minute to figure out how to wear it. i ordered the medium (normally wear a size 8) and is a little long, but goes with my personal style. i love the idea of being able to wear it out without looking frumpy or comfy at home.",5
"This is a beautiful sweater, warm, looks great with jeans as well as more formal work clothes. the neckline gives it a stylish boho twist beyond the traditional. i love the color, and it can function almost like a neutral, complimenting almost any other hues. highly recommended!",5
"Get creative with the neckline or let it fall where ever. this is a purposefully slouchy, uber casual, super soft",5
"This top is amazing. it's a little stretchy but doesn't cling and it's surprisingly flattering on my curvy figure. i have a large chest and the shirt fits perfectly with or without a cami underneath. the material is very soft and the print is vibrant and fun. the shirt does run a little large. the only slight issue i have is that it is a little shorter than i usually like on my long torso. other than that, it's pretty much perfect.",5
"I am always on the hunt for a white shirt that is not too sheer, so that i can wear it without a cami underneath. on that count, this top is a winner!
regarding the fit, it is a shorter top, so i am not sure that it would be able to be tucked in a bottom for most people. i am short waisted, and i wouldn't be able to tuck it in.
in fact, i think it is really meant to have an almost cropped fit.
fyi: 36c (34d), broad shoulders/back, short waist - in a fitted shirt i take a 10/12, but i tried this",5
"Usually i really like deletta and know the sizing and shapes. this top looked pretty in the pics and i thought it would be a nice change from a tee. it was baggy, hung low and the layers just looked boxy and shapeless.",1
"I'm a huge skort fan from way back, but finding a cute skort is harder than finding a needle in a haystack, so when i saw this on line i was excited, and when i saw it in the store, my hopes were confirmed. this is truly a stylish, functional skort!! the diagnol hem is flattering along with the two buckle details. love the pockets. you even get a little bonus pocket. the fabric is a beautiful color (moss) and soft, so it hangs in a flattering manner, instead of bunching up. this skort looks grea",5
"Love this skort. bought it in green in store and am now going to get it in black on line. fairly true to size maybe on the lightly larger side. soft, well made and comfortable! bought size 4, am 5'5"" 110lbs",5
I love this sweater! it is so comfortable and lightweight. i am always warm and i can see myself wearing this sweater without getting overheated. very flattering as well :-),5
"I love this top. the wine color is beautiful, the fabric is soft, the details are pretty, and it fits perfectly. it is long, and will likely look best with leggings or skinny pants and boots.",5
Love this sweater and it is so soft and cozy cause it has a little wool in it...not scratchy at all.  5'4 138# usually wear size 6.  i got a small regular (not petite).  looks great with leggings and skirts not to long for a shorty like me.,5
This is a pretty sweater that is great for transitioning to fall. wear it sleeveless on throw a leather jacket over it for cooler nights. fights true to size. the gray is a very pretty color. great addition to my wardrobe!,5
"This blouse is an all season winner.i bought the taupe and can wear it with or without a cami, under a sweater. alone, with skirts, pants, jeans. i am 5'7, 135# and a medium was perfect although i normally wear a small.",5
"I love this top. it's so soft and the cut is so flattering for a sweater! the sleeve holes are low enough so that you could easily layer underneath it but high enough to be work alone. the knit is a perfect fall thickeness...warm but not too thick. i am 5'11"" 130lbs and i got the medium for the extra length.",5
I ordered the floral blue dress. i am a size 8-10 and ordered the medium. it did not find that it was large on top as others had mention. i love the smoking but would also look great with a belt and boots. it makes a great all weather dress.,5
"I am 5'8"", broad shoulders,can sometimes wear a size 4 depending on the cut. i purchased the size 6 and was a true fit. just enough flow to give you room to move but not too much to make you look larger than you really are. the fabric us light and great quality. perfect for a summer night out. so happy with this purchase",5
"Extremely cute sweater, but after having worn it twice it's already pilling up. i'd expect more for a $100 sweater.",1
"This dress is just lovely--i love the pattern and the cut, and it's very comfortable to wear. i like it because i can wear it just about anywhere, and it's appropriate. you can dress it up or down. i get lots of compliments when i wear it!",5
"This sweater is soft and comfortable. it's the perfect transition piece from summer to fall and in winter can be easily layered. at 4'11 it's a little large and could have sized down to an extra small petite, but still love it.",5
This dress is much larger in person than it looks on the model but i absolutley love it! there is an inner tie that helps taper the waist a bit and the material is gorgeous!,5
"Gorgeous material, great length for tall girls, warm without being too heavy, super soft. i ordered the grey and white in small and have returned them for extra-small. i feel like they run a bit big though i seemed to have gone down a size at retailer in the past year, not sure if its vanity sizing. this is a classic sweater and a timeless staple - elegant and sophisticated. the grey is that nice soft grey that doesn't wash a fair complected person out and is flattering with all complexions. great",5
"Modern, unique, versatile; love it paired with the essential culottes. usually size 4/small but got the xs, otherwise the armholes dipped down too low as did the back hem of the sweater (",5
"Just received this gorgeous blouse and i couldn't be happier! it's stunning! not sheer at all, but light and breezy. i typically wear a medium, sometimes a small, but i ordered the medium since velvet tends to be a little tight in the shoulders on me. this medium is a little roomy so it fits more like a tunic - which is what i've been looking for all spring. the blue is even prettier in person - a true blue. a perfect find!",5
This is the most fabulous sweater ever. i really hesitated spending $368 for a sweater but this sweater is worth every dime! it is soft and luxurious. i tried it over a cashmere cable knit dress and it looks unbelievable -- i also tried it over jeans and it looks equally as good. if it came in another color - i'd buy it too.,5
"I have this in the beautiful spring green/pink combo and i this gorgeous blue/maroon tapestry combo, which is prefect for fall. unfortunately, i bought the green in s and it's still pretty big in the bust area, but they sold out of xs. i was able to get the blue in xs and it fits perfectly. i usually order m",5
"Love this - bought in camel and cream in xs. runs large. cute with jeans & thigh high boots, leather skirt and booties or just casual. so many compliments... great for wearing a sweater but showing off arms....",5
"I see me wearing this dress with more of an edgey look - not going for romantic. smoky eye, skinny dark jeans under it and pumps. swings further from body than i thought.

i'm 5'7"", wear a 34b and am typically a size 2. that's the size i bought. fits well and while pretty, it's made with heft ... not overly delicate - can't see this snagging. it's more of a cotton lace which is why it looks cool with skinny jeans. detail at the neck gives it more interest.",5
"I know you cannot tell from the pictures, but the fabric on this is incredible. it is very light and extremely airy so that it flows when you walk. i am a rather petite individual so it would require excessive tailoring for me to wear this-both in length and in the top. i think it was true to size with this exception-and i wish they offered this in petite. i would have tailored the length if it was only that, but on the top (i am not large-chested) there was a bunch of extra fabric that just lai",5
"I'm pregnant (2nd trimester) and really wanted a beautiful, non-maternity dress. i got this in ivory and it's just perfect. the lace on the sleeves is really comfortable, i love the fit, and i love the length. i got tons of compliments on it. my only regret is that i didn't also get it in slate and i really wishing it would get re-stocked.",5
"This sweater is a beautiful, quality, well-made, piece of art! it looks on, exactly like it looks online. when i ordered it, i was worried that my usual size, xs, might be too tight. however, it is a perfect fit: it is fitted, yet, it still has a comfortable looseness (with some extra room in the length of the arms). for reference, i am 122 lbs, 5'4"", 36-17-36. the color is a perfect match to the pilcro serif navy/marin leggings. of course, i am always apprehensive about stretching and/or shrink",5
"I am very happy with this suit! it is gorgeous and very well made. my only suggestion is to use your normal swimsuit size when ordering rather than their recommendations. i am a 4-6 in dress size but am curvy with a large bust. i went with a medium because i thought there was no way i would wear a small! the medium actually fits great in the waist and bottom, however is small in the top for me. i'm ordering a large to compare coverage.",5
"This sweater vest is the best! it is so versatile! i've already worn it over a dress and recieved compliments all day. the knit is substantial without being to thin or heavy. i love the little flecks of color in the yarn as well! it makes coordinating easy. i thought the faux fur might be too overwhelming or hot, but thankfully it's not at all. runs true to size. worth full price!",5
Love love love this jumpsuit. i can't wait to wear it in the tx summer. it is super fun and elegant. you can dress it up or keep it casual. i am 5'9 155 and wear a 10. it laying quite nicely and doesn't require you to wear heels with it.,5
"I walked into retailer today to buy 2 dishes for a registry. $$$ later i walked out with this dress (and another, ugh). it is so beautiful in person. it ever-so-slightly flares out and it definitely has that 70s feel. i got it in white and plan on wearing it for my rehearsal dinner with tan platforms and a flower crown. for reference: 5'7/got some hips and thighs/148lbs - and i got a medium. would have gotten the small but it was slightly shorter.",5
"These are the perfect pants for the hourglass figure, i needed sz 4 but the store was sold out in my sz plan to order . these pants are light weight and fit in all the right spots , don't show any flaws on legs and i do have them ,but they are very complimentary to my figure . they are also really hip without being over the top or weird.",5
"Great news if you missed out on this tank last year! this s the exact style and cut as last season's buttondown tank released by c&s. 

super flattering fit, not too poofy. it *is* semi-open in the back and the slit goes as high as the last button. super sweet for summer and goes with virtually everything. i reeeeally wish they had this one in more colorways. it's grrrrr8!

for reference i'm 5'6"" 103lbs 34a 25 in jeans and i tried on an xs. last year i purchased an xxs petite and it fits exa",5
I bought this yesterday in store - i agree it runs large and sizing down keeps it from swallowing you.  i typically wear a large and went with a medium.  love the grey color - it will make a nice neutral.  am looking forward to wearing this well into fall/winter as i'm in the south where it takes a while to get cold.,5
"This vest is not only stylish and beautiful, it also has pretty specks of blue and rust and other colors. will go with so much. i love the collar, not too big, not too small, just right. frames the face nicely. can wear with dresses, can wear with skirts, can wear with jeans, can wear with cords, the list is endless. this will make any outfit look pulled together. the accompanying belt or sash hits at hip level, i personally like it more at waist level so i remove the belt and wear without it. f",5
"Love this dress! fits tts. great fitted slip underneath beautiful lace design. i'm 5'6"" the dress (size small), hits right above my knees. very versatile dress, may be dressed up or down depending on shoes",5
Love love this sweater vest! quality is wonderful and the fit is great. highly recommend!,5
"I immediately purchased this dress when it came into store. at 5'7"" it hits enough above the knee to be flirty, but still not too short and is appropriate for me to wear to work. sleeves are fitted which helps to balance the trapeze fit. i'm just concerned with keeping the lace in good condition, but overall i love the dress.",5
I have this dress in white and i have worn it twice for completely different events. i wore it with red heels for a dressy look and then with boots and a jean jacket for a more casual look. i am only 5'4'' and it hit above my knees. it's a soft white that is appropriate for winter wear. love it!,5
Fits perfect.,5
"I missed out on the sherpa vest in caramel last year and didn't want to miss out again - can't wait to wear this when it gets chilly. i am between a s & m but the small was very comfortable. it could be easilly layered over a thicker item, or a t-shirt as pictured. so glad i picked this one up.",5
This is what a bathing suit should look and feel like. no crawling up the cheeks :) no spillage out the front. i would say it's true to size or a little on the large size. i'm 5'4 122 and ordered a medium which was great for me. maybe a small would have been ok but i couldn't be happier. good job! color is true to the pic. quality seems nice and sturdy.,5
"Fun outerwear for the fall. the color is a bit more grey than the photo shows (at least on my screen), but i still think it'll go with a lot.",5
"I got a size xxsp which is perfect although i usually wear a xs petite or xs. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37, 30d/32c bra, with narrow shoulders and torso, a bit long-waisted. the ribbed darby sweater hugs every single curve without being tight. low cut, but not as low as on the model; very flattering neckline. sleeves end about an inch above my elbows and can be folded up.
.
well made, very lightweight knit of 57% cotton, 43% polyester. the ribbing detail is very well thought out. there is bias",5
"Love this dress!!! i agree with the other reviewers, i had to size up one size, but then it was perfect. i'm 5'5, 125 lbs. and the size 6 worked great.",5
"Very flattering. fits tts. love the colors. does not give any lift up or support to breasts.i am a 36 c and i was fine with this. it is so flattering to back and overall a flattering fit i was ok with my breast not being supported and uplifted. if you want support this is not for you. it does look exactly as it does on model in regard to coverage showing some cleavage but very little. i am 5'6"" 127 lbs and not very fit and took a medium. my husband really loves this suit and gave it two big thum",5
"Very cute, very flattering. the peplum is fairly subtle and really works, falling at just the right place for me (i'm 5'5). i got the red and have worn it over a dress and with jeans. the color is deep and works well with my pale skin. the fabric is quality and looks like it will hold up well over time - always an issue with sweaters.

unlike some of the other reviewers, i found it ran slightly large. i am small framed but large-chested and often take a medium in sweaters, but a small is roomy o",5
I bought this top for my daughter and it looks beautiful. it's a pretty jade green color and has a nice flow to it. the back is very flattering as well.,5
"I had originally bought this top in one of your stores and loved it!!! got sooo many compliments!!! while reading my e-mail one night, i saw it on sale!! of course i would have bought it anyway!!! now i have 2 of my favorite tops!!!",5
I ordered this top in rose. (the color is actually more of a cream with navy and yellow stripes but i could tell that from the photo when i was ordering). the fit is true to size and the cut is very flattering. excited to add this gem to my summer wardrobe!,5
"If your looking for something to spice up your wardrobe, this is it. rich in color and a luxurious soft hand but so much better in person. i plan to dress up with a long knit tunic and tights plus over the knee boots or with destructed dark denim and booties. i got the burgundy color and may go back for the blue as well. this is a staple for many seasons to come.",5
"I bought this is a size small, i'm 5'8"" 140 and the fit it perfect. it is a very pretty red and looks very cute on. i'm very happy i bought it but i did buy it on sale otherwise i may have hesitated because of the price.",5
This structured sweater is beautiful and timeless! gorgeous seasonal color and style is classic! i typically order medium but wanted a more flowy look and got a large. great purchase. great fit!,5
"I ordered a m/l in this vest and it fits perfectly. thirst is cozy and stylish. in fact, i ordered the same vest in another color! it's versatile enough to wear with both skirts and jeans. i also think it's a timeless piece that will stay in style for years to come.",5
So lovely.  perfect print / graphic.  want to buy in both colors but the yellow is perfection.,5
"I love, love, love this sweater.  it is slightly fitted so that is drapes beautifully.  notice it has 3/4 length sleeves which is fine for north caroline where it does not really get cold.  i purchased the blue and i wore it with fitted jeans.",5
"This is a perfect change of seasons into cooler (colder!) months piece. 

colors 
the colors are muted, the pattern is modern and stylish, the cut flattering. 

sizing
the sizing is generous, and fit is easy. love length, which is true to the product photo- fitting at about the bottom of my fingertips. i love the coverage without looking too covered.

quality 
it's soft, a great weight ---and the quality seems good. i have already worn it a few times and it is not one of those sweaters",5
"First, i did not notice the description mentioning metallic thread. i was disappointed when i opened the box to find it is a metallic, but actually i'm glad i didn't know because i love it. it does not look cheap and it really works. the pale peachy color is gorgeous and the metallic is subtle enough. the real issue for me is the size. i ordered the small and it is huge. enormous. especially from the back. the seam on the sleeve is just above my elbow so it's almost a bat wing kind of thing and",5
"I ordered both colors in the xxs p knowing that size goes fast. i used to wear xs or xs petite consistently, but this last year, i have found myself needing the smaller size (vanity sizing?) in this case, the xxs p was perfect for me, length was around mid-thigh (could almost wear as a dress if i were younger and not as muscular in my thighs), the waist and chest are fitted but not snug (fitted in the sense that it follows my natural curves). the flower patterns are so cute, it does cut at the p",5
"Loved this vest when i tried it on in the store, and ordered it during the last sale.   i usually wear a medium, and the xs/s fit much better than the m/l.   getting excited for fall!   now if the weather would cooperate, so i can wear this cute new vest!",5
Fit is perfect. body slimming. i'm glad i purchased it.,5
"Love this vest. it is super soft and cozy yet fits and lays well. not bulky, so it's a great piece to layer over flannels. it has a bit of stretch.",5
Im short (5'2'') so it's a little long on me! but it's super cute and i love it!!,5
This is a beautiful light weight sweater. great for the texas weather. the red is a great color for the holidays too.,5
"This is my favorite find of the fall. i got the mustard color and it is wonderful.   very soft, nice shape, unique design. i am usually between a medium and large in tops, but i found that the medium was a little too short for my liking.  (i am  5 ft 8 in tall).  even sizing up, it's far too short for me to wear as a dress as some others had mentioned, but looks great with jeans and boots. the large is perfect!!",5
I love the neckline with the pleated ruffles and tie. it's graceful and distinctive yet still understated.,5
Love my new wardrobe addition. fits perfect and goes with everything,5
"I purchased this sweater in red, it's a deep, rich color and although i usually opt for black, you can see the beautiful details on this sweater much better in the red. i love this item!",5
"This dress is adorable. thanks to everyone who commented that the dress runs small as that's definitely true. i ended up ordering up two sizes and got a perfect fit. i was afraid the wrapped skirt might emphasize the hips too much, but that isn't the case. it adds a bit of quirky style and makes this different from the usual shirt dress. it's great with booties or chunky wedges.",5
Some of the reviews about this being cheap fabric made me nervous about purchasing...but i did and i love it! the material isn't super thick but i like that as i tend to run hot. it's super soft material and feels good on!!,5
This dress is effortlessly chic. i wore it with black tights and booties and it was perfection. will definitely be a casual staple year around.,5
I ordered this in xsp navy with the merlot/burgundy flower and it fits above the knees as pictured. the tunic is medium weigh and has a-line shape with a loose waist and i find it very comfortable. the sleeve are straight cut (not tight) and 3/4 quarter in length. i will wear it with leggings and boots/booties this coming fall.. i find this tunic is well-made and disagreed with one review that it is cheaply made. (wrong color?) fyi: 102 lbs. 32c,5
"This sweater is so much cuter in person than as pictured. i bought the lovely red one today. i got my usual size, xs. i plan to wear it more fitted as a top rather than as a jacket, although i can still layer it if i want. the color is divine. the weight is just right, not too heavy but not too light. sometimes peplums overwhelm me, but this one did not. it hits at just the right spots and is flattering all over, particularly making my waist look small.",5
I do not have an retailer where i live so i ordered this tunic online. the material is extremely soft & comfortable ( not at all itchy). tts. i fell in love with it immediately and can't believe how many compliments i received all day long when i wore it to work ( with some skinny ankle length pants). can be dressed up or down. this is certainly going to get a lot of use this fall,5
"Runs big, but the fabric is nice and comfortable. i had to return first order and order the next size up. it is short in the front but a nice length in the back. it will be a great dress for fall and the color is unique, more brownish orange than red. it will look great with boots!",5
Cute design and interesting back feature. runs a little big and is comfortable and flowy.,5
"I had this on my wish list but saw it as a "" on of"" on black friday....and it just happened to be my sisz p it fit me perfect... if anything it runs a little big but it is great to layer. it can be worn sipped over a cami with lace showing .... or as a regular cardi/jacket over first layer! the detailing is loely! even tho it is 40% off today ( i got it with the 25% off store wide sale), my size sold out before this promo so i am very glad i got it when i did. just in time for all the christmas",5
"After reading all the reviews i thought i would have to size up. went into my local retailer and found this dress in a size 4 burnt orange color (last one in stock). it was still marked $79 so i think thats why it was still there.. i crossed my fingers and tried it on, it fit perfect! not to short or tight in the upper sleeve. i'm 5'4"" so maybe that's why the lenght was fine on me. if you can find this in your local store try it on. it's really cute and comfortable. i also have the front lace up j",5
I have this in both the black and red. great design. very flattering and soft. the red is the perfect color. will get a lot of west from these for many years.,5
"I first saw this vest displayed in the window and admired the colors and weave. i couldn't get it out of my mind, so i had to make a special trip back to retailer to buy it. it is soft and drapes well. looks amazing with denim and boots. i think it will be my favorite fall purchase.",5
"The tunic is very pretty! when i visited antho store, i was just fallen in love with it. 
i purchased purple one because the color is for fall. this is good for straight and slender body type.
please purchase it before it is gone!",5
"This vest is sooo cute!  i bought the red (really a dark burgundy) and it is perfect for fall.  i wanted to buy the other color but it's sold out online.  i'm 5'3"" and the length is fine.  i'm usually an xs 2 or 4 at retailer and the regular xs/s is the perfect size.  i am on the busty side and doesn't make me feel too heavy like some vests.",5
"I love this top! it falls in a romantic and easy way.  it's very flattering and looks great.  i just had a baby two weeks ago so it hides my insecurities and post baby bump.  i had many compliments and felt so comfortable, so ordered it in the green color.  i wish there were more!!",5
This is an awesome pointelle sweater. i love angel of the north sweaters. i bought the small (34b) and it fit tts. the pleats in the back hang without pulling. it also flatters the figure with it's shaping. it is a lightweight sweater in a great shade of red. just love it!,5
"Bought this shirt on sale. it was super cute in the dressing room, and for the first time i wore it. washed it per the instructions (wash delicate with cold water, lay flat to dry) and it shrunk so much i don't think i'm going to be able to wear it anymore. it was oversized and loose when i bought it, so it shrunk a lot. there is also a small hole all of the sudden, that i have no idea where it came from (wasn't there when i put it in the washer). very disappointed.",1
"This is the cutest sweater. i bought it today in black. i cannot wait to wear it. it is a lovely, distinctive knit & just the right weight to layer as shown with a white blouse or with a turtleneck. i tried both the xs and s; and i decided to go with the s as it still emphasized that i have waist, but i could layer it nicely. i am 5'4"", 130 lb. you can always count on angel of the north for great style.",5
"Great too. love it's flow. dolan is a great brand. however it's definitely large and baggy which is fine just know it's not tight. i'm 5' 10"" and 135 and ordered a s.",5
"This is a beautiful sweater/tunic/dress. i ordered in the mustard color, and wearing it will brighten my day on a dreary winter morning. it is so hard to find winter clothes in bright colors. the sweater is soft and not itchy. it is a bit longer than i expected...maybe 35"" (i am 5'7""), but that is just fine! it can be worn with leggings or tights. dressed up or dressed down. i couldn't be more pleased.",5
"I'm 5'3, with a 32h chest. ive always had a hard time finding clothes that fit well because i'm chest heavy. this fits perfectly without making me look bigger than i am and hides my post pregnancy pooch well! 

i usually order a medium at retailer and ordered a medium in this sweater.",5
"Just picked this up at my retailer and i just love it. its totally different than your typical tee. the bottom is more of a blousy silk material and the top is a super soft knit. it lays really well and is long enough to wear with leggings! my favorite part is the t strap in the back. such a beautiful detail and so much fun. my only criticism with this top is where it hits on the bust. im a little more full figured, so the top looks better on me when the silk part isn't under my boobs. kinda have",5
"Great design, beautiful colors, well fitted. got compliments.",5
So much cuter than the picture. i bought a m and i'm a 34c i thought it was comfy n flattering,5
"Love the style of this vest, and an added bonus is how soft it is. every vest is different, though, so if you're shopping in the store, be sure to look at all of them.",5
Comfortable & the color was great. just as it looks in the picture. nice design,5
"I tried both the xs/s and the m/l and found the larger size to be more roomy in the shoulders, and just swish a bit better around the hips. this is a change from many long vests my closet, which tend to be size small or medium, as are my blouses and tops. however, could happily live with either size and color, gorgeous.",5
I purchased the poppy pocket tunic in yellow. the color is perfect and looks great with my dark grey leggings. cannot wait until it's cold enough to wear.,5
"This sweater is the reason i shop at retailer - unique, cute & comfy! the yellow really isn't 'one of my colors' but it's so different that i had to get it. and the cut is so flattering, that i had to go back to get the purple! it may run a tad bit generously; i'm 5'4"", 124 lbs, 34d and originally got the small. i wound up returning and getting the xs. that sizing was slightly more form-fitting, without being clingy.we had a hint of fall weather in colorado, so i immediately threw the yellow versi",5
"I love this sweater. hoping to order the other color. the weight of the sweater is perfect, not too heavy. i also really liked how the sweater lays with leggings because it is not bulky. great sleeve length.",5
"I went to retailer for a pair of pants and walked out with this tunic in the blue motif and the pilcro cords in dark turquoise. this sweater, like the one i purchased last season by the same designer, is well made and the fabric is luxuriously soft (like cashmere soft). am so excited that the weather is finally cooling down to wear it!",5
"I purchased the poppy tunic in gold - it's a beautiful rich color - and overall am super happy with the cut of this sweater. retailer has been emphasizing oversized, flouncy tops for a few years now that do nothing for those of us with small waists/big booties - this top is just the opposite and i hope to see more like it. the wide neck is graceful and the sweater curves in nicely without hugging the body.",5
"Beautifully designed to flatter a women's figure. i love the fit and feel of this classic, but modern cardigan.",5
"Perfect light weght sweater for the holidays. i love the detail in the back. the xs was a great fit for this 5'2"", 115 lb body.",5
"I am super happy with this purchase. this top is so soft with a nice amount of flow. i'm wearing it with a bolero sweater over it, making it wearable in the fall and in cooler weather. i also purchased this top in the gray/green shade and it lovely as well.",5
"Love this top! the fit is so comfortable, and it flows beautifully when you walk. the added bonus is the flirty open back, cross strap design to make even your exit an attention grabber. pairs great with some jean leggings and wedge heels. 
loved it so much i went back and ordered another color.",5
"This super cute sweater is comfy and fun to wear.  i love it as much as last years wool paned sweater tunic, except this sweater is too short on me to wear as a dress.  wonderful with leggings and boots.  i bought the blue in size m regular and my stats are: 63""t/39""c/28""w/35""h/30""i (tall/chest/waist/hips/inseam)",5
"This is my favorite kind of dress: comfortable, unique, and can dress up or down. i am 5'2 and 100 lb, and bought the regular 0 because there were no petites available. it fit perfectly! the material is buttery soft and looks like it will hold up well, and i love the orange-red color. the tie detail makes this dress stand out and i find the cut very flattering. so glad i ordered it!!",5
"Love this sweater! not too long or bulky,true to size. the fabric is super soft, great quality!",5
It's really crazy how much i like this sweater. i am surprised by the weight of the sweater. it is a medium-light weight that will be appropriate year round. it fits perfectly and is very flattering open or zipped. i will wear this as a stand alone top with a tank underneath for now and in place of a spring jacket when the weather is warmer. this is a nice find.,5
"This is a modernized hippie sweater, so beautiful. blue is more for fall but i think the mustard color has more personality. the large flowers add attitude, pockets show comfort. it is soft (part silk fabric) and lays nicely. it is not thick enough for warmth, but there is room for a tissue turtleneck. regular s fits me well (it should be relaxed look, not fitted) and i wear it as a dress with thick tights and boots (i am 5ft2in, 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips, and the hem falls right above my knees).",5
"Usually retailer's designs run small for me, but this large fits great. super comfortable, long enough to wear with leggings. love the back cutout design and fabric choice. depending on bust size, it may seem to sit funny, but it's not meant to be a true baby doll design that sits under the bust. mine looks great :-)",5
"Love this vest!! i bought the red color and absolutely love the feel of the fabric. you can wear it over a variety of clothes..dresses, turtlenecks, long sleeve shirts. perfect staple for the winter and fall!",5
"This top is very cute. the fit is great and the material is very comfortable. i am a 5'7, 135 lbs and wear a 36d and the medium fit great!",5
This shirt was very cute. i ordered it as something to be able to wear to class with leggings and it is perfect. the colors are great and the length is very nice. it will be a nice piece to layer with a jacket for the the fall.,5
I love the style and the flow of this shirt. definitely worth the purchase and very flattering!,5
I have worn this with a tank and shorts and know it will be a great fall piece over a long sleeve tee. the pattern is pretty and the fabric is soft and warm. it can be casual or dressed up. this product is true to the picture- what you see is what you get.,5
"This is an adorable top. i had to have it in both colors. it has a unique shape to it, and the simple details give it so much appeal. the beautiful fall like colors can be layered easily into the cooler weather of the season.",5
"I liked everything about this tunic except the way that it looked on me. the fabric was great - not too heavy, not too light. the design was cute and i loved the colors (i got the yellow). it was cut well, and a good length for me (i am 5'2""). that being said, i am curvy and i felt like i looked even rounder in this top. if i was 6-8"" taller it probably would have been perfect.",5
"So happy i purchased this - it's a gorgeous piece, and perfect for fall and winter. the colors are soft and beautiful, and i feel like this will pair well with a lot of shirts in my closet.",5
"I saw this top and immediately knew it was for me! i love it. and i disagree on it being one season too, i could see making this work all year, for sure. i love the green/gray color and it flows so beautifully, it's perfect! the back wasn't a problem for me, when wearing a normal bra i couldn't see my bra, maybe if this is a problem your bra is up too high on your back, i'm very petite and didn't have a problem with it. i bought a small, could have possibly used a xs but they didn't have it, but",5
Beautiful design and perfect for warm days. it has a lovely open back with the perfect amount of loose fitting flow.,5
"I bought this dress online to wear to work and i did not expect anything too impressive based on the picture of the model. i am really surprised at how beautiful, well-fitting, and soft this dress is. i am in love. it fits snugly, but the fabric is so thick that it is still very office appropriate (i work at a law firm). i ordered the small petite and it comes to the top of my knees.",5
Beautiful dress. lots of compliments. will transition well from summer to fall.,5
"When i tried it on, it was a bit shapeless, but it was on a promo so i decided to get it. i kind off like shapeless. i've worn it three times and washed it gently in the machine as recommended (in a lingerie bag, always) and air dried it. it now has a huge rip on the sleeve seam, and i cannot see how this happened. the inner lining is soft and substantial  but the outer gauze layer is thin.",1
"I love the photo of this and because the reviews were so positive i ordered it. i was shocked when i opened the package. first, the fabric is not the silky rayon cotton blend i was expecting. it looks and feels more like a cheap cotton. it does not have the drape or feel or look i expect in a kimono, which brings me to the second disappointment. it is not a kimono at all. it has no kimono sleeve, no sleeves at all in fact. just a slit in the side of the body of the garment you put your arm throu",1
"As other reviewers mentioned, this sweater is truly nice in person. i love the different patterns from the fabric. the cut is also flattering, not boxy. the collar on me turend the other way around (dark showing), and it also looked nice. i wasn't planning on buying anything, but it was thanskgiving weekend, with, you know, discount :-# not regretting it...

i will wear it many ways: jeans and tshirt for weekends #if i get out of my workout clothes#, but also could be worn over a nice black blou",5
"I tried on the refgular xs and it fit, btu the cut was wring on me, i moved up the dress as though it was cut ""petite"" and what a difference! i will ahve to roder the petite for sure.

te material is a thicker knit, very strectchy and warm enough to carry the dress through winter and spring.
the shoulders are well covered, in a flattering way. the chest area is crossed over ""open"", not stiched close, so yo ucan adjsut as needed. te ""tie"" jsut falls but is attached to the dress on one side, so it",5
I was really excited when i ordered this dress for na upcoming beach vacation but was very disappointed when i finally saw it in person. it reminded me of those christmas nightgowns from the 90s with the red and white ruffles. pass!,1
"I loved this jacket the minute i saw it. saturday sunday is one of my favorite brands. even cuter on than the photo. short back at natural waist long in front . great quality fabric. thick and warm. fits very narrow in sleeves so i went from small to medium to have room for a top underneath. the medium is perfect. back is stylish, solid tweed grey with front pattern wrapped around from front. sleeves and collar a black diamond pattern and ribbon trimmed edge.overall very interesting grey black c",5
"I love these jeans. i am normally a 25 so i went with a 25 petite. i'm 5'4"" and the length was perfect. the 25 was a little big so i'm going to order the 24 petite and compare. they r a great material and very stretchy",5
"Great comfortable dress with style! this ran a little large, so i returned for a medium! so glad i did!!!! you can dress down with a pair of low sandals and sun hat or dress up with some heels and hair pulls back!",5
"This is a really beautiful kimono. soft and flattering. as well as eye catching.
can be dressed up or down.
absolutely recommend",5
Love this sweater. the hi-low length is fun. the elbow length sleeves are great. wish retailer offered more colors! low part of the sweater is a touch clingy at first but stretches well. works well with jeans or leggings. overall perfect layering piece for all seasons.,5
What a great piece. so unique and so cool and made with high quality textiles. i expect this to be in heavy rotation. can go super casual/luxe with leather joggers or upscale with nice jeans and some heels.,5
This sweater is so cute!!! i intend to wear it as much as possible. the little elbow patches are a cute detail. it's warm but classy.,5
"I ordered this on sale in blue as i had missed it online. i wore it this week during our heat spurt in cali and was shocked how incredible comfy and cute this was with my skinny jeans. it was perfect for the warm day, as well as the snapping evening meeting i had to attend on an outdoor patio... i will love wearing this from spring into summer. i do hope they bring it back as i would love the beige too!.",5
Loved the colors but the fit was less to be desired. very wide under arms & too much material. looks more like a maternity dress. i ordered a small petite & would have needed the xs but now it is no longer available. oh well. returning this.,1
"Beautiful shorts. make you feel like a million dollars. love love love them!

the robe to match is also adorable.",5
"This is one you just need to see in person! stunning, detailed embroidery everywhere, gracefully oversized, very bohemian, light, airy and dreamy. this kimono was mine the second i saw it! white on white is classic...and this cream embroidery is beautiful. the kimono is very oversized. i'm normally a l or xl and this was plenty roomy. it's also quite long. nearly came down to my knees and i'm around 5'8. if there is an option for petite i'd recommend it to shorter gals! can't wait to pair this w",5
"I'm short, only 5ft and this is beautiful and flowy. it's just below my knees and i think it's perfect. i have only worn it twice out and literally everywhere i went i received a compliment, and asking where i got it. it's unique and no one else carries one like this. i know some customers mentioned the price being a bit high but i disagree. i would rather pay for something that i love, that has good design and quality instead of 50 or 60 for a so so product. that's what i love about retailerpolog",5
"This is a lovely jacket. i thought it was going to be thicker, but it's so classy and chic. i got several comments on it, and i've only worn it once! great jacket to have in my closet. i can wear it to work, to dress up an outfit for school, or to complete an outfit.",5
"I spotted this dress at my local retailer. to be honest, i saw it on a rack with a sale sign on it and didn't think much of it. then i saw it on a salesperson...wow! i think this dress looks much better on someone than on the hanger...so i recommend trying it on.

i am 5'3"", 32b...and i bought an xs. it fits really well...right about the knee, similar to how it is shown in the photo so taller women may find it to be a little shorter.

the ruffle/fabric that comes down the side adds an interesting",5
"I ordered a xxs as i am a size 0. it fits very well, i am 5'5"" and the dress hits me 2 inches above knee. i would wear this with thick tights and boots. the sleeves are unlined, but because the material is of high quality, it does not seem too shear. you can belt this dress if you do not like the loose, swing style. i love the print and colors. i was not really aware of the silver sequence at the hem, but i do not mind it. however, i feel it does dress it up taking it out of the every day wear c",5
"Did want to love this jacket because i have so much black and white, but i saw it on my daughter and had to have it. i usually take a large, but i needed an extra large, and the fit is great. the material is not too heavy, so i know it can wear it year round by adjusting the weight of tee underneath.",5
"I had such high hopes for this dress, but unfortunately it misses the mark completely. the design is flawed in that you cannot raise your arms to shoulder length. for someone who is 5'3, 105lbs, the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander's derelict campaign. i think one must have a specific body type for this dress, but regardless, they'll have to keep their arms at their sides.",1
"After eyeing this online several times, i saw it at my local store. in person it is just so pretty. it does have a romantic look to it. i wasn't looking for it... the sa was wearing it! she is much taller than i & it draped nicely over her denim jeans. says she loves it & just had to have it. well, of course, i was going to try it too! at 5'3"", 117#, it was to my knees in the front, longer in the back. a little on the overwhelming side. love the crinkly fabric, embroidery detail, short sleeves &",5
I love this sweater and don't think the pics do it justice. i ordered the light blue/lavender color and couldn't be happier. it's great with leggings or jeans and booties or boots. i received many compliments the one time i've worn it so far. so glad to have snagged this on sale but i wouldn't have hesitated to pay full price!,5
This kimono is gorgeous and i've gotten many compliments. it looks good with a t-shirt and jeans or with something dressier. i love it.,5
I am very surprised by the low reviews of this dress. this dress is obviously a very loose fitting style. it is a bit of a man repellar dress.the quality of the fabric is beautiful and the pattern stunning. i find the loose flowy style liberating and comfortable. i love it with otk boots and tights for winter but also planning to wear with sandals in spring. i am 125lbs and purchased the petite small.,5
This is great and very soft inside. i am wearing it around my house all the time. great over workout clothes or jeans and leggings.,5
"The pictures of this dress are terrible compared to seeing it in person, and i instantly fell in love with this dress when i put it on.  the fit is very flattering with a touch of 1920s flare. the colors are better in person too, with the lightest color being pink, not white as pictured.",5
"I love that retailerpolgie has petite sizes now. i am 5'4"" and 115lbs. i bought the 0p and it fits perfectly. the dress is very cute and the colors are a way to transition into fall when its still warm out.",5
I would have bought this had it not been for the way the pockets are sewn in. they are attached on the inside by a string. if the string broke the pockets would dangle. for the price you would think they would have sewn pockets in to the vest. too bad.,5
"The color, heft, style & quality are perfect. i did go down one size since my usual size was too large in the waist.",5
The online pic does not even do this beautiful blouse justice. in person it is stunning and goes with everything.,5
I tried this on at the store - the fuzzy trim around the bib is adorable and the overall texture with little puffs woven into the fabric has a nice quality feel to it. the pattern of flamingos is fun and the fabric is soft. it does run on the big and flowy side. i thought it was very cute and comfy but ultimately did not buy it because the price is rather high and the petite length is sold out. i'll snap it up if it goes on sale.,5
Lovely small whale cords. they fit too tight around the waist for me. unfortunately i will have to return.,5
"I just bought these jeans today & they are really cute & comfortable on. i love pilcro jeans as they fit really well, they are made well & they are always on style. i did have to go down a size as well but they fit beautifully! comfy & stylish!",5
"I've been trying on ""boyfriend"" jeans for more than a year, finally found a pair that fit and were comfortable. many of them had no stretch at all and were very uncomfortable. these have just enough stretch, but not too much. i usually wear a 29-30, tried on the 29 which were comfortable but too loose at the waist. the 28 were a perfect fit.
i'm 5'8"", 140lbs.",5
Never would have thought i would love it so much based on the picture online but saw it in person and it's so cute!!  colors are very rich in person - even the soft pink (not a big pink gal) works so well with the other colors.  great quality with full lining.  i lucked out and picked it up for a steal on clearance with another 40% off!  just love it!!,5
"Pilcro is an incredible denim brand and i've never been disappointed. these are no exception. minimal distress, perfect length (i'm 5'8 and they hit just like the model), great color and super comfy! they have some stretch to them and definitely fit baggier, so depending on how you want them to fit...i sized down for a snugger fit. these are fantastic!",5
"Love this dress! great for dressing up and down or just to throw on for the weekend. the fit is very flattering but i will say the fabric is very thin so you must use a slip, it's totally see through.",5
"Maybe i didn't read the description correctly, but i was surprised that this skirt has two front slits, thigh-level, rather than just one, as shown in the photo above. it's gorgeous silk, the patterns are vivid, and the pleats are classy, giving just the right balance of form and flow. however, when i sat down, very little coverage!! ...which means i wouldn't wear it much. i considered taking it to my tailor, but too much effort and $$. however, it's beautifully crafted if you're looking for som",5
Very soft color and soft to touch. the material is light and airy and it feels great on. i wear a medium and bought the small. i would definitely buy this in another pattern if they made it as cute as the flamingos.,5
"I saw this skirt online and loved the vibrant colors, pattern, and style. it looks even prettier in person. the material is light and soft. the skirt is fully lined so you don't have to worry about it being see-through. also, the skirt is a good length for me and won't drag on the floor. happy with purchase. recommend.",5
"Only worn this once but had multiple compliments! such a cute pattern and style. only complaint is wish they would have done the sides with a split. it kind of wants to hug the hips and then be too wide in the middle. still, love it!",5
This top runs a tad big. it's beautiful in person and sooooo soft. definitely an retailer staple top. material and cut is great,5
"I really love this top! it is soft, lightweight, and really pretty. it has quickly become one of my favorites!",5
"Exciting design, beautiful fabric. love this dress",5
"I definitely agree with the other reviewers who said this top is better suited for someone tall and slender. the design on the lace is beautiful and i love the scalloped hem. but it is somewhat boxy and flowy, which didn't seem to work on my curvy body proportion-wise.",5
"I bought this dress for work and receive tons of compliments when i wear it! the material is soft and breathable, which makes it comfortable to wear all day at work with a light jacket. i do agree with the other reviewer though, it does show every bump, especially in the tummy. i also noticed that some of the fabric flaps will flip up when i sit down, but i am going to sew the flap down so it stops doing that.",5
"Fun fun fun. love the polka dot, but also the cut on this skirt is very flattering and retro. it is perhaps a little yellower on the ivory side, but neutral nonetheless... te fit is very flattering, 0p fit waist, hops, length (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist) i think i will have to keep this lovely item as i doubt it will make it to sale in my size!",5
This skirt is really beautiful and well made. the color is a cream/off white like other reviewers mentioned. it fits mostly true to size--i have a straight build with a wider stomach and no hips and my usual 4 fit a tad tight in the waist but perfect in the hips. i just love this skirt.,5
"I can't wait for the first signs of fall so i can wear this! the fabric is a nice light weight and the fit is very flattering. as another interviewer commented, it can also be worn as a dress. well worth the investment!!",5
"I sat on this top for about 2 weeks waiting for more reviews to see if it was worth buying.  i finally took a chance on it and i'm glad that i did.  this top is really cute.  i love the asymetrical pattern.  it's long enough that it goes great with my black skinny jeans.  the v neckline is perfect...not too low.  i got this in my usual size large and it fits perfectly.   i wish that the sleeves were slightly longer, but that shouldn't be a problem for someone not as tall.  it's a quirky and ador",5
"I ordered the navy, which is really stunning, by the way-and the cream. i asked my husband to choose the color for me and he asked me to keep both of them! there you have it. that should say it all! it is a beautifully done lace with an attached camisol liner which, if i'm not mistaken is on snaps so that you can remove it and wear your own cami if this one has a weird fit for you. the navy is really pretty due to the stark contrast of two shades of blue. as i said, my husband saw the cream colo",5
"Eva franco has done it again by creating another fabulously flattering, unique, and compliment grabbing skirt. it runs true to size and is very easy to move in and wear. this is my 10th skirt of hers and i love them all.",5
"I bought this top in ivory and love it! i'm 5'5"" 125lbs and 32dd. i usually wear a small or 4 but sized up to a 6..i have no issues with the fabric!! this is a steal for the sale price.",5
I totally thought this was a dress when i tried it on and bought it in the store. there is a drawstring on the inside to cinch the waist making it look so cute as a dress.,5
"Love! boys and arrows make amazing suits! i wear a 25/26 in jeans and a size small in this bikini bottom - it actually fits true to size, which seems impossible in swimwear! cheeky for sure, but so cute! fabric is super, super soft. i want to wear these all day long.",5
"In true cloth & stone fashion, this product is incredibly soft and comfortable. i bought mine in petite small, but it will flatter a number of different body shapes and sizes. it's easy to launder (machine wash), and it will work as a perfect piece to dress up or down, depending on how you accessorize the product. i can't wait to wear this while i'm on the go and traveling over the summer.",5
"Yes, like the photo suggests, this piece has a lot of the features of a jacket. but, i bought it to also wear as a dress. let me explain...

fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, high waist, dress/top size 10 (without buttons, etc.) or 12 (fitted at the bust and waist), bottom size 6 (upside down triangle), 5'2""

i bought the small in this piece, because it is big enough to wear as a light jacket while also being fitted enough to wear as a dress. on the inside of the piece, there are strings that",5
"This dress is so soft and comfortable. i love shift dresses and find them flattering. this one did not disappoint in that area. it is long enough for work and hits just above my knee. finally, the colors are great. the shades of blue, muted red and peachy pink are lovely.",5
"I'm 5' tall and 95 pounds and ordered this in an xxsp.  it's a little loose but still looks really attractive on my body.  it's warmer and thicker than i thought it would be and lined.  i love it!  taller petites might want to size into regular because even on my super-petite body it hit a few inches above the knees - perfect length for me but will hit higher for those taller.
it's going to become a staple!",5
This top is so much cuter in person. it's light and airy and very feminine. can be worn casually or dressed up. definitely not as full/baggy as it appears in the photo.,5
I bought the blue & white one and it is so very comfortable! it will look with my blue jeans and in the summer with my white leggings! great quality at a good price.,5
"I bought this tunic is blue. it is now one of my favorite tops to wear with skinny jeans or even leggings. i have always love rayon. this top did not disappoint me. it feels very soft and silky which makes it perfect for warmer days. for reference i am 5""1' 125 lbs, the xs p fits me just like the model...lose and not too long. i love it so much that i am considering another in different color.",5
I purchased the blue & white pattern of this shirt. the color blue was bright and contrasted perfectly with the white color in the square design. this shirt worn with a white pair of slacks or a white skirt makes a perfect presentation for any occassion during the warm spring and summer months. the fit of the shirt was true to size. i love the longer length of this shirt because it elongates one's height. the cuffed sleeves are perfect in length. the classic style of this shirt guarantees many y,5
"I love hte green color, it is so vribant. i tried it on in regualr size, thinking i could order petite, but they sold out... waht a bummer.

fit is very flattering, and i find it comfortable.",5
"Flattering cut, perfect for work or play. even better yet, it was on sale! if they had it in other colors i would buy it! beautiful high-quality garment like all the others i have purchased at retailer!!!",5
"I just saw this in the store and had to pick it up. i just love this green color and can imagine it going with a number of different types of tops/dresses. i personally think this looks best with a chambray button down shirt with this vest over it, paired with slim fitting black pants and boots.",5
"I splurged on this dress (still a bit pricey, even on sale), but so far it's the best purchase i've made all summer. the terry is a somewhat unusual choice for a dress that otherwise would have been on the fancier side, but it makes it sooooo comfortable--it's even more breathable and lightweight than the super thin cotton sundresses that usually dominate the summer. my only real complaint is that the cut is a bit out of whack. the medium just barely fits my hips, but it's pretty loose on top--y",5
I love these pants. they are really comfortable without sacrificing style. perfect for the office or just running around. i'm 5ft 9inches and 165 lbs. i bought the medium which fits perfectly.,5
"These culottes are comfortable and cool. i am a size 8-10 and am 5' 4"" tall. i ordered the medium. the hemline hits me a little bit longer than the model. also they are more of a bell shape on me rather than kind of a straight pant as shown on the model. the pockets are great!",5
Super comfortable and flattering casual jeans. i'm 120 lbs 5'7 normally size 26 and the 26 fit perfect.,5
"This top is fantastic. something about it has an ease of elegance and grace. the overall structure and design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to wear. i feel immediately put together and ready for anything. the fabric has great texture and flows well without feeling like the wind will carry you away. i purchased the off-white - it is a bit see-through, but i don't mind wearing a cami underneath.",5
"Amazing color- true to picture. it runs a bit large, even with layering underneath. i'm usually a 10/12 / l / 34d in tops and i needed the medium for a nice fit. i'm long-ish in the torso, and this sweater fits just slightly cropped, so really perfect with a longer button down underneath. the buttons on the back are a nice detail.",5
These capri length pants are awesome!  i do recommend sizing down though as the l was really big on me (i am a 10-12 with most of my weight in my rear so normally never size down in pants)--the fabric is really nice and the print is versatile and allows wonderfully for pattern mixing.  super comfortable!,5
I wear this top with jeans or cords. i allways get compliments. it's comfortable and versatile. go down a size!,5
Super flattering! stretch a little with repeated wear but not as much as other pairs. i love these!!!,5
"This is a stunning top but it did not work for me because it looked like a maternity top on me.. i think a person needs to be thin with a small bust to carry this off. this would look good with many things, from ripped denim to leather pants, and is not necessarily just for holidays.",5
"Love the fit and comfort of these jeans!!! better than my 7's and citizens. the distressing is perfect, i don't have to worry about enlarging a knee hole. like another reviewer noted the color is lighter in person. they fit true to size for me and kept their shape a 3 wears. wish a knew about these before!!",5
These jeans are so soft! fit is great and i love he higher waist as well. i can tell i will be wearing the heck out of these.,5
"Noticed all the 5 star reviews online for the latest pilcro stets- so due to the past 2 years of dissapointment of what was once a great pair of jeans....i was hopeful that retailerpologist listened and went back to the original pilcro stet formula- thick denim, just the right amount of give and a flattering 10 inch rise. walked right in and found them- and i knew right when i touched them- they were still the thin denim that's nowhere near the quality they once were. consumers pay attention and t",1
"Love this top! i've worn it once and received several compliments. i'm 5'7"", 127, and the small fit well. i'm happy with my purchase.",5
"I really like this dress, i wish they still had xxs p as the xs p is still a little big (i guess ti is the style). i love the eyelet design, the high low is very flattering, and the neckline too. very comfortable. i am not sure if i will keep it as i still think the xxs p would be more flattering, but i like it enough to consider keeping the bigger size.

nice with a jeans jacket and brown clogs!

(115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist)",5
This is a beautiful top. it is something great to have in your wardrobe for the holiday season or a nice date night option. i highly recommend it. it runs true to size. the price is actually reasonable as far as dressy retailer tops go as well!,5
"I wear these pants 3-4 days a week. i work in advertising, so they go perfectly with the polished/ trendy/ casual office attire that is required! they are simply the most comfortable jeans i own-- and also make me look slimmer without looking too tight. they are a unique type of material, a soft but structured stretch weave-- so more polished than normal jeggings-- and smooth over bumps, while still highlighting subtle curves. the zippers at the bottom add an edgy polish, but also provide a more",5
I got this dress in coral and i absolutely fell in love with it the moment i tried it on. the fabric is very soft and flows nicely. i am 5'3 and i got it in regular but the length is not too long or short. i can probably wear it with my flip flops.,5
"These pilcro's jeans are so good!!! love the fit, the color, and the feel. i am a curvy girl and these are great, they hit me just right. now pilcro jeans used to strech out really bad but they seemed to have fixed the problem.i wore these jeans at work for 10 hours and they did stretch some but not a dress size, so i would buy the size you feel the most comfortable. i think these are a no brainer!",5
"When i received the dress, it was true to size on the bust and length. i didn't purchase the petite, but i wish i did since i am 5'2. i tried to wear my wedges, but it's still long. i love the dress and would definitely recommend it.",5
Beautiful top runs true to size. i&#39;m in between an xs &amp; small and went with the xs. it fit great and was beautiful for holiday photos. it has hints of silver in it.,5
"Seriously the best jeans i have bought in years - better than my favorite paige and ag stevies. i sized down from a 27tall to a 26tall and they still aren't super tight, i think maybe some could even go down 2 sizes - i do still have a lot of room in the waist but i am pretty straight through the hips. i am almost 5'10 with long legs and the tall is a great ankle length and fits me like the model. wonderful stretch, comfy, great color and awesome ""ageing."" i don't normally like the ripped jean l",5
"This top is way more sparkly and festive in person. i plan to pair it with black or charcoal gray pants for a holiday party, but it would also go great with dark jeans. it is super cute, can't wait to wear it.",5
"Great fit, runs maybe a tad big but overall great fit/quality.",5
It's such a pretty top but i felt that it looked maternity-ish so i returned it.,1
"I purchased another top, same brand, in the same style from retailer and really love it. the fabric is lightweight, which makes it great for multiple seasons. i travel extensively and these tops hand wash and hang to dry very nicely. i wear a gray tank under this one and love the look. i also like the long length. as usual, i will probably tack the neckline up an inch or so, so that it's not so low - just my thing. overall, the pattern and the fabric are very nice. i usually wear an xs or s; i pur",5
The fit on these is amazing and the color is great too! sometimes the fading is too much on jeans but this is just right. the rise fits really well and the length is great! love pilcro!,5
"I purchased the moss green version of this sweater in a m petite. i""m 5'3, 135 lbs with a full bust. i love it! it fits beautifully, and i have received many compliments on it - from both friends and students (and for a high school teacher that's high praise).
when i saw the purple version i debated...two of the same very distinctive style? the answer was a resounding yes! can't wait!
the only minor warning about the sweater - it was very itchy on me the first time i wore it. second time - ok!",5
"I loved them on when i got them, but they literally frayed apart on my body as i wore them, and i had them on no more than 5 times. it was not a fit issue or a seam issue; they literally just frayed apart in two areas.  while flattering and incredibly comfortable, the fabric was not at all durable...they are not your typical  denim,  they almost kind of a knit feel them.",1
"These jeans are awesome, as most of the reviewers have already noted, they are tastefully aged to look modern but not so ripped that i look sloppy. they fit true to size with retailer's recent sizing. i used to wear a size 26, but in the last couple of years i have had to move down to a size 25 even though i am still the same size and weight??? anyway, i bought these in a size 25 and they are perfect! i have not worn them all day yet so i cannot comment on whether they stretch out after wea",5
"It's rare to find clothing made of quality fabrics, and this is a fine, soft wool blend. the design is feminine without being over-the-top, and the fit is slightly loose, as pictured on the model. i would not recommend wearing it with a belt, as pictured; it makes it look too ""trendy"" and detracts from the shape of the cardigan, which is beautiful on its own just skimming the body. it is a perfect topper and can work for daytime or an evening out. really lovely, and one of the few things i decid",5
"Normally i would not have bought this color and print, it is just not a color that i usually wear. but after reading reviews i ordered it online. i love love this top. it looks good, is flattering, and is a very nice and different color. i wore it with berry leggings and love it. the top is very comfortable, can be worn with pants and leggings. the only issue i have is that since the jersey fabric is only at the back and not in the front, it pulls at the tummy section in the front and shows an o",5
Ordered these in a size 32 and they fit perfectly!,5
This top is both cute and flattering. it is also soft and the colors are gorgeous. i highly recommend,5
"I got this when it went on sale (in navy and coral colors), awesome dress for any occasion! as far as complaints go about the straps, its meant to be low-cut! i really like the basket weave bodice although that does make it more difficult to zip up, but i found it was easier to just slip the dress on zipped up since the stretchy fabric gives quite a bit rather than deal with the zipper. i normally wear about a 0-2 in most retailer brands and have the dress in both sizes (didn't notice a big differ",5
I am in love with pilcro pants. i am typically a petite 26 or 27. i'm a 27 in these khakis. which is could have them in every color and style.,5
True to size so great fit from top to bottom. i am 5'5'' and it hits my hips at just the right spot - not too high or too low. it also does not flare out too much so it will not give off the impression that you have something to hide in the tummy area. it is very soft and comfortable. the material is not fragile so it should be easy to maintain its shape after washing.,5
"Amazing style, great fabric and a dress for all occasions. bought the black and love it!",5
"Beautiful! soft, flattering but not clingy~ i bought in the green which is not a typical color in the summer palate which makes it all the more appealing.",5
Love love love these!! the model does not do them justice since she makes them look like high rise pants. they are very soft with 15% stretch which is why i sized down . i usually wear a 30. you can remove the roll and they fit perfect w a heel . for those curvy women they look great! also have a slouchy appeal too but tailored . i went everywhere looking for chinos and these are the best ones out there!! for reference i am 141 pounds and 5'4 just losing weight from having a baby and absolutely,5
Bought these in store and bought another on line. super comfortable and great for a casual look. great length as well! love the pilcro line.,5
"After reading some reviews about it running small i decided to order the 8 instead of my regular size 6 and bingo! i'm 5""7' 144 lb. dress hits right above my knees. i'm between slender and curvy.",5
I tried a pair of the hyphen chinos on at retailer and loved them. they are comfortable and a great casual look. i bought two more pairs in different colors on line.,5
I looooove these pants. i was looking for a cool pair of white pants since last summer. i tried them on and they make my bootie look great. they are also not see through which i love. i love this brand and these pants will be my new summer staple! ps. they were a bit snug then relaxed a little after 2 wears.,5
I saw this in the store and immediately loved it even before trying on. the style is classic and the fit is perfect. the material is soft and comfortable. it hugs without clinging. i tried on the black in s and the green in xs and went with the green. different shoes and accessories will dress this up or down. i plan to travel with it several times this summer. it will be a great option to wear on the plane and arrive looking chic.,5
Love these pants. they are comfortable and flattering. i generally go for neutral colors but the blue is a beautiful shade that's easy to wear.,5
"Thank goodness chinos are in this year. i was so excited when i saw these pants, and they did not disappoint when i put them on. the material is so soft with a decent amount of stretch in them, making them incredibly comfy. they fit true to size and are very flattering - not too baggy or frumpy looking. i purchased the rose colored pants, which are basically a light nantucket red color. for reference, i am 5'8"" and ~135/40 lbs and bought a size 28. i'd be very surprised if i don't end up purchas",5
"These pants are my new ""go to"" . i am 5'6"" 122# and the 25 fits perfectly. they do give a little. 

lots of colors to choose from. i have the washed blue and am thinking i need to get more colors!",5
"I tried on the xs in store, but ti was a little big on me (and i usually get petite in dresses, unless they are mini dresses).
so i decide to order the xxs petite. it fits much better. the length is, at the highest point, just above my knees. the chest part fits better on me as xxs p, the plunge is not low, not too high, and is flattering, i can wear a regular bra that can attach as t-back and you won't see anything. 
the model on the picture is what it looks like as a usual size (so xs instea",5
"I bought a pair of these in stone and after the first wash they become all splotchy. i chalked it up to perhaps there was bleach leftover in the my washer. although nothing else in the load was blotchy. i then, because i loved the cut of these pants, bought another pair in the darker blue color. the same thing happened after the first wash. again, nothing else in that wash load was the least bit ruined -- just my new retailer pants! such a bummer-- definitely a dye issue. i called the stores i pur",1
I went with the xs because i didn't want the v neck in the front to be too low. it looks cute paired with a kimono and a necklace.,5
I have these in 3 colors and i always wear a 27 in pilcro. i could probably size down but i like them a little loose. they are great to have in the spring and summer. they are very soft and very comfy.,5
"So to put this in some perspective, when i tried on this dress for my husband after bringing it home, he described it as ""possibly the best dress you've ever bought."" so that's definitely a winner! i think what makes the dress great is that it's not clingy, but still had a good drape. on the skinny models, it looks large and flowy, but on my curvier body, it draped beautifully and is super flattering, without being clingy or too tight. i'm usually a size 10, 36ddd, and i sized down to a medium s",5
I cannot say enough about these chinos. i hope retailer will keep them around for a long time despite the news that says retailer is going the way of jcrew. these pants are more stylish and comfortable than any other chinos i have owned. i am a teacher and being comfortable and stylish at the same time is important. i am a 10 to 12 and a 30 fits me fine. please please retailer keep making these every season in fun colors!!!,5
"I generally love pilcro pants and these are no exception. the fabric is heavy but soft, the color is so vivid but still easy to mix with other top combinations. they are comfortable and flattering. i am 5'2"" and these are not crops on me, with the rolled up hem they are a perfect full length pant but that works well for me.",5
"These pants are a life saver. i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink, rolled in a towel, and hung dry with good results. picro does not usually fit me well, these pants are the exception. i'm 5'6 and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length. great for a baseball game!
i will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them!!!!",5
"I recently bought this is a medium black and it is a perfect fit.  it's a beautiful top and the peplum portion is perfect and long enough for someone with a lon torso.  for reference, i'm 6ft 175lbs and usually wear a 10/12 or medium/large top.  i went with the medium based on other reviews. i  i was lucky to find this on sale.",5
My husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking. they are going back asap!,1
"Bought the gold pair and dripped something on them so spot cleaned them with water only. my white washcloth turned bright yellow. the food came out but surrounding area was super faded. so i returned them, took the second pair home, wore them a few times, they stretched out so much, washed them in cold water and they have splotches that are really light. these pants are way too much trouble.",1
These pants are amazing. they are so comfortable and fit true to size. i typically wear a 28 or 29 depending on the pants and the 28s fit me perfectly. i bought the olive green pair and they are everything i have ever wanted in a pair of olive pants. i love that they are tighter in the butt area and loose in the knees and calves so they are not restrictive. i want every color!,5
"I bought a pair of these a month ago and first time i washed them they came out with light spots all down the leg. i figured i did something wrong so i bought another pair in the same color and one in sage. just washed both pairs according to care instructions (no spills, stain remover, or anything but detergent) and both came out with light spots all down the leg. very sad to have wasted all that money.",1
Perfect for a hot day and skins the body beautifully. so soft! i am usually a medium but got a small which fit perfect. usually swing dresses do not compliment the waistline but this one did!,5
"I've been looking for colored pants and these are the best!

i am typically a 10 or 12 in pants and the 30 fit well. i tried on the rose color and loved those. the fit was great, though they wouldn't be long enough on me if i tried to unroll them (though you can). i liked how they fit my butt, hips and thighs, which is usually the most important part. i find that lots of colored pants accentuate the cellulite on my thighs too much, but that was not at all the case with these.

the fabric is",5
Bought these and they fit really well and are super comfy. love the color. will probably live in them this summer!,5
"I purchased this in the gold in-store. when i got home and saw it also came in turquoise, i ordered those right away as well. the fit is amazing. the pants are very slimming without being tight. they are a comfortable and flattering pant. i really love the colors and will probably snag another pair or two when able. these are a great pant to dress up or just look snappy casual in. they are a great versatile pant. i normally wear a size 8 and weight 155. the 29 fit perfectly.",5
"Do not waste your money on this.
at first, i bought pilcro hyphen chinos short and i loved it. so i bought this pants in store too. i laundry them yesterday and they both came out colorless. i was so shock. 
fyi, i did not use bleach or chrolox, i mean i don''t use them.i will return them both.
still mad. this is bad quality enough worth it.",1
I wore these pants to work and they fit and looked great! however the first time i put them through the wash they became all discolored and are completely stained and now are unwearable. very disappointing. did not spend that much money to wear a pair of pants once.,1
"I am going on a trip to south africa in may and needed pants that were cute, durable, yet comfortable and not frumpy. these are definitely the ones i was looking for. the fit is great - not too tight and not too baggy. i got them in three colors and all of them match what is on the site. i definitely recommend these chinos as you will be able to wear them to lots of different places - dressed up or down.",5
"Bought this in the green because i thought it was a bit different. it is super flattering and the fabric is so soft and comfortable. i have it in an xs and a s and haven't yet decided which i am keeping as they both work. i'm 5'4"" and 116#. going to wear it on an upcoming trip and i think i will get a lot of use out of it during the rest of the summer into the early fall. i saw the black too and am tempted to buy that as well. have i mentioned i love this dress?",5
"Do not buy these pants!  the first time i washed these pants i ended up with big faded spots, and i followed the washing instructions.  i bought another pair and the same thing happened.  i'm out a bunch of money!",1
These were my go to work pants. i have 10 pairs. so disappointed that you are not making them in tall anymore. i will have to look elsewhere when buying pants. please bring them back,5
"I find these to be nearly perfect. the quality is idea--soft, yet sturdy. the stitching is unique based on the color--which i love. and while they're super machine-washable, i never need to iron them for a business-casual look. i tend to like things on the baggy side, so as a 5'7"" gal with about 120 pounds on me, i wear a 28, but i'm sure a fitted look would be more appealing to most. that said, i often get larger because they're a tiny bit shorter than i like, so i wear them kinda low. and if i",5
Love this color! when i saw this beautiful blue color in the store i had to try them on! so pretty! if you love pilcro chinos--you will be happy with these! same great fit and an awesome color!,5
"So cute and comfy. great fit. i bought them in green and they look great with wedges, sneakers or sandals. dress up or down. pair with a t-shirt and cotton blazer--adorable!",5
"I bought the yellow pair on vacation last week and loved them! i wore them home on the plane and had a pony tail holder in my pocket (basic goody binder), and there is a circle stain where the binder was! so strange! i sprayed them with spray and wash and washed them. the stain is still there and now it is discolored in the area i treated them! they are ruined! i am so disappointed and i only got one wear out of them!",1
"Similar to others here, these pants were ruined after one wash. the first pair i bought simply faded after one wash, which was okay, but the second pair got weird splotches on the backside. i'd rather not call attention to that particular area of my body;) could've been a great addition to my wardrobe if they were better quality.",1
"This material is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. i have two other dolan dresses made of the same material. i do wash mine - cold water, delicate cycle. i hang dry it. i am broad shouldered and heavy chested, and the cut of this dress is extremely flattering. you can dress it up or dress it down too, love that!",5
"Love these chinos! they are so soft, have the right amount of stretch for a curvy figure, and the colors are great. i have purchased the khaki and blue so far. the blue color has the perfect washed/faded look. i love that they have petite sizes available. i will be stocking up on the other colors.",5
I loved these pants. they fit perfectly. and then i washed them. like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them. the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns. so sad.  wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right?,1
"I loved the moss so much, had to go back to get the gold. these chinos look wonderful on. they can be dressed up with pumps and a blouse as well as dressed down with sneakers and a t-shirt. very versatile.",5
Pilcro pants are always a positive purchase. quality fabric. great design. i purchased the pink for spring and whenever. prettier in person than on line. they are a peachy pink color. will go with anything. dress them up or down.,5
"Love these pants. got them in yellow- gold color. pair them with retailer anafa tiered top which also has some yellow tones to it. goes lovely. good quality. important for me - the color is soft, not overly bright yellow, fabric is soft as well. great fit.!",5
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38-32-40 and the size 30s fit me perfectly.

2. the hyphen chino is my favorite pant. just stretchy enough. just casual enough without being sloppy. just nice enough to wear to work.

3. i bought both pinks and the moss. the turquoise were too big in the waist for some reason, but the color, while gorgeous, didn't work with the rest of my wardrobe.",5
"I've ordered a pair of these from the catalog and loved them. on my next visit to a store, i picked up another color. i'm now considering getting another pair while the free shipping deal is going on. they are great pants with a great fit.",5
"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and purchased this in the size xl. it fits very nicely; not tight. i usually have problems with peplum blouses hitting me oddly since i have a short waist, but this fit beautifully. i like the feel of the high quality fabric. the color green works so well with my red hair. i highly recommend this blouse.",5
"These pants are great! the color is beautiful & the fabric super soft. fit is slimmer than expected, but sill nice.",5
"I love these pilcro pants. i had them in two colors, both beige and khaki. super comfy, and they stretch out a little around the waist with wearing. however, i recently ruined both sets in the wash because i used a stain-stick remover to try to get some grease spots out of them. the stain stick instead lifted the dye off of them! now i have two sets of pants with odd light splotches on them...so sad they aren't more color-fast :(",5
"I own quite a few deletta tops, and this one nails it. a great staple in a pretty color (i purchased the green). peplum tops can be hit or miss for me and often come up short or balloon out too much. this one is so flattering. i initially ordered a medium (5'8"", 145) but exchanged for a small when i found the medium to be a little roomy on me. the small is perfect. the top is made of a medium weight material and is slightly fitted, nipping in at the waist. the ""skirt"" piece falls nicely and is l",5
My favorite pants! they do run slightly large so i sized down. i have 3 colors and will continue to add more!,5
I originally got this for myself but it was just a little bit more snug than i liked. i ended up giving it to my daughter. it fits her nicely and she wore it to her holiday party at work and it was a hit!!,5
"I've been looking at these online for a while now, and couldn't decide if they'd fit me or not. i have large, muscular thighs and pants always run tight. when i was in the store today i decided to try them on anyway, and boy am i glad i did. the fabric is super soft, as everyone else mentions, and they are nice and loose, but also look like ankle pants. i actually sized down! (who doesn't love it when they get to do that?!) i loved the way they fit so much, i bought two pairs. i love the pastel",5
"Dolan is my go to for comfy, pretty, practical dresses. i'm 5'0 125 lbs and i consistently wear a petite small in this brand. i bought the taupe - not my favorite color, but i had too many lbds and the green was not a summer color. i chose taupe to wear with my bronze and turquoise jewelry. summer must have.",5
"This top is an easy, classy staple for summer -tts and drapes well, great shape",5
"Beautiful dress, skims the body perfectly and flatters. the silky and breathable fabric is everything-- it's made of cupro (used as a silk substitute but breathes like cotton-- uniqlo uses it in their ""airism"" products which makes it perfect for summer weather!). i wore it to a summer barbecue, dressed down with a denim shirt tied at the waist and simple jewelry, but can easily dress it up with a chunky heeled sandal and statement jewelry. it's gorgeous-- get it!

These are my favorite pants. i love the fit and they are comfortable. i have them in several colors. i hope you never discontinue them!,5
"I am now on my third pair of these pilcro hyphen chinos...they fit my body type well, which is pear-shaped. they are super comfy, relaxed, and my go to pant. i love that they are a pop of color with what i am wearing vs just a normal jean. i can't say enough about these pants...",5
"I love the pilcro stet pants & want them in every color, every season! please retailer, never stop making these
pants. i also love the ""new addition to the family"": the pilcro capri pants & would love every color of these too!",5
These pants feel great. fit is true to size. the blue color is very unique. definitely recommend!,5
"I have these pants in a larger size, but recently lost some weight and wanted a smaller size.
they are so comfortable and soft and go with everything.
keep in mind that they run a little large and do stretch a bit once you wear them.
just wish they would be available in tall!!!",5
How i did not notice this dress for weeks i do not know. this is absolutely the best casual dress i've ever had the pleasure of owning and i hope my future includes acquiring the other sold out colors. i was fortunate enough to buy the holly in m and taupe in mp and they both fit well and look flattering on my unproportioned body. this dress goes well with many layers or on its own and is going to work for at least three seasons in my area. the drape of the willa complements my over large upper,5
"Pilcro has my heart! their cut and style are perfect for me - no more squeezing into skinny jeans! dear retailer, please always sell pilcro and maeve brands - they are amazing!",5
"I had to return the 2 for a size 4 and it is still snug in the ribs. i am very petite and usually wear size 0 and xs. the regular length hits me perfectly above the knee as i like. the previous review to order up was good but i'm writing to say i had to go up 2 sizes. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs, small frame.",5
"These pants are so comfortable and fit exactly as i expected. i love the variety of fun colors (i went with the gold). they are cooler than jeans, but just as versatile. i am 5'10"" and the length on me is the same as the model.",5
"This dress is stunning and very flattering. i am a few months postpartum with just a bit of belly flub left, and this skims in all the right places without showing that. the fabric is gorgeous, although it seems like the darker colors can be a little sheer (i got the holly). absolutely love this, would consider picking up another color. i do find it runs a little small compared to other dolan pieces, including those in this fabric. i have a tunic and another dress in a small. i got a medium here",5
"These are the most comfortable pants i have tried this season without sacrificing the style. they look best rolled up for that casual, chic look and can be dressed up or down. these do run slightly large. i'm 5""1 and 102- 104 pounds and took the 24 petite size. i bought the white color and will probably try another color or two before my size sells out. love these and really recommend them!",5
"Happy to have tried this one on in store. unlike other peplum, the bottom portion does not pop out. looks good under a cadi as well. find this top very versatile. i got both colors since they are both flattering.",5
"These feel well made and so soft, but for me, they were just too low and too baggy...all i did was pull them up and feel uncomfortable. i wanted them to work! maybe in a smaller size they would feel better. i ordered my normal 25, in the light pink. they were very cute, i think i just have a hard time with pants with a rise this low.",5
"I got the yellow ones and love them so much i ordered the stone color. very comfortable and i can wear in th office or on the weekend. thinking about ordering every color! i love the pilcro hyphen line. fits my 5'4"" frame and athletic build perfectly! i'm 135 lbs and wear a size 28.",5
"Great summer pants. real wide leg. fit perfect even my muscular thighs. run a little roomy right of the rack but stretch out terribly. in my regular size, they start falling off after few hours of wear. long. dragging on the floor on my 5'7 frame.",5
"Great, lightweight pants for summer!!! size down the length is slightly long and they stretch out throughout the day. i'm 5'8"" normally a 33 in pilcro and took a large in these. so cute",5
"I'm 5'2.5"" and petite and had originally ordered s but decide that it was a bit large for me so i returned it and ordered the xs and it fit like a glove with breathing space. i love the conservative style. i can easily move around in it when i'm in the water with my baby. i don't have a large chest but i imagine this would great for big busted girls. it's lightly padded around the bust area. the skirt detail is very cute and the print is unique. i've already gotten compliments on it.",5
"Super cute. 5'9"" 135 lbs and the medium was perfect to wear with a long sleeve shirt underneath. good quality and lined too. perfect for daytime when a leather moto might be a bit much.",5
"I bought these pants for a planned trip to southeast asia, where i want to look put together but also be very comfortable. the lightweight fabric is perfect for traveling in warm climates where one shouldn't necessarily be wearing shorts in certain public places or when visiting religious sites. these pants can also go to the pool, out on errands and to brunch. i bought the navy and would considering also buying the beige. great find and very reasonable sale price!",5
"This is the perfect sweater for early spring; lightweight; but not too thin. i""m 5'2"", 125 lbs. the medium fits perfect.",5
"I ordered this only because it was in the stylist's picks, and decided to see what it was about. i ordered a petite, and don't regret it. the petite on my 5'1.5"" falls right by te hips, which is more flattering for a bomber-style top #not sure if descriptions says that, but it is a bit bomber-style#. the color is truly ivory, not as white as hte picture depicts, though now that i look colsely, you do see a contrast with the white top the model is wearing #so don't expect very white#. as mentione",5
"This is such a pretty top and a great multi-season piece. i love the colors and pattern, and the cut is flattering. it's not too low cut in the front which is nice. it is woven on the front/sleeves and knit in the back so i'm a little nervous about how it will wash. i usually wear a m in retailer tops and a l in tiny (they usually are truly tiny) but in this tiny a m was good.",5
"This sweater is much more brilliant in person. the photo online doesn't do it justice. a couple of things, the faux fur collar is removable and it is attached with buttons of the same color as the sweater. the color is also more buttery than it appears. it hits right at the hip, which is so nice for wearing with dresses or skinny jeans and boots for a night out. i am 5'3"", 108 pounds and the xs hit me at hipline and was roomy without being oversized. it's really fun and festive with the collar,",5
"Pants are professional, super comfortable and color matches loads of tops. love them.",5
"I love wide-leg linen pants and i'm always in the market for them. i've purchased these in two colors and have been happy with them so far. the waistband is fold-over and snug. not too tight or too loose. the length is longer than advertised. i'm 5'10"" and typically take a 33.5 or 34"" inseam. these are long enough for me so they have to be a 33"" at least. others may complain, but i'm happy!",5
"This was my first choice as one piece suit after having 2 babies, the minute i put it on i just loved how confortable it felt and very flattering in all the right places. the fabric is great. i'm 5'4 and 155 lb i ordered a 10 and it fits great.",5
"I am 6ft tall and wear a size 12 bottom. i ordered these in a large because i wanted the length to be as long as possible and they were perfect.   i have a 36 in inseam and these pants drug on the floor.   i could even wear my wedges with them and they were still beautifully long and drapey.  i bought the silver color and it was definitely more of a khaki.  i probably could have easily worn a medium, as i did have to pull them up when i walked throughout the day.  this may be because of the stre",5
"I tried this on in the store and loved it. it runs large. i'm 5'7"", 130lbs, very short waisted, and i got the xs. i realized it had a sheer section on the side, but the store paired it with a beautiful scarf that helped cover the sheerness. i didn't feel i needed a cami while wearing the scarf. plus the scarf will keep me warmer and let me wear the shirt a little longer in the fall.",5
"I have purchased a lot from retailer but lately, some of the items have been disappointing in quality.verses cost, this being one. the picture is nice but the actual blouse is nothing like this. the size was not accurate so buy a size bigger because of the sleeves.",1
"My only con would be these are long...even in petite they are long. otherwise i have no complaints. i love the comfortable fold over waist band! ah. i am planning to wear these on a long flight...they will help me look put together and keep my legs warm (i always freeze on airplanes) plus they will feel good! i am 5'4"" and must wear more than a flat sandal...i tried on with a wedge and it worked well. not sure if i will hem or not. might wait till after washing. lovely. ordered my typical pxs (d",5
"Bought these in both moss and navy. fits perfect, love the style and the roll,down waist. excellent quality.
bought the peachy color top,with the elephants to wear with the moss colored one and received lots of compliments.",5
"This is a great jacket. my only issue is sleeves are way to long and had to have them shortened. this upped my price by 45.00. oh well, its still what i wanted!",5
"The picture makes the pants appear flattering and comfortable. but they are not flattering at all. they seemed much bigger than they should have been and the ""fold over"" portion was not necessary.",1
"Love this zip cardigan with removable faux fur. it did not look like much on the hanger but once on it is soft , rich and just adorable, it can be dressed up or down, perfect for a finishing piece over a dress to wearing with jeans and skirts. the fabric is soft but substantial . the only negative for me is the zipper sticks a little. a plus it is a ivory shade and is a good basic. i chose my typical medium and fits perfect . 34 dd chest for reference. sale price plus promo made this a winner. i",5
"Love these pants! i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. could even wear a little heel. the fold over waist is so comfy, they feel like pajamas but look very classy. i bought the navy and silver (more of a khaki color) on sale for a great deal. the washing instructions say line dry but i threw them in the dryer on low and they came out fine. just need to remove and hang quickly for less wrinkles.",5
"First, i must agree with the other reviewers who said that this jacket is short, because, well, it is. that being said, it is a perfect length for someone who is petite, like me. i am not a fan of lengthy tops or jackets, which tend to make my short body look like a blob. i love the length (or shortness) of this jacket! aside from that it fits true to size, is wonderfully warm and cozy, and makes me feel fabulous when i'm wearing it. it is my new favorite jacket!! :)",5
Really beautiful pants but run a very large-i usually wear four and am 5 10-the media was way too big in the waste and elsewhere and very long.,5
"I completely agree with the other reviewer. this sweater is so much prettier in person. i've been looking for years for a tasteful fur sweater and i think i finally found it. the size large was true to size for me aside from the very long sleeves, but i also have short arms. the fur isn't overwhelming and i love the pockets. i usually find sweaters with wool itchy but this one is not (it's 26% wool). i do plan to wear a cami or tank underneath.",5
I love this shirt. it is so soft. not boxy at all. very flattering. my only complaint is that there aren't more colors!,5
I really love this sweater. beautiful color and nice texture. i can't wait to wear it.,5
"Most beautiful dress i have ever seen or tried on. i read all of the reviews and it seemed ladies with hips stated the dress ran small. so, after over a year of watching this dress and waiting for it to go on sale, i order a size bigger than i normally wear. i was devastated that it was too large. all sizes except 0 and 00 were sold out, so now i am stuck returning my dress or paying a small fortune to have it altered.",5
Superb quality and design. i am a 34d and 120lbs. i am a size 6 to 8 but mostly 8 due to my hips and top. i am pear shaped and 5'6. the dress was a little loose but i just need to get it a little fitted but you can hardly tell. i love the floral patterned so intricate. it truly looks like a princess dress. it is little heavy and at least it's not too tight for dancing.,5
"I recently bought this dress in an retailer store, to attend an art museum event,. the open back created an awkward bra exposure problem, which i solved by buying a gabardia camisole by lacausa (the same brand and print as the dress.) the dress is described as casual, but it can be dressed up with gold shoes or sandals. 
the retailer saleswoman brought me the dara vegan leather jacket in plum, by hei hei to complete the outfit. the contrast between the airy dress and the vegan leather was chic and",5
"I am obsessed with this dress. i wore it on new year's eve. i felt stunning in it. i can't wait to wear it again as soon as possible.
very good quality. my regular size 6 fit me but i cannot gain not even a pound more :) i'm 5""7' 144lb. i'm between slender and curvy.",5
"I just received my dress yesterday and it is gorgeous!!! i actually ordered 2 sizes, 00p and 0p, depending on some cuts i'm between those 2 sizes, i am 5'1 92 lbs but with holidays eating i have gained 4 pounds so far, so the 00p was bit too tight all way from hips to bust area, i was able to zip it up but was a bit painful to keep breathing and got some weird wrinkles on the back between waist line and derriã©re.
the dress is a beautiful cocktail of sexy curvy silhouette with the baroque flavor",5
"I love these jeans. i bought my normal size 28 but after just two hours of wearing them, they had stretched out so much that i could take them off without un-buttoning them! (i probably could have gone two sizes smaller but i wanted them to fit loose). my local store was willing to offer me an exchange. kudos to retailer's wonderful customer service and standing by their products! i actually wear mine un-cuffed with boots and it looks super cute.",5
"For me, this top ran true to size. i'm so glad i ordered it in my normal size, because the spandex would have made the top way too clingy for me. i am normally a 8/medium on top and 12 bottom. i ordered this in a medium, and do not find it large at all. if you are going for a fitted look, sizing down may be best, but i didn't want it tight. on me, it's a little looser than what is shown on the model, but it still fits very nice, and not sloppy. i am not a fan of baggy tops. i have no issues with",5
"This dress is stunning. the combinations of patterns/fabrics is beautiful and the cut is very flattering. i tend to wear a 6 or 8 depending on brand and the 8 fits perfectly. i am 32c on top and more of an apple than a pear shape, so the straight lines hide the tummy but shape the hips. love love love. i can't wait to wear this.",5
The dress is a great buy especially since it was on sale. it fits like his other dresses flattering as i don't have a big bust and have a bit of extra skin from pregnancies but with this dress i feel amazing. get a ton of compliments when i wear it!,5
"This dress stunning for the hourglass figure. the hips may be a little narrow. i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best. i read some reviews that said the hips were snug. it's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering. shoulders are a little loose, and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest. i'm 5'4, 32dd, waist 27 and 130 lbs.",5
"Size 2p is perfect for me (32a, 25"" waist, and 32"" hip) with a lot of room left for a big dinner. the design is exceptionally creative and attractive, and the fabric is of very high quality.",5
"This dress is gorgeous and perfect for holidays. unlike other byron lars dresses that have some stretch to them, this dress is fitted and has no give. i typically wear a size 4 (135lbs, 5'8, 34c) but in chest the 4 was too tight, i could zip it but could not breathe lol.. i sized up to 6 and the fit is true perfection.",5
"This is a richly detailed top that i bought to go with some nice skirts. the length hits right at the waist so it won't overlap a special skirt at the waist and create extra bulk. it is lined with a flesh colored mesh layer in the white color (you can see this layer in the photos but i wasn't sure if it was part of the piece or a camisole the model was wearing). however, it is still somewhat transparent so you would want to wear it with a flesh-colored bra or cami. overall, i am very happy with",5
"This is a gorgeous dress. it comes with a black silky belt, but mine was too large, which is probably why it is not shown on the model photos. i think maybe it only works if you're on the larger size for the dress. it's very easy to get on and off due to the front zipper. i was worried about bra straps showing on the low cut back, but they actually show more at the broad shoulders. i'm not sure if that's more apparent because i went up on the size to have room at the hips. there is a cute kick p",5
"This is an amazing dress. beautiful fabric and color. comfortable too. it's like wearing air. sorta chameleon like because this print  literally goes with anything and looks unforgettable on. it's slimming too. i got the large and it flows so nicely over my body. the back is completely open. it closes with a tie at the neck and the waist that drapes beautifully and looks great from the side view. the fabric is a bit sheer so i ordered the white cotton slip by this designer, which is slightly snu",5
"I?m not the type of woman that wears dresses, but oh man...this dress! i?ve been eyeing it for a while, and it finally went on sale, then the extra 30% off made me cave. got it for $115. i bought it one size smaller (8) to encourage me to not over-indulge this xmas, and if fit like a glove. for reference, i?m 36 bust, 30 waist and normally a size 10 in retailer. it accentuates your curves & hugs your body while being ""sexy/conservative"". the intricate embroidery is exquisite and very eye catching.",5
"Measurements: 30aa / 24"" waist 5'4""

i historically wear 00p in jcrew and most retailer brands. i purchased a 0p and it fit well with a little room. i really hated that the waistline is almost a drop-waist. the ivory brocade panel comes low on the navel, so it makes you look shorter than you really are.

the most impressive part of this dress is the neckline/shoulder. i have pretty narrow shoulders, so it's a quasi-boatneck and it's quite lovely.",5
"This dress truly is a work of art and i am becoming a little obsessed with byron lars' clothing line. this is my 3rd dress by him and i have been a size 2 in the other dresses. the 2 does fit in this dress but it is a little snug. not sure if a 4 would look as good because it is meant to be form fitting. the panels trick the eye into making you look thinner too. my dimensions 32c,26,33. it fits perfectly in the hips and waist but is tight on top.",5
"When this arrived in the mail, i knew there was a 50/50 chance of a sheath dress working with my body-type (athletic on top, larger on bottom). i usually wear size 6 in a-line dresses, and i found this dress, size 6, in the sale room, and barely squeezed in. ordered size 10 and love it. (for ref, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34-b) the belt is adjustable, which puts everything in place. the front collar blends seamlessly into the sleeves, and the brocade panels are such a great quality of material, reminding m",5

"I found this dress on sale recently in store and it was in my size- a 2p! i tried it on and it fits perfectly for my 34 d and 5ft frame. since i found it in store and it is an older dress, there are some frays in the threading (probably from being shipped, handled, etc). i still bought it for the sale price. i look forward to wearing it out!",5

"I tried these jeans on in my regular size and they seemed way too big, but still kinda cute. i went one size down and suddenly they were the most adorable, comfortable jeans that i've every had (and i have a lot of jeans!). i love them! they are very soft with gorgeous fading around the pockets. they are button fly which is unique. i got them on the sale on sale price and they are well worth every bit and more. i plan on wearing them with boots although high heal shoes should be beautiful with t",5
"I am in lust with this fabulous dress. it's a feast for the eyes. it's so busy and detailed, yet it all works. fit on me is perfect. i did not have to size down or up. my upper torso is larger (m/l) than my bottom half (m/s). i also have a square waist. this dress makes me look like i have an hourglass figure. i love it as much as the mona dress. another point goes to ease of putting it on. i own six byron lars dresses and this is the *easiest* one to put on! just zip up and go.",5
"I fell in love with this dress two years after it sold out so i'm so lucky to have gotten my greedy little hands on this eye catching retro modern number. my mom adores the fit on me as it reminds her of her youth in the 50's and 60's. i originally sized down to a 6, not realizing my bust/wide rib cage would make the fit difficult. wish i could have found an 8 but settled for 10p and will have a tailor finish it. i'm also going to remove the tulle layer since i want to wear as more casual frock.",5
"I love everything about this dress. the patterns are gorgeous and the mixture of fabrics and textures are so unique that they make such a beautiful statement. i got this in a 0p after reading review, and am usually a 00p-0p. the dress fit a bit baggy on me but if i can find some way to tighten the belt it would definitely still be wearable. i agree with other reviews that the top is larger. my measurements are 31-24-34...and i felt like the bottom fit comfortably with some room but the waist and",5
"I am a shopper....i shop a lot. this is one of my favorite dresses of all time! so unique, and, as others have said, like a piece of art! the fit is tight through the middle but that's what makes it look so perfect. i wore with tall brown suede boots and got compliments from ken and women alike. i love it!",5
"This dress!!!! i had to try it on. of course i fell in love with it. it is so gorgeous in person, like a piece of unique artwork. you'll never find a dress like this!",5

"It is my favorite piece in my closet right now. it is cute. it feels like a pillow. i just want to sleep in it, but i also want to wear it out so that i can show it off.",5
This is a perfect sweater to dress up or dress down. very comfortable and stylish. i love the slits on the side. works great with skinny jeans or leggings.,5
"This is a beautiful quality knit. i do wish that it was a tad bit longer...i'm 5'7"" with a long torso and found it to hit like the model shot. since the sweater flares a little at the bottom, i think it might be more flattering a little longer. keeping this regardless because it will still get plenty of wear.",5
Love the top! this is an attractive black top with a unique back which will match pretty much any thing in ones closet! yes i would say it runs a size bigger however it does not take away from the quality nor design,5
I saw a lady trying this on in the store and fell in love with sweater. picture does not do it justice! there is so much detail. my usual size is small and it fit perfect. well worth price.,5
"Ladies don't let this beauty get away. never paid much attention to it on-line but went into local retailer today and it was returned by someone. i couldn't get it on fast enough. it is gorgeous. runs tts. i took the small, for reference i am 36c top and petite. this will work on any body type. you won't be sorry. well worth the money for the style and fabric.",5
I bought this sweater to freshen up my fall wardrobe and just love it! adds texture and warmth to every outfit.,5
"Per baily 44's usual, no visible lines, hits in all the right places, extremely flattering, washes well, all of it. fo this price especially you'd be fool to pass this little number up!",5
"Definitely a curve hugger. i bought the summer version of this dress (sleeveless white with black stripes) earlier this year and it was my go to dress all season long. was very excited to see a fall/winter version to pair with tights and boots. bought a medium again and it fits great. this is a very flattering dress, and the material is lightweight yet substantial and forgiving of flaws.",5
"I love this sweater - i've gotten compliments on it every time i've worn it! i have the moth color and it is oh so cozy, yet not too big or too heavy. i pair it with black leggings, black booties and a crimson-colored scarf. it's nice as it can be great for day-to-evening. getting the other two colors asap! the medium fits me perfectly.",5
"This is the most beautiful and flattering skirt. it was a bit of an investment piece for me in that i just graduated from college, but i love that this skirt can be worn year round. it is more fitted at the top and then flows out at the bottom, making it super flattering. pictures do not do it justice!",5
"I purchased this in the cream/beige color and love that it will go with everything. i can add details with long necklace or scarf-even a belt but it also stands alone and looks great with leggings or skinny jeans. i would also wear with a neutral skirt as shown on model. the fabric is not too thin and with a bit of cashmere will also add some warmth. it may shed some depending if you wear a nylon cami underneath. i purchased the xs, my usual size and fits great. 5'8-slender. love my purchase!",5
Loved the flared style of this cardigan. i first choose the yellow and returned it for the navy. the knit pointelle design is interesting and the cardi is so soft. have used it many times already - always makes me feel great.,5
I love this sweater. looks great with leggings or high waisted jeans. like most maeve clothing it runs a little large so i would size down. i get several compliments every time i wear this one. super comfortable too!,5
"I bought this in navy, medium, after looking at it online and reading all of the reviews. i am so glad i did. it hangs beautifully, and i have worn it nearly every day since it arrived. i am 5'3"", and 34 dd on top, with narrow shoulders and a short torso, so not easy to fit. this is very well made, and a medium to heavy cotton perfect for spring and foggy evenings in california. in fact i am wearing my new sweater over my friday casual tee at work today. if you ware hesitating the purchase at co",5
"I have this sweater in ivory and raspberry. it's gorgeous. holds up well on had wash cycle also. it's so flattering. i'm so so happy i bought theses. i am 5'8"", athletic build and a normal medium, this runs large. i bough smalls.",5
"I agree with the first reviewer exactly. beautiful fabric and ""idea"" of dress (looks stunning on model), but huge and shapeless in person like a tent. not at all what i expected when ordering a 2 petite. sadly, has to be returned.",1
This sweater in the yellow caught my eye several times and i finally tried it on! so cute and perfect for transitional weather. threw it over the striped top that was hanging in the changing room. ended up with both!,5
"I found this cardigan/sweater in the sale room at retailer in navy. thought i would just try it on. the picture does not do this justice. it is a basic piece but it is so soft and comfortable and when on, it has a little bit of a whimsical swing to it. i loved the way it kind of came to life. i wear a m/l and bought the m. i have a 36d bust and it looked great. it is a nice weight for spring/fall. it is not a heavy sweater.",5
"I love, love, love this brand. these people know how to cut and construct a dress. i'm apple-shaped and have trouble finding fitted dresses that flatter me, but this one makes me look curvy and hides my flaws. the pattern lays perfectly and will make you look great. the fabric is high-quality and fully-lined. it's perfect for work or for going out. i love that it's black and bronze-y, because i can wear it with black or brown accessories. i'm generally between a l/xl in retailer and the l fits wel",5
"I was really disappointed in the shirt. the blue embroidery is a lot darker than what is shown in the photo, and barely stands out against the black. the photo does not accurately depict this shirt. i will be returning.",1
"I love this tunic. the knit is soft and comfortable and very easy to wear. i purchased ""moss"" and can change the look of the outfit by adding various accessories. the slits on the side are cut rather high and i have found that jeans or leggings of a thicker fabric look best.",5
"I wish i could wear this sweater every day! it is extremely soft. runs large. 5'9"", 130lbs, bought a large and it was way too big, but i successfully shrunk it in the dryer. sleeves are too bulky. it's not perfection, especially the sleeves. the photo shows the models with the sleeves pushed up. there is no way you could do that. they are almost like bell sleeves, and the material stretches like crazy. wish i had ordered down, but still love it.",5
"This is an extremely flattering dress. i couldn't resist buying it, even though i didn't come into the store looking for a dressier dress, which i feel this is. once i tried it on, i had to purchase it. its one of those things that i know i won't regret because at some point, an occasion will show up that i'll wear it to. its soft, comfy and flowing and accentuates the body's curves without being too tight or clingy. its a classic!",1
Perfect spring transition piece-- saffron yellow but medium weight and breathable. this color is in for spring and the perfect blend for a not too warm cover up!,5
I'm so sad this doesn't come in a petite length because the dress is extremely long! the fabric and design is beautiful although i do wish the fabric was a bit more flowly.,5
This sweater is so soft and comfortable. looks dressy with skirt and booties or casual with leggings and flats.,5
This sweater caught my eye while in the store shopping for a gift. i am on the shorter size so i was worried that it would drown me. it didn't! it hits me mid thigh. the sides are cut up high. i will wear a cami or shirt under it. super soft material. flattering fit. i have put on a little weight and this hides all the problem areas without looking frumpy. thanks,5
"I'm 5,4"", 135 lbs. i got the petite xs (normally would be petite small) and love the fit. it's soft weave and the length exudes the feeling of comfort and warmth.",5
"Really cute and comfortable. i can wear it to work for a casual friday, or out on the weekend. a lot of the sequins are falling off and getting stuck in my dryer!",5
I wear this vest a lot for it is really cozy and goes with a lot of different types of outfits! it's is versatile and figure flattering. i only buy timeless pieces that i know won't go out of style and this vest fits the bill!,5
"A lovely sweatshirt with mesh front and back cover with soucotache (sp?) handwork, with a touch of sequins for some pop! the knit sleeves are thin, but the top has some weight due to the detailing on the front and back.

the fit is tts and as shown on the model. it lays comfortable but it's not really baggy.

really lovely. glad i bought one before it was sold out.",5
"I purchased the raspberry color and it is beautiful. even though the sweater is very long and covers your bottom, it is surprisingly flattering. great with the booties or boots and skinny jeans. i am 34, 30, 37 and purchased a size small which, fits perfectly.",5
"Bought this dress based on the other reviews and was glad i did. fabric is very nice and soft. it drapes nicely, hiding my tummy trouble area. very flattering and not too short, i could wear it with a blazer to work and also out on a date night. happy with my purchase.",5
I love this top! i typically wear a size small and this is very true to size. it's loose fitting but does not make you look large. the pattern on the material is also fun without being too busy. perfect for fall!,5
"This is a beautiful, artistic piece for your wardrobe! seriously, rosie neira is a talented, london-based designer, who will thrill you with her vision. she is expert at making a woman look amazing from every direction; these knits are stunning, the materials and workmanship flawless. the medium fits me as expected (size 8, medium top, 34f). i was drawn to this by the rosie neira label, the flowing front drape and slightly longer back, the gorgeous knit quality and design, and the way it makes m",5
This dress fits pretty much how it looks on the model. the fabric is soft and the stripes are a goldish color. i bought this because of the other reviews and glad i did! perfect dress for work and going out. the petite hits me mid-thigh like in the photo.,5
"I absolutely adore this cardigan. it's very feminine, stylish, and comfortable and the gold color is gorgeous. i received numerous compliments when i wore it to work the first time. it's the perfect weight for transitional weather or chilly offices.",5
"I just received this shirt in the mail, and i'm in love. it isn't your average t-shirt in that it has character and class. i can't wait to wear it! another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back wasn't as dramatic as the picture; i'm not seeing it. i think the blue stands out very well. i know i should say, ""hurry and get yours before they're gone,"" but in truth, i'd rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt! :)",5
"This has such a beautiful shape, goes with so many things and has gotten a lot of compliments already. my favorite new piece.",5
I went into the store to look at a few certain items. this wasn't one of them but it really caught my eye. i got it in yellow. it is such a great sweater. tts,5
"I love retailer sweaters! always great quality and design, this one is no exception. i have the navy blue one and it fits well, true to size.",5
"Just what i was looking for. soft, cozy and warm.",5
"After reading all the reviews and sizing down one size. i got my top size m, i usually wear m/l depending on the style. i'm 6 ft tall, 160 lb, i like my clothing loose but not as loose as this top. i should have gone to xxxxxs if such exists. no wonder there is such a low leap in price. it is a good quality though, and very nice pale peach color. no would not recommend, unless you wear 3xxxl",1
"I love this robe, it is my new favorite for lounging around the house",5
"I purchased the blue, and i love the style and fit of the shirt. i worry a bit about the slit showing too much cleavage in certain positions, but my friends have assured me that it is work appropriate. very flattering, and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it.",5
I am loving these. they are quite long but are prefect to wear with pj shorts or leggings. very soft and cozy.,5
"I am not a fan of unlined bras, but this one was so pretty i had to try it. the lace doesn't look cheap, but overall i wouldn't have wanted to pay full price. it fits well and the support offers a nice shape (no cone!). i might go back for the other color.",5
These leg warmers are perfect for me. they are long enough and thick and warm enough to keep me from freezing in cold weather. great for people with large calves.,5
"This robe is one of the best purchases i have made in the past year. i would also add that it is much cuter in person than pictured on the model. usually things look better on the models, but not this one. i have a tough time finding robes and sleepwear in petite sizes (thank you, retailer!). this robe is sooooo soft and cuddly, without being too heavy. the teal color is so pretty and the hemstitch detail is nice. i hate taking this off in the morning to get dressed.",5
"This is the mid-weight fall/spring jacket i had designed for myself in my head! someone got into my head and made it! really - i could not have dreamed up a lovelier jacket. it fits like a glove, it's absolutely the softest thing ever, and the (removable) lining is far warmer and plusher than i expected (i wore it out tonight on a a clear, cold night - i felt like i was wearing a hug). nice, feminine waistline and pockets in all the right places round it all out. i look forward to unbuttoning th",5
"I knew once i saw this online that i would love it, because of that i almost feel like my review is biased. i have been searching for a jacket like this for awhile. i own the holding horses version from a few years back, but that one is just not fitted enough in the waist for me (even though it has a drawstring waist). this one too has an interior drawstring waist and it is more fitted in the waist giving the feminine appearance i desire. but it's not too tight. i am small up top, 34b but larger",5
"I got these in the brown and the red in my usual xspetite, and love both. the length is perfect for my 5'3"" height and they're not skin tight, but fit like a glove (i have a 26"" waist and 34"" hips). the elastic inside the waistband can get flipped fairly easily if i'm not careful, but it's easy to flip it back. i think that's the only thing that might stop me from attempting to wash them in the machine against the instructions, which say to hand wash only. i wish they had been made machine washa",5
"I picked these off of the rack at retailer, mainly because i loved the navy, black and brown combo of the squares. i tried on the medium, because they looked on the small side, even though i usually wear a size 4, or small in pants. good thing too, these fit really well,so they do run small, albeit a bit long in the regular medium on my 5'3"" frame. i could have used a petite for length if they had been there, but they didn't. that's ok, i don't mind rolling them up, it makes a statement i like. ye",5
"Love the subtle print - makes these good for work and for play. will wear with wedge booties, flowing top and jacket. perfect outfit.",5
"This skirt is gorgeous. i'm glad i saw it in-store as the picture online does not do it justice. the colors are really rich and the pattern has a sentimental, vintage feeling. it also has pockets and a great, glamorous swing to it. this skirt is great for work with a blouse and heels and also looks awesome with a t-shirt tucked in and sandals. the fabric has a really nice four season weight, i think it will also look great with high boots and a turtleneck in the autumn. i get so many compliments",5
"Retailer is my favorite store!  they always have everything i want and more.  these pants are absolutely beautiful and intricate in design and the quality is fantastic.  it's stylish and a pair of pants that i will always use and that will last for anlobn time. and how can i forget, these pants are slimming",5
"I ordered the black and red check leggings thanks to the suggestion of the retailer stylists online. there is no way in a million years that i would have picked these out due to my body shape. i'm petite size 6 and 120 pounds and 5 feet tall. i ordered a petite small. i do not have skinny legs and ordered these anyway. they are so flattering that i'm thinking of ordering the grey pair. the red pair are kind of darker. the picture makes the red look so much bright than they really are. trust me, yo",5
"This looked beautiful online, but the skirt isn't 100% silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels, with most of them containing some level of polyester. parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch, and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap. overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online.

a definite return. i wouldn't even recommend this at first or second cut.",1
"I got the size wrong, and the right size was ot available - so sad! i really loved this.",5
"This is such a cute vest. nice and cozy. so cute paired with a long sleeve tee, statement necklace, jeans and booties. very happy with my purchase!",5
"I wore this unbuttoned with a moss green tla tank top, faded, ripped, rolled up stevies with gladiator sandals and turquoise jewelry and it looked great. this is an amazing piece for your summer wardrobe that can be worn so many ways.",5
These are my favourite sleep pants. the waist band shrinks with every wash even without drying all the way on low. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large so the waist band didn't cut in my sides.,5
This sweater is so cute and classic and i've gotten so many compliments it's so gorgeous the wool is sooo warm 10/10 recommend,5
"This one is perfect for the taller ladies (or those looking for a longer fit). i was a little discouraged by a few short-fitting tops recently, and this one finally works for me (at 5'7"" with a long torso). awesome quality, not overly delicate, and beautiful detail.",5
Perfect lace tank. i am six feet tall and this top hits me about where it does on the model. i ordered xl and feel it is a generous tts . it is very figure flattering and not too tight across the bust. it has a thin lining so no camisole is needed. so beautiful!,5
"This top arrived by mail this morning, it is beautiful even prettier than the picture. fits true to size and is wonderful quality. cannot wait to wear it when i leave on vacation this weekend.",5
"Love it, super cute, super comfortable. watch those bra straps!",5
The fabric of this looks and feels so cheap it's hard to believe this is anna sui. i would say this is unwearable. there is zero stretch and it is made of itchy textured poly fabric that looks like novelty fabric at best. going back asap.,1
"I am petite and so ordered this top in a petite size and found that it ran large. i am also pretty busty to boot, but found there was more than enough room. the length was still a bit long for me, however it does hit on my where it does on the model. the top is wonderful quality, thick and not see through at all. i am almost tempted to get a regular size and try to wear it as a dress.",5
"I love this tee! while it is true to size i feel, it is meant to have a loose fit. that being said, it is a very flattering cut and has a great drape. super comfy, flattering and classic.",5
"I love this sweater. as others have mentioned, it's not the softest acrylic in the world, but i can overlook that for the simple fact that it's adorable. i like the cropped fit- pairs perfectly with high waisted jeans/skirts. the embroidery has a sort of handmade feel to it without looking cheap. the slit up only one side makes it unique in my opinion. i did expect it to be a bit heavier, but it's a great layering piece and ideal for transitioning into colder weather. i may be biased because of",5
"I'm 5'9 and 150 pounds and got a medium. the cut is very flattering on me and i have received many compliments when i wear it. it is lined, so no need to wear a cami underneath.",5
"I accidentally found this gem at my store today. i adore layering my style, and this is a perfect edition. it's light, but has enough weight to it that it has some movement and doesn't stick to other fabric. i wouldn't quite call it ""gauze"" since its heavier than your typical gauze. it's super long. i'm 5'8 and it definitely went to my knees. when worn buttoned up, it's clean and classic. when worn open, it's cool, bohemian and edgy...while still looking totally put together. i adore this. wish",5
Love this dress. perfect for spring and fall. great material and well made. lovey design. the dress has a built in slip.,5
I love the ease of wearing and styling this top. i am very pleased with the construction. glad i ordered it!,5
This top is so flowy and has a great fit! i can see wearing it lots of different ways. it could definitely be dressed up or dressed down.,5
"Another maeve maxi to add to my crowded closet! i adore the print, it reminds me of morocco. i went with my usual m based on reviews about the waistband. i will have to disagree as i should have chosen s instead. i'm not going to return it, but i think this will really stretch out because of the knit and weight of the jersey.",5
"I am kicking myself for listening to an earlier negative review and not ordering this dress months ago. i finally took a chance on clearance and i love it! the knit fabric is soft and beautiful! so is the design and construction. the fabric is very light and delicate. all the details on the dress are just top notch. the body of the dress is lined, but the sleeves are not - so there's a slight see-through effect on the sleeves, showing the lovely and delicate knit. it fits like a dream, and i've",5
"All t-la's are great. but this one style is my fave. very comfortable, chic, and washes well! i got the grey, but i'm back to get more colors!",5
Cute kitty sweater! i'm 5 feet 105 # and went with a regular size xs instead of petite and it hits perfectly!  yes it's itchy it wool! but i plan on wearing mine with a high/low tee under it. so cute!,5
"This dress is a beauty. i am 5'11"" and plan to wear this as a tunic over leggings or straight leg pants. the embroidery is really pretty, even though it does run a bit big. i would have liked a size 12 or less but it was completely sold out except for a size 14. it is so nice, with gorgeous high quality denim that i will make the best of it - may need to get some tailoring but in my mind, this dress is so worth it.",5
"I'm only 4'11"" and this top comes to the top of my knees. i could wear it as a mini-dress. lol! so, it is definitely a tunic for us shorter gals. now, it can be shortened. the underlayer can be cut and rehemmed shorter. then the over-lay lace has to be very gently snipped around the scallop pattern a few rows up. i'm debating whether i should do it or not. the bottom is simply a snipped off row from the fabric to create the scallop lace trim anyway.

as far as sizing, it's tailored. i didn't f",5
"As in previous reviews, this top can be worn in many ways. it could even be used as a pretty bathing suit cover-up. i like it with my cropped cotton spandex leggings which i have in many solid colors. i plan to wear it unbuttoned with my classic style spandex tanks i have in various colors & prints. the complete look says 'summer' & feels cool & comfy in this warm weather. even hubby loves the look! 5'3"", 117#. i bought my usual size small.",5
"My absolute favorite dress yet from retailer! i wore it to numerous events this past summer and felt like $1,000,000.! glad it's on sale now for others to snatch up.",5
"I purchased this about a month ago and its a great piece! it goes with just about everything from dresses to jeans and a long sleeve t-shirt. i love how it drapes around the front, and the material is very soft. it's a great piece for fall weather that will be a keeper in my closet!",5
"I love this sweater it's so cute and so soft, and warm!",5
"Love this dress so much! i bought the cranberry color first, and i loved it so much, that i also bought it in black. i think it runs fairly true to size. i am 5'3"" and about 110, and the xs petite fit perfectly. i tried the xs, and it was pretty large on my frame. i love the fabric and flow of this dress, and i love the pockets.",5
The material on this dress is gorgeous. so soft! the fit is flattering and casual and looks great with booties or high boots!,5
"I was a little afraid to order this dress online but my local store only had a small left, so i jumped hoping the fabled net would appear, and it did. this might be my favorite retailer dress thus far. i ended up buying a large due to the fear of the front being too short, it was a good call. i'm sure a medium would have fit up top but i have longer legs and i know i wouldn't have felt comfortable in a medium's length. plus i tend to like the oversized look. i paired it with some slouchy socks and",5
"Thick, soft, awesome quality - what's not to love?! i've had an awful time finding a new black warm cardigan this year to throw over anything from a tee to a casual dress, and this finally fits the bill! while it is soft like a sweatshirt, i would definitely not say that this is purely loungewear. nice enough to replace my old ratty sweaterknit!",5
"I love the elbow patches on this shirt. i ordered the wine color, and it's dark enough to almost be a neutral. i've worn it with many things already. my only complaint is that the sleeves are super long. typically, long sleeved shirts are too short for me, so i'm guessing this one would be ridiculously long on someone with short arms.",5
"An impulse try on that was immediately moved into the ""yes i'm buying right now"" pile. the tunic is so soft. i have worn as a shirt dress with booties and knee boots/knee socks. the fabric (while not the most forgiving if you buy this tight) is so soft and cozy. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, 34c, and the small hands nice and loose all around the body. when this goes on sale, i am buying more colors.",5
"This is absolutely gorgeous cardigan! the pictures don't do it justice! it's comfortable and soft and very trendy at the same time! i bought it in teal and in medium, i am 5'3"" and usually wear 10-12! even though i think it runs tts, but for more fitted look, medium fits better ! i am blond and this color looks great! i also loved it when unzipped the upper part, it looked even better! it is perfect with leggings in grey, blue, green and black, also beautiful with aqua flora leggings and with re",5
"I tried this on at the suggestion of one of the sales girls. i was skeptical of the simple shape, but when i put on the green one, i didn't want to take it off-ever. i am 6' and thin- the small fits me perfectly. i loved it so much, i purchased the blue as well. love, love, love!",5
I have this dress in red and black and i'm contemplating getting the green one. it's amazingly soft and falls beautifully. really flattering and i just had a baby 6 weeks ago! it's true to size. i'm 5'6 and 138lbs and got a small. it should still fit fine once the rest of the baby weight is gone.,5
"As a busty but small-waisted girl, i normally would not wear a loose shift like this. however, it turned out to be perfect for hiding my early/mid pregnancy belly. the dress is extremely comfortable, and it will also come in handy in the postpartum months. in fact, it looks so cute that i might just add it to my regular wardrobe after all.",5
"This dress is casual enough to throw on as a cover up and dressy enough for a night out. it so comfy and versatile. will never go out of style. it does run large, but that is just the style of the dress. it really is the perfect summer dress.",5
"I love the details of this top, from the pleating to the sleeves, the pommed edges and the black lace at the bottom. the material is soft and comfortable. the fit is flowy and the details are feminine yet simple. it's light weight which will be nice in warm weather. and let me say once more how much i love the sleeves.",5
This is very large.  i normally am a s/m and i took this in an x.  it is a beautiful dress in color and fit but picks up any stain and i have had to have it dry cleaned after every use.,1
This dress is amazing. i have it in almost every color. it is incredibly comfortable and versatile. you can dress it up or down. love it!,5
"This top has a nice quality feel to it with natural fibers and i love the pom poms. however, it does have a roomy fit, so you might want to size down. as a petite person, i have a tendency to get lost in very billowy styles. overall, comfortable and cute and a nice rich blue color.",5
"I purchased this sweater after i saw it on a salesclerk at my local retailer store. i am usually a xs but based on reviews decided to size up considering the description of the fit of arms. when it arrived it was overall ok but seemed boxy at sides so i exchanged for my usual size. it arrived today and fits great-less fabric along sides but still good length for my 5'8, slender frame. the arms and shoulders are not too snug. the colors are beautiful and it is out of the ordinary-a statement piece,",5
"So soft, warm, and comfy! the colors are absolutely beautiful and represented accurately in the photo. i went with a small based on other reviews, and while it fits, it is slightly big. i probably could have sized down for a more tailored look but i like the extra room and think it still drapes well without looking bulky. for reference i'm 5'7"" 115 lbs (33-25-33) and mostly wear an xs/2 in tops. it does shed which is not a big deal to me but might be a deal breaker for others so i thought i woul",5
I'm a little hesitant about the dropped-hem style but this drapes so well and looks utterly chic. i wore it to a poetry reading with some fluevogs and it not only looked good but it felt like i was wearing nothing. the material is beautifully soft and i love this particular shade of blue. will definitely be wearing this a lot.,5
"What more could you want than a dress that slips on easily, hugs all the right places and skims the others, feels like pajamas, and looks great for any occasion? i am about 120, 5'-1', 32 dd, usually a 4 petite. i ordered the petite small in navy and it fits just like the model photos. i tried it on in the store in a regular small and x-small, and could have gone with either, but the petite had better proportions, especially where the v-neck hit (i would have had to wear a very low plunge bra wi",5
"Saw this online and thought it would be perfect for my upcoming plane ride. originally ordered the teal color, but when it arrived, i was disappointed that it was more of a muddy greenish teal and not the light bluish teal like in the photo. exchanged it for the black version and i couldn't be happier. the black goes well with everything--looks great with jeans and yoga pants. love it!!",5
"I love this dress! i was apprehensive about it at first, because of the light material and boxy style. turns out the material is very flattering, and it hangs very well. the style isn't as boxy as it seems. it still flatters the figure without showing all your imperfections and it doesn't fit like a tent. i am 5'4"" and i ordered the petite. it's short enough to show off you legs, but not too short. for being less fitting, i like the balance of the short length, and it looks great with heeled boo",5
"This is great without a belt, with or without leggings. it drapes just right and is flattering for big busted, big behind women (like me).",5
"This is one of the best things i've ever purchased at retailer. it's comfortable, stylish, and flattering. i ordered it in black, and i'm now ordering the green as well. i usually wear small in the dolan line, and this is no exception. i am 5'2"", 135 lbs, athletic build, and the regular small fits perfectly.",5
"This top fits nicely, lays nicely, and washed nicely! i purchased the same shirt in other colors because it was such a great purchase! i am short and it was not too long and not clingy.",5
Very comfy and warm! i love this! i bought the xs even though i am usually a s or xs.,5
True to size and lovely colors. bought this for my granddaughter and she loved it.,5
"I am so happy i took a chance on this jumpsuit! i am post-baby (six weeks) and although i intend on slimming down more i would say that it is flattering even at my current size. and it will only get better! 
the quality and color are great!",5
"Super cute cardigan! can wear it with black tights and boots or shorts when it starts warming up. the color is great! i was hesitant about buying it but thankful i did. will probably buy it in the black, too.",5
"The material is soft (maybe not the best quality) and the cut is easy to wear. i have both colors and love them...they wash nicely and i like the ""baseball"" cut at the bottom. i especially like the print at the neck line...very cute and feminine.",5
"I purchased this for travel for a work meeting, i paired black slim pants under with heels-
i added a long simple necklace and it was perfection. after getting a little wrinkled in my suitcase, i simply hung up while i showered and the wrinkles fell right out.
it was comfortable, traveled well, was light, but looked very professional. you could wear tights under with boots or i can see in the spring with fun nude shoes.

"I've had my eye on this dress ever since i saw it in a fall catalog. my daughter's name is tegan and this is exactly the style i love - simple. when it went on sale i was lucky enough to find it in the green color i wanted at a great price. it is so soft and comfortable, yet flattering. it's a must have. now i want to get this in black!",5
"I love this top and cannot wait to wear it. the material is a nice weight, the color is pretty, and the fit is very flattering and comfortable. be aware that it does have an elastic waist and the design is very delicately sewn and could tear easily.",5
Only negative thing is that it sheds. and even that is not really very negative! i would buy it again in a heartbeat.,5
"I purchased this top in the white and love the contrast between the stripes and floral pattern around the neckline. it fit perfectly, however i'm concerned that it might shrink because then it would be too short. i am 5'3"" tall, 120 lbs. and small busted. it draped really nicely. small would give me a little more length but may be too loose.",5
"I love this dress but the top runs very small. i am 5'5, 102 lbs, small frame and the 0 was tight. 0 is my go to size at retailer. i had to return it. i wish i had bought the 2 now.",5
I love this dress and was hoping to get it in more colors. i was bummed when my size xs regular was out of stock. i would've even ordered it in a s regular but that was out of stock too. please get more in...love the deep red color!,5
Gorgeous fabric. love the crochet back of top & cut out sides of bottoms. runs small. i'm 34a - small top fit. 26-36 - medium bottoms fit.,5
"This dress drapes beautifully and fits tts. i purchased the green colour in a petite small. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 120 lbs. rather than feeling clingy, this dress skims the body and hides trouble spots while highlighting everything i like about myself. for that reason i went ahead and paid full price with no regrets. looks fantastic with black tights and black ankle boots or bare legs with cowboy booties. highly recommend!!!",5
"I went to the retailer store to look for an outfit for a wedding. i tried on a lot of dresses and the staff was super helpful with pulling items and making recommendations. after trying on their pulls, i browsed the store for myself and found this skirt. it wasn't in my size but i tried it on anyway and paired it with several different tops recommended by staff. this skirt looks great with every top-black, cream, white, long sleeve, no sleeve, short sleeve. i thought i had to get it for the versat",5
Very cute and flattering. very fitting in legs and thighs and i have fairly slim legs. i am a size 6 and 6 was very snug. i recommend trying these on in store or trying several sizes to see best fit.,5
"These are my saucy, fun jeans.  when the ps brought them over, i wasn't sure about them but at 5'3, they make the perfect ankle jean.  they look great with boots and are so comfy!  i typically wear a 26-27 but i sized down in these because they're a lower fit on me and i wanted the waist to be tight.  as the darling fiance says, they make your derriere look ""great!""  i'd snag these on sale ;)",5
"I have a long torso and wider back/thick middle in proportion to my narrow tights.  i was worried after reading other reviewers comments.  for reference i'm a 2 in pants, 26-27 in jeans, xs in retailer tops but for floreat and maeve i'm always a 6.  i ordered a size 6 and it was perfect.  with my long torso i expected this dress to fit weird but it was perfection.  in love.  i wore it with faryl robin lace up sandals",5
"I love ag jeans to begin with but even still sometimes certain styles miss the mark (at least on my body type). i was pleasantly surprised with this pair and even though they are pricey, i couldn't pass them up. they miraculously stay on my hips and i don't find myself pulling them up every few minutes. hallelujah! other than that they are  stretchy and soft with out losing their shape. they hit right at the ankle for me (5'2). the hem is frayed which i'm hoping doesn't unravel too much with was",5
I loved the color and style then put them on and didn't take them off! they are so comfortable cane believe it. they are going to be my fall staple,5
I ordered this dress in the red stripe and i love it. it is casual and easy to wear with flat sandals or booties. the dress is not really sheer like you might think from the picture and it included a nice knit under slip in a pale peachy pink shade that fits true to size as well. the dress has more of a soft woven cotton feel to it. the slip is not really necessary but nice that it is included. i looked at the blue color but it looks more like a tunic in the pictures. i think that the looks are,5
"I don't usually go for the ""tenty"" cut in a blouse, but this one has such pretty detail and with a little cardy, looks great! love the black and white detail and embroidery.",5
"I love the perfect length of these! i am 5'6"" and i love subtle capris which are very hard to find (unless i tailor them of course) but these are the perfect length and the color is great i have worn them twice and was stopped over and over again by people asking who made them. new favorite!! the waist runs a little tight but legs and tush are true to size!!",5
"I love this pant. it is so soft and has some stretch in it. the first pair i tried in a size 10 and the sales associate suggested trying a size 12 as ithis pant should not fit tight as it is a trouser. tie 12 is perfect. it reminds me of a ""retro"" pant,which i love.",5
I ordered this in the red stripe material. i love it! it is so soft and easy to wear. i'm wearing it as a bathing suit cover. a nice pink slip is included.,5
I bought this dress to wear to a fall wedding. it is absolutely gorgeous! the actual fabric is much more detailed in person. sizing is accurate. the dress is knee length. there is a little tulle underneath to give it the a-line shape.,5
"Based on other reviews, i ordered these trousers in my regular size 8 (dark grey) and up one size10 (black motif). the size 8 fit perfectly; and the size 10 are too big (returning). i am not sure what the other reviewers experienced, but size 8 in this brand fits, regardless of style. i also prefer the solid grey, but that is just a personal choice. i felt the black motif trousers looked like pajama bottoms.",5
"I saw this on the rack, and tried it on because it was just so beautiful. the beading and embroidery details are unlike any piece of clothing i've seen in a ready-to-wear store. it feels and wears much more like a couture piece.
i wasn't planning on making such a big purchase, but it's just so beautiful i had to have it. i doubt i'll find another item of such quality and craftsmanship for the price.
runs large- i'm normally a size 6 (135lbs) and the size 4 fit perfectly.",5
"I love ag for their soft, stretchy denim and flattering fit. bought these today and couldn't be happier! i usually order stevies in the petite ankle size, but the ""regular"" capri length fit perfectly skimmed my ankle.",5
"I am a big fan of ag, i'm sure i have 15-20 pairs. i will say that i have rejected some of their offerings in the past because the fabric has been weird: denim that is so stretchy it doesn't look like real denim, fabric is so thin it shows every lump or bump etc.. so i'm always cautious, especially with their stretch twill. that aside, these particular jeans in this gray color are awesome. ag nailed it: great color, supportive, slimming fabric, great length and rise. a job well done ag! 

howe",5
"I was hesitant to order this top since i didnt know how well the design would be made on the front. i liked it, but sometimes items are different when you get them. this shirt was as pictured! the design is well made and there are no stray strings and i think it's probably one of the nicer designs available. the top iis a dressier fabric but can be worn with jeans as well as dress pants. also, some shirts with this cut are skimpy in the front and leave more skin exposed than what you see here. t",5
I love this sweater. definite classic. i get lots of compliments on it.,5
I love this dress!,5
I bought this top in the wine color. i just love it. as soon as i wore it i received compliments because it has so many unique details. i bought a medium and it was just the right size.,5
"When i tried this top on, i started laughing. the two rows of ruffles are made of a starchy thick cotton, which, instead of falling by the hips, juts out like wings. it's also huge. cute idea, wrong material and placement.",1
"This looks like the perfect easy sweater with the white shirt appeal to it, but sadly the fit of this number is really off. it looks more like a tent. it must have been clipped in the back or something. i cannot see any scenario in which this would look good...",1
"I saw this dress on the girl working the fitting room at my local store. she had it knotted in the front with some cute cognac sandals. i immediately fell in love! i tried on the xs, my normal size, and it fit like a dream. so comfortable!! it was a little pricey so i held off but couldn't stop thinking about it. i went back the next day, caved & purchased. it's one of my favorite dresses for summer now. i love this brand so i wasn't surprised!",5
"I'm 5'10"", approximate size of model pictured, however this dress is at least 3 in shorter on me. the fabric is a bit thin and the v-neck is quite deep...
but i happily wore it on the beaches of puerto rico, added a jean jacket and epice scarf and wore it in paris. last week i wore it  belted ( as i saw a sales associate in antro do) with an open weave sweater and flip-flops on a warm boston day. don't count it out yet, it really is a chameleon piece that you can wear so many ways.",5
"Cute, easy to wear. perfect little top! will go with so many things. the scalloped shoulders add such a nice touch. i'm a solid 8 with a pretty large chest. i think i need to go up. not sure. about to order a 10 to see if there is a big difference. so, if you have a larger chest you may want to order two sizes.",5
This is really cute - with a statement necklace or without. jeans or shorts. love it.,5
I bought this sweater and love it! one of my favorites this season.,5
"Just a little scallop makes this top special. 
if your on the edge of a 10 i suggest sizing up. 
fabric crisp-well made and worth full price",5
"I love, love, love this skirt. very flattering. i am 5'7"",125# with a 27"" waist, and ordered a size 4 based on previous reviews. yes, it is snug through the hips. i think it will stretch a bit with wear; however, i imagine curvy ladies may want to size up (sadly, i was not blessed with much in the way of curves). the material is thick. the skirt is lined. the print is beautiful. this is one skirt i was happy to pay full price for rather than risk missing it.",5
"Love love! beautiful, soft, great color! very comfortable!",5
"I have worn this dress with a jean jacket, birkenstocks or a dressier wedged sandal. it washes beautifully and is super soft. would buy in different colors if there were more options. looks better in person.",5
Fits and lots nothing like picture. very wide like a tent dress!,1
"This bra is very cute and pretty comfortable. i usually wear between a 34d in elle mcpherson and this fit perfect. i got it in black and while it's really cute i was surprised how different the color looked in person vs. online. online it looked to me to have some purple to it, but it is definitely 100% black in person (just an fyi). i also thought the tassel was cute, but it does look a little cheap and flimsy in person. still a great bra.",5
"Love this skirt! it's definitely on the tight side, but is a stretchy material. i'm between a 6 and an 8 and went with the six because i liked the way it hugged my curves. as an hourglass shape i sometimes have problems finding pencil skirts - they either fit in the hips and are big at the waitband or the other way around. this one fit great throughout, and was both slimming in the front and flattering in the back. i was also worried that if i tucked anything into this skirt there would be weird",5
I bought this dress as a pool/beach coverup but it is so cute i think i will also wear it other times as well. it is very comfortable and lightweight. perfect for the hot weather.,5
"I adore this dress. i bought a little over a month ago and have already worn it many times- rare for me. it is so easy to throw on and yet it's stylish and flattering- i don't have the time or energy i used to get dressed up so i love this. when i bought it, it was knotted on one side in the front. that's the only way i wear it now. it just adds something to it and gives it more shape. i've washed it several times (laid flat to dry) and it has held up well. i'm definitely bookmarking this to buy",5
"This dress looks simple, but man is it unexpectedly sexy. and oh so comfortable! the deep v neckline and side slits elevate this from a simple tshirt dress to something else. add just the right accessories and this dress transforms. i have the xs and its just roomy enough without being clingy. and did i say how comfortable it is? the fabric is perfectly lightweight without being flimsy and color is a cool, saturated denim color. i receive compliments every time i wear it. love love love.",5
"This is a beautiful blouse and well made!!! i read the previous reviews and i'm usually between sizes 8 and 10, so i sized-up, and ordered size 12 and it fits well. i purchased the pink, and it's soo pretty! i'm very satisfied with my purchase, and i highly recommend this blouse.",5
Absolutely amazing! a must staple in every one's closet this season. i purchased the dress in a medium for a more relaxed look/feel. the silhouette is comfortable and makes for the perfect put on,5
"Tried the size small, regular. me: 5'6"", 34/35a-28-36, straightish shape, broader shoulders.
it's described as slim fit but i found the small to be a loose fit on me. i would almost consider trying the xs if i wanted something less baggy...but i think the style is meant to be very laidback. i tried to picture the extra material i had.
the color is a lovely denim blue and the length on me was just as the website describes. deep v neck but not to the point where i feel i'd need a cami, those of",5
This is definitely true to size. i tried both the small and medium on in the store and the small was too tight( this is meant to be a little looser like a tshirt) the medium was spot on. not too tight and not too baggy. i think it's a fun go to piece that can be worn with a jean jacket and sandels or booties. it looks like denim too which i wasn't expecting. way better in person!,5
"I received this skirt today and am absolutely thrilled! as a short and curvy lady, i feel most comfortable in fuller skirts (but not too poofy), and this one lies perfectly (does not make my hips look wide!). the colors are soft and very feminine, which also suits my style. it may seem like a springtime skirt, but i will start wearing it with tights and a sweater right away.",5
"I read the earlier reviews on this, and though i agree that the photo here does not show how wide and swingy the top is, i love it! it is so adorable and comfortable. i bought the petite s, and i am 5'2"", 118 lbs. it fit true to size in the shoulders. the petite hits just a few inches below my waist, so you might want to keep that in mind if you do not want it to be this short. the sweater part is soft, not itchy, and the poplin sleeves and ruffle are crisp but soft as well. because this is very",5
"Love this top! got it in white for a recent trip to paris - felt chic and cool during a bit of a spring heat wave in the city of lights. it runs somewhat small - i'm 5'7, 128 lbs, broad shoulders, and got the 6. my usual 4 fit but was a little snug. i would recommend going up in size in this style. the 6 looked better because it is supposed to be a boxy, swingy top.",5
"The color of this dress is just so beautiful - somehow both rich and airy! i believe this is meant to be a more relaxed fit, but that isn't quite my style. so to achieve more of a silhouette, i was lucky enough to stumble upon an xxs-p (petite) in store. i normally would never even try something on in this size, but it looked pretty generous so i decided to give it a try. so glad that i did! it gave more figure and i liked the length a bit shorter. with this dress, i think you can achieve the lo",5
"So cute! rompers are hard because they are so cute but rarely work for all body types. this one is so super cute. the material is so soft and comfy, feels silky. i got a small and fits perfect. i'm 5'4"" and 117lbs so it runs very true to size when most clothes from retailer run big. i love rompers but only have one other one. this is by far my favorite! i can't wait until it's much warmer and i can wear it all the time.",5
"Love this top! it's pretty, unique and well made. i did size down to a small for reference and still have a slightly oversized look.",1
"Absolutely adore this dress. soft and comfortable fabric, ankle length but could be knotted in the front to be shorten. i am usually a s but had to buy an xs. the neckline may be a bit too low, if you are flat-chested. if you happen to see this gem in stores... it is a must buy! it will sell out completely in two days. some customer went back to exchange the next day that it had arrived in-stores but it was sold out, so we had to order it. perfect for all seasons and layering.",5
"I created a summer capsule wardrobe for travel and this t-shirt dress fits in with my collection perfectly. it is well made, super soft and comfortable, launders well, and does not require ironing. it is substantial enough to provide coverage across the posterior and the cap sleeves and length are fabulous for visiting sacred places and dining out or as a beach cover-up. i love that you can simply throws this on and go or dress it up with a belt, add a scarf or kimono, or a jacket and voila.",5
Great coastal sweater. color in my opinion is a perfect rendition of coral. the sleeves hit just right for me to wear long or bunch them up. i can see this sweater paired with shorts or skinny jeans.,5
"I debated getting this top, and i am glad that i did! i got the pink, and it is a fun, vibrant color. someone suggested that if you are in between sizes, go up. i agree with that feeling; however, it is pretty true to size. it is preppy, cute, and classic.",5
"As the title suggests, i am very skeptical and scared of pencil skirts. i'm slim (sz 0) and on the shorter side (5'4''), but i have ""dramatic hips"", so i've always had a testy relationship with any clothing that exaggerates them. i'm obsessed with uniquely designed skirts thought, so i had to try this and i am so pleased i did!

the fit is great and not too tight, allows for a little room for ladies with hips. i only wish the zipper went down a little further so shimmying out of it were a little",5
"While the white version is a tad more twee, this one in black is edgier, more sophisticated. tts for my 33"" chested, broad shouldered self in a 4. all the unique details add up to an outstanding, versatile piece: how it blouses out in back; opaque enough to wear without a cami; the scallops?i may keep both colors!",5
"This top is large like with free people i got an extra small and washed it right away and put it in the dryer and it is soft and perfect. so comfortable and will be a go to top with jeans, pj bottoms or leggings/ i love the pocket and my cell phone fits perfectly. i am now ordering the other color. for reference i am 5.5"" and 125 pounds.",5
"I am 5'2"" and 125 pounds and wear a 4p. i ordered the size 4 with the willingness to hem them; my goal was to get this true high-wasted style, which is extremely flattering. when the pants arrived, i was first struck by their high quality fabric and the top notch tailoring. the fabric is substantial yet it drapes beautifully. the true high waist flatters, but the buttons and slant pocket details further whittle the waist. i am so happy with my purchase!",5
Love this top. beautiful. received a lot of compliments.,5
I love the design of this top.  the pattern is beautiful and the back unique.   i am a mom of two so i really appreciate the extra front coverage.  i can run around at the beach with my kids and not be worried about overexposure.  i am a 34d on top and purchased the large and it fits well.,5
"I have shirts and dresses from this brand, and they are great. i was happy to finally see a pair of pants! these are just as soft and well made as the other items. i would recommend you try them on. there is only a slight variation from one size to the next, so it will depend on what look you are going for. they are cropped at the calf, but can be ""pulled up"" for a more dressier look. i cannot say enough about the material. it is so soft and comfortable. they do wonders for your behind- i think",5
"I purchased this in white my normal size being a 2, a size 4 fit better on me. i love the crisp white top with jeans and sandals, so much that i just ordered the same top in the raspberry color. 

would definitely recommend.",5
"This skirt is a show piece! the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering for different body types. i got my usual size, even though i have a smaller waist and larger hips and thighs. the skirt looks cute with the split-back buttondown by cloth and stone. you will not regret buying this piece!",5
"Hesitated to try it on because it was ""t-shirt dress"" and my experience has been that fabric is unforgiving for dimples or imperfections   i was wrong with this one. it's great!  color is nice. fabric looks textured bc of the dye. the neck line is perfect (i like a lower v) and the length is great bc of the side slits. i tried it on with the front panel knotted at the bottom (how it was on the hanger) and i love it.  had to get. can dress up or down, but i'd say this has mostly a casual feel.",5
"I bought this well made cute top today and love it. it can be day time casual or dressy for dinner. you will want to probably wear a cami underneath since its see through. its perfect for summer! im a 36d, 5'7"" 135 pounds, and usually wear a medium, but the small fit perfectly with room to spare. cuter in person.",5
Great swim top. good coverage and very comfortable. be advised this is not reversible like title suggests.,5
"Saw these in the store and had to have them. i wear them rolled up. they are lightweight. whenever i wear them i want to smile. the birds with hats are so funny. i wear them to run errands, have worn them when flying, etc. can't say enough good things about these pants. they wash well, no ironing needed.",5
"I loved the criss cross part of this tank. however, it looked so frumpy on. the cut was just odd and if you are petite it felt like a tent. i was so bummed because that criss cross was awesome but it just looked so weird on. i returned it. the material felt nice too.",1
Beautiful top and beautiful bright color. this does run 2 sizes small in arms and chest unless you are very narrow in stature and flat chested . i am usually a size 6 and a 36c and broad shoulders and size 10 just its in underarm area. i have short torso so love the length but those with very long torso may find this blouse too short. if you get the right size this topics really adorable. my husband also gave it a big thumbs up.,5
"Love this top! tried it on in store...so glad i did since it runs large and i had to size down to a medium. the color is a beautiful camel and the material is soft...very grateful the fabric content did not contain dreaded wool, lol! therefore leaving it soft and comfortable to wear...the price tag was a bit much considering it is only a sweater vest but with retailer price equals quality so i don't mind spending the extra $!",5
"I ordered these in a xxs, a little nervous about them being too small, and i was very pleased with the fit. for reference, i'm 5'2, 98lbs. these are great for all seasons, the lining is warm, yet adds a pop of color when cuffed. the crowns on the birds are pretty nifty!",5
"I love this top! the neckline is so unusual and so flattering. i am normally either a small or xs, but this fit great in the xs. i was also able to wear a regular bra which is always nice since i am large chested. great top...highly recommend.",5
"The styling of this top is so cute but the fabric is thin, kind of scratchy & has
almost no give to it.  it is very uncomfortable on & is very restricting as far as
movement is concerned.   cannot recommend - back it goes!",1

"I tried on te regualr size (xs) as that is all they have in my store, and decided to get them anyway, even if a little long on me. why? because htey are so cute rolled up with the yellow color showing!

super comfortable, have not washed htem yet, but hipefully they remain a decent wuality.",5
"This sweater is substantial, well-made, fabric is thick and comfortable. the length is on the shorter side, not cropped but shorter, perhaps if they had petite, ti would be cropped. the sleeves are perfect length too on me, it looks shorter on the model, they hit at mys wrists (i do usually need petite length). it seems a simple top, but it is quite beautiful in person. i strongly recommend it, even for the price...

"I love the teal color of this t-shirt and the macrame design at the top is beautiful, however, the top is way too large.  i usually wear a size xs or s in retailer tops, so i ordered the size s, there is so much fabric below the chest it fits like a maternity top.  i know if i order an xs, i will have the same problem.  below the bust, the top is not flattering and it&amp;#39;s a shame.",1
I've had great luck with items from sunday in brooklyn & this vest is another fantastic purchase. the color/fit match the photos. the material is so soft. i've worn it quite a bit since i received it and it hasn't pilled. it's washed well too. the braided part can be folded down if you don't want it higher on your neck. it will still lay flat & drape nicely. it's perfect for cold weather. i'd love to see this come out in other colors too.,5
"This vest is so functional. i think it is much prettier in person than in this photo. it has a much softer look to it and is less orange, more tan. i've worn it with a lot of different things: over a sweater dress at work, with soft pants and a long-sleeve t-shirt, or skinny jeans/pants and a simple top. wish it came in other colors (gray, navy or green would all be amazing)...one of my favorite pieces this season for sure. i do think it runs a little bit large, but i think the next size smaller",5
"When i saw these lounge pants, i felt as though they were designed specifically for me. i love the cute bird design. i love the green/blue color of the fabric. the material is soft and inviting. give them a try. you won't regret it!",5
"This is such a great top that when my cat snagged it i bought a second version to wear in public and kept the snagged version to wear around the house or for working out. it is super comfortable and can be worn with so many things. definitely on the more casual side but you can dress it up slightly w/ jeans and booties, or it can be worn w/ leggings, jeans and tennis shoes, etc. i also bought the coral color in addition to the blue. if you're on the fence i would say you can't go wrong with buyi",5
Really like this tee but i do wish it was made of another material. i like the design. simple with a nice macrame detail. the material is a very plain with much to be desired. ultimately kept the shirt but would have loved it more if it was made with something that felt better quality.,5
"Sunday in brooklyn has been killing it lately with their tops! i could not decide between this and another of theirs, but i am glad i chose this one. first, the design is great. very cunning style: the sleeve length matches the length of the top tier, which gives this top a very finished look. the color is a beautiful jewel-like raspberry red with a bluish undertone. and, the fabric is a nice washable poly. i wore my usual size xs at retailer.",5
"This is a very cute top. i am 5'4'', 170lbs, 34dd, and a large fit great. it fit perfectly in the chest, but the top is meant to be baggy at the bottom and long (it covers my bum). looks very cute with skinny jeans. love it!",5
Fit great with moving room. colors very vibrant. just right for a house with lots of cool air conditioning!,5
"I have several lilka pj bottoms and i'm glad to add these ones with the adorable bird print to my collection! tts, soft flannel, striking colors, only wish they had pockets!",5
"This dress is as stunning in person as it is in these pictures! i'm petite, and so it's longer on me than it is on the model. i got a 4p and the waist was perfect! i thought it might look matronly as it was longer, but it looks classic. i feel like i could dress it down just a bit with flats and a cardi, or wear it to an event with heals and a wrap. it's so comfortable and forgiving in the waist and belly area, which is icing on the cake! i had absolutely no reason to buy it, but once i tried it",5
This pjs are adorable!! they run tts and are extremely comfortable!,5
"This reminded me of big bird in person and just adds volume to your body. i'm thin and usually wear a size 0, so i'm not sure who this may look good on.",1
"Pretty pyjama pants that can be worn running errands, dropping off kids.",5
"This dress is a winner! the material is not stiff like many neoprene dresses - it is soft and silky and has amazing drape. the dress is very flattering! the material is very stretchy even through the waist, so it is and easy ""perfect fit"" on different body types. i loved the shorter versions of the dress, but they weren't workable for me, but this length is perfect. and there are pockets that are sewn in with perfect detailing - they don't stick out or disturb the line of the dress.",5
I have no idea why this has bad reviews! how is there any left?! this is a beautiful piece that i had to have in both the navy and green. i love that it comes with a cami. it&#39;s very flattering and not too wide or boxy. the lace detail is amazing! i bought my usual size and it fits perfect. love this top!!,5
"This top in the remaining blue - green is not the top pictured.  it's like the photos posted in a recent review by inwonderland.  the color is deep and beautiful.  the neck is high, the lace is floral, there's a seam under the bust with a center pleat falling from it.  there's no reason for hesitancy at the sale price.",5
"This top is beautiful.  at the present price, grab it.  the fit was tts for me, a bit loose if anything.  the blue green color, which is not pictured, is shown in my uploaded photos.",5
"This dress fits really cute. i actually think it's cuter in person than on the site. really flattering. the skirt hits a few inches longer on me than it does on the model, so it's appropriate for work and networking functions. i'm 5'3, 110lbs. i got the 0 and it's great!",5
"When i was finally able to find my size available online, i didn't hesitate. i am 5'4"", 123lbs, 34d and size 27 jeans. i originally ordered a small...wow! was i surprised it was too small, and cropped. i returned and ordered a medium, received today...and i have to say, i was super happy. it fit perfect, in fact it fit much like how the model's fit in the photographs.",5
This is very practical. it goes with many things and is very comfortable....it can be worn with different leggings or with jeans! and it is well made! thanks retailer!,5
"Yes, it runs very large. i usually wear a m and ordered the xs/s. i like the oversize fit and i think this poncho is unique, chic and modern. definitely worth the price, especially on sale. very nice quality fabric.",5
Just bought this top in an xs and i can&amp;#39;t wait to wear it.  i&amp;#39;m 5&amp;#39;3 and 115 pounds. i usually stick with the petitie tops but the regular one fit me perfectly. you might need to wear a cami as it is a little see through.  a great addition to my wardrobe.,5
"This is the kind of weather i want to wrap myself up with a cozy and soft blanket. but i can't really walking around with a giant bulky blanket. this cardigan is as good as i can get. it's so soft, comfy and well made. nowadays most of the knitwear are made of dominantly polyester. this one is mostly natural material with has a much better feel than the man made kind.
i like how this garment is not too bulky and not too tight. warm enough for the breeze but not too thick. love it!",5
"I saw this online and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. my only problem was choosing a color. i got the black one. it is a bit hairy, but soft and smooth as well. it feels very high quality. it has two nicely placed buttons if you'd like it kept in place, but it's just as nice loosely draped. it will work well dressed up or down. it runs large, but clearly intended to.",5
"This dress has a beautiful shape. it was a onesie in a store (only one they had) and i'm glad i tried it on. usually i'm a 6 or 4. this is an 8, and it's a perfect fit. definitely size up at least one dress size. the knit shoulders are beautiful and the belt is slimming. i love the writing on it. it's a classic dress and it makes me feel beautiful and unique.",5
This is a great up-to-date twist on a must-have staple - a black (or grey) cardigan. easy flowing and flattering style and warm enough for fall weather.,5
"I am very glad i purchased these shorts on sale. bought the coral color in a large. 5'7"" 140lbs with a generous underside and long legs, i usually wear a m or a l in yoga pants. the l here fits really nicely--not too tight and enough length in the inseam so that i don't feel silly practicing outdoors in the park. the rise is also perfect.",5
Such a beautiful dress with my favorite print! it does run a size small if you ask me. the size 10 i got fits more like an 8. the corduroy belt really sets the waist off.,5
"The pictures do not do this dress justice. this dress is gorgeous, the color is beautiful, and it is so flattering on. even better, this dress is machine washable! simply hang it up to dry and it looks like it is fresh from the cleaners. i love this dress so much i don't even mind that i purchased it at full price, and now it is on sale. buy this dress for a special occasion -- it is so special.",5
Love this sweater. comfy and trendy. can't wait to wear with my new retailer knit leggings!,5
"Whimsical and elegant. fits a bit snug in rib cage, but that works well for me. i'm a 32c.",5
"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! the top portion fit a little smaller than the typical size i order. the zip side was a little snug, but the fit is very flattering! the lace detail and belted design are very pretty. the skirt portion has more volume than i tend to like, but it is it beautiful!",5
"Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs, and 4 was the smallest size available, so i ordered it. when i opened it, it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big, until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror, i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone.",1
"I ordered this in an xl and when i pulled it out of the bag, it seemed huge. (i wear both l and xl, depending on the sizing) when i tried it, it did look like the photo - it's meant to be a little voluminous. the arms were a little snug, so sizing down was out of the question. it looks great tucked in to a pair of flair jeans. i gave the asthetic four stars because of the design, which is just a teeny bit off. the lace is delicate too, btw, so care will be needed not to snag it.",5
"This tunic is flattering and high quality, just be sure you size down!",5
"This dress is as comfortable as it is adorable. i am 6'2"" and usually wear 12/14 but the 10 fit me. love, love, love this dress!!",5
"Super cute on.  i love the print and the tie detail and the fact that the tie actually tightened which makes the waste adjustable.    the slip is a tad tight, but it doesn't bother me, its stretchy so it's not uncomfortable.  i bought size xs-i usually wear a 2 in dresses.  i usually buy petite because of the length but this fell about 2"" above the knee on me which is perfect for work so i didn't need the petite.  i am 5'3"", 125 lbs.  i loved the soft fabric-fine for year round in southern cal.",5
This dress is lovely and easy to wear if you are short and you buy regular size (not petite). i am 5'1 and i bought the regular medium so the length of the front falls just above my knees. i can wear it to work without leggings. the other thing i love is it has pockets! and it fits generously - i weigh 140 lbs and will usually fit in a medium (if i don't breathe) and a large (if i use a belt). but in this size (medium regular - i can breathe! and i need a belt. ergo - i don't feel like i need to,5
"Lovely jumpsuit. can be dressed up or down. i agree with the other reviewers that in my normal medium, the torso length is a bit short, making the garment pull. i sized up to a large, and with room in the hips and the correct torso length, the jumpsuit works. the bust is cut for a smaller gal. for reference, i am 5'7"", 36a, 155lb.",5
"Beautiful lace shell! great with jeans for a night out, or with a skirt for a more formal affair. good quality, not itchy.",5
"Definitely size down it does run large however, it is a sweet floral print made of rayon so i would dry clean as rayon shrinks. i love tunic lengths and this one is a bit longer than most tunics but for me still works. there are 2 small pleats on the front and the ruffles on the neckline are a nice touch. it is made well. i have a long black sweater that will make this work right into the fall and winter.",5
"Really cute top! love the ruffle detailing and the pattern. quality could be slightly better since i slightly expected the material to be softer. either way, i'm happy with the top. got my usual xs and it fit perfectly. it's meant to be a looser top so i don't mind that it runs a little bigger.",5
"Love the design of this denim dress. so unique! i did buy a size larger than i would have normally looked at based on reviews. if on the fence, go up but do get this one. it has no stretch, so a size 8 waist measures 15"" flat, with 17 under the arms. not really for big busted girls. i am 5'8"" and the length is right at lower knee. worth the sale price for sure!!",5
"This dress is fun and flattering. love the pieced denim look and the a-line style. unlike other reviewers, i found this dress to be true to size for my pear-shaped figure. the length is long enough to wear anywhere, and i think it would be flattering on a variety of ages and figures.",5
"I was very patient with this dress. i was waiting almost forever till this dress gets on sale. when i tried my usual 6 size it was way too tight but i could zip it. ( i am 5'6'' 145 lbs). the dress covers my knees and it's a perfect length, so when i sit it does not show too much of my length so it's a work friendly. it has side pockets, which can be very comfortable as well. the cut is great, it's a line,the thickness of material makes belly look great (in case if you care). i also like color a",5
"I ordered this on a whim as i though, hey, i don't have off the shoulder tops let's try ti, looks cute...
i ordered the nude after debating, but glad i did, it is a bit warmer in color, and i need warm colors to complement my pale skin. teh nude almost has a slight pink hue to it (maybe i am seeing things). it is soft, not sure there is wool, i am not that sensitive to wool, felt soft to me.

size: i ordered the xxs as i think lately, retailer has been making things baggier, and on a shorter pe",5
"This is a great skirt and i have received so many compliments wearing it. it's soft as butter and adorable with the ruffle on the bottom. i do find it runs small. i usually wear a 27 in jeans or a small in various tops and bottoms (and occasionally find i can fit in a 26 or xs) but i purchased a medium in this skirt. this is a very versatile piece. so far i have worn it to work (i'm 5'6"" and it's not inappropriately short at all) with tights, heels, and a jacket, but i'm excited to style it for",5
Purchased this in two sizes because other reviews said it runs small. i found that it was true to size for me .cant wait until it is warm enough to wear it!,5
"Love! the perfect go-to black legging! i bought two pair! comfy waist band/not too tight, no muffin top! you won't be disappointed. buy them!",5
I've been looking for an off the should sweater like this for over a year! looks great on and doesn't itch! can't wait for fall so i can wear it!,5
"The lace on this is gorgeous. it's feminine and elegant and fancy! definitely know if peplum style tops work for you before purchasing. if you have a large waist, it will just make you look bigger. but the top portion is nice and fitted, so i think it's very flattering. i'm 34c, 140b and got the small. fits great.",5
"Based on the reviews of others, i ordered this dress a size larger than i usually wear and it fits perfect. i am an 8, so i got this in a 10. this is the perfect casual dress for pretty much anytime of the year -can be worn with sandals in the spring and summer, or boots in the winter.",5
"After reading all reviews, i didn?t know what to expect, but i really loved the design so i ordered it any way. how positively surprised i was! this dress has a structure. the fit is great, just right in all places. the length hits right at the knee. i was afraid it would be too heavy for a denim dress, but it is actually thin and soft, not hot at all. for better understanding of the fit, i am 5?7?, 144 lb. and 34c. i?m between s and m in tops because of my wide shoulders, but size 8 in this dre",5
"This top is ""comfort wear"" or something i would wear to feel comfortable and cozy on the weekends but not something i would wear to work. because of that it is not an item i would traditionally purchase at retailer. that said, it is one of the best comfort clothing pieces i have found in a long time and i fell in love with it. i like the color which is good for transitioning into spring time, it is a thicker material which is great for transitional weather but also makes me more comfortable",5
"This color is perfect: deep and rich. it is exactly as it looks on-line. the velvet is super-soft on the outside, while the inside is more of a woven finish. it makes it a little less cozy, but the drape is great. the fit is slim across the shoulders and chest, and full everywhere else. the waist is lower in the back than the front, so it sits lower on the hip. i'm 5'4, 140, 34b, and i got a small petite, because i liked where it hit my waist better. this means i won't be wearing it without tigh",5
It's just not for me and i really like it. it's made very well and it looks great from the front. not so much from the side. i'm a 36c and this shirt bells out a lot from my chest...so much that i will be returning it. i look like i have an extra 20 lbs. on me.,5
This is the 4th pair of current/elliot jeans i've bought.  i'm 5'4 so the length is perfect for flats.  they are so soft and cozy. wish they had a design on the pockets but love them none the less!,5
"Fit, length and design were perfect. i took this skirt on a recent business trip and it transitioned perfectly from meetings to cocktail with an accessory change.",5
"I really liked these leggings, so comfy! they are so soft and the waistband is thick(about an inch wide). i am a size 10 in pants, i got a size m. i have a 33 inch inseam and these came down to my ankles. these leggings have textured stripes at the calf and hip.",5
This skirt is shimmery without being too much. rich colors and perfect fit tts nice elastic middle so comfortable and gorgeous.,5
"Online photos do not do this skirt any justice i agree with a previous poster. i normally never buy anything brown, but there are pops of teal and magenta throughout. you can't see the gorgeous shimmer and the interesting layered colors online. in addition, this skirt has a stretch waistband (plus for the holidays!) and is so flattering, not too tight, but shows just enough of your curves, physique. i like that the skirt is longer as well - will look cute with boots. i purchased the size medium",5
"Love love love this pair of underwear (yes, i'm writing this about underwear). they're comfortable, flattering, and no vpl (visible panty line) without having to wear a thong.",5
"This is an absolutely fabulous skirt. i cant wait to wear it. the biggest challenge is finding the best way to accessorize it. i am an artist and have lots of clothing, but haven't created that ab fab combo yet. i will!!!!",5
When i got this skirt i figured it was a muted sweater skirt. what i got was a much fancier sparkly sweater skirt. the blue is more of a bright sparkly teal and gold thread is woven throughout. oh my it's spectacular. really beautiful.,5
"I've been searching for a velvet top or dress for awhile. this arrived yesterday and it's absolutely beautiful. the color is rich and the fabric is thick and feels and looks like a very expensive, high quality item. i got it with the 25% off promo but it's worth every penny of the full price. can't wait to wear for the holidays! get this dress!",5
"I love this dress--i saw it on the way out of the store and was struck by the gorgeous color and rich velvet fabric and had to touch it and then try it on. i did not find it to be tight in the shoulders at all, nor do i think it looks cheap--on the contrary. the shape is indeed boxy, but it is still very flattering and comfortable. i wore it to a christmas brunch and got a ton of compliments. the only drawback for me is that it has to be dry cleaned. for reference, i am 5'6 1/2"" and usually wear",5
"I love this shirt! red + navy is one of my fave color combos, and the vintage feel is fantastic. the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting, but it's a good thing. the top isn't heavy, but the knit gives it more texture & interest.
this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look...covered, but form-fitting and flattering.",5
"Either this rouching is going to accentuate your waist or it's going to accentuate the fact that you just had a baby and ate too much linguini. unfortunately i have 10 more pounds to go and sadly this dress pointed that out.

that said, i had to give it five stars all around because it's good quality, design, etc.. it'll be great but not for me. 

got a medium and it fit nicely (with the exception of pointing out that i still have baby belly to lose)-- 5'3, 34d, 150 pounds. hope this was hel",5
"These jeans are extremely soft to the rich, as well as stretchy and flattering. they do not lose their shape after a whole day of wear. i am 5'3"" and the ankle length fits me as full length. i am a big fan.",5
"I ordered these along with the regular ag stevie jeans and there is a definite difference in fabiric and cut. i liked the darker fabric but it was thinner and stretchier that the more ""denim"" version. the cut was also looser in the thigh and seat area which made for a looser, less flattering fit. returned it and kept the regular ag stevie.",1
I am very pleased with the quality and fit of this dress.the reader outfits next to the listing were darling. i do not care for the model shot. i think the dress is true to size and well constructed.,5
"Oh look i have a booty and would look at that--i have a waist too!  yes this dress is way casual for its price point (soft stretch jersey in a heathered wine color) but it's all forgiven because it fits me like a glove.  i really love the gathered waist detail and what it visually does to my non-hourglass body. wish there were more colors available, i would pick them up in a heartbeat.  i purchased the medium petite.  my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall, 140#, 36dd, 28"" waist, 35"" hips, wide",5
"This skirt is a real ""dress up"" piece. it is simply stunning and indeed appears to have been designed by an artist. the aqua blue lining adds a definite pop of color while the shimmering knit outer layer is simply lovely. i plan to wear it out to dinner with friends this weekend and know that i will receive lots of compliments",5
This skirt is a dream. so so beautiful. looks way cute with brown boots. give this a go. don't listen to any negative review. this skirt is perfection.,5
These leggings are super comfy. i took the advice of other reviewers and ordered a size down and the leggings fit wonderfully. lately i've been having a problem with leggings falling down at the waist and these stay up nicely so i was very pleased. the leggings have a slight itch because of the sweater feel but they are very warm and i enjoy wearing them.,5
"I don't know how this dress looks on your monitor. on mine - it looks dark green. which it is! i was pleased with this aspect since i had hoped it would be as pictured despite the color description as ""slate."" that aside, it was a bit too large on me, and since i am on the shorter side at 5'4"", i looked a bit like a child's doll in it. i wish it had looked better on me because the color is beautiful, and so is the quality.",5
"Beautiful sweater!! i love the color and the fit. the cowl neck isn't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy. it comes down to the low hip on me. very soft and cozy. i purchased the aqua in xs. fits perfectly and i'm 5"" 5' 127lbs.",5
"I thought these were pretty on the website, but in person they look like a work of art! the colors are vivid -- bright reds, pinks, greens, blues, yellow -- with flora, fauna, houses, writing, type and so many other things on a white and cream background. they are very soft, medium-weight flannel. for me they run true to size. i wish they had pockets, though!",5
"I've been looking for exactly this. i really love it. it is heavy, but made extremely well and on sale a great price!",5
"I've tried or bought nearly every retailer cashmere sweater this season. this one fits the best and the yellow is a bit darker in person, not quite mustard but a deep rich yellow. i wish they would offer more colors.",5
Love these lounge pants. i live in florida and was worried they might be too heavy. not the case at all. very soft and lightweight. so comfortable!!!,5
"I was really excited about this sweater, but the fit was terrible. the sleeves were the right size, but the body of the sweater was a tent - absolutely no shape. they must have clipped the sweater on the model. for reference, i'm 5'4 and 120 pounds and ordered a size small.",1
Caught a sale in oct and purchased the gray. beautiful light gray. i am normally a med or lg and the small in this sweater was perfect. i am larger in the bust so it is not boxy on me. added a delicate pin to the shoulder and it was darling for our casual christmas dinner.,5
"Looking for a stylish rain resistant coat to wear to ireland this fall and looks like this could fit the bill. the 30inch length is perfect. the faux fur lined collar and opening edges is a lovely touch, fur ends about 6 inches in so not fully lined, but great for weather in 50's-low 60's with a sweater added . ample room for that. i love the look, wish the pockets were just a bit bigger, i can barely fit my hand in. but overall i think it's a keeper.
i ordered m/l and am usually a medium or la",5
I bought this in aqua. the color is beautiful. the quality of the cashmere is great. i have worn this 3 times since purchasing! this can be dressed up or down. the cowl neck is not overwhelming and looks great with a shorter chunky necklace or even a scarf. flattering hem line. very versatile.,5
Shirt fits great! i wore it for work and got lots of complements. looks very elegant. i also got the pants featured on the model since i liked the outfit so much ;),5
"Beautiful piece, very well made and drapes well!!! i love it!!!! runs a little big, i'd go a size smaller.",5
"Very cute in person, too. soft to the touch and comfy. as a person on the shorter side the roll up cuffs sold me on these pants! can't wait for it to get cool enough to wear them.",5
"I love camisoles like this, and retailer always has great ones! it has a nice length, so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan. it's fitted, but not tight.",5
"This is a beautiful sweater. high quality cashmere was used as it is very soft. as other reviewers stated, the sweater does run large. so i purchased one size down and ordered an xxs, for a perfect fit. i went with yellow, which is a great color. this is not high low, which i love! i am so thrilled, that just as soon as i'm finished writing this review, i'm going to purchase another sweater in red.",5
I bought this blouse in a size 4 (my normal size) to pair with winter white slacks and gun metal pumps. it was a hit. i felt beautiful and professional. and received many compliments at work as well as at an after work gathering the quality is surprisingly sturdy given the lace work. the collar and cuffs really set the design off. this top is much more impressive in person.,5
"This skirt is gianormous! i usually take an xl or l, so i ordered both. the waistband on the xl was so huge, i didn't even try it on. i feared it would not stay up! so i tried the large, and it was big as well. i think i would have needed a medium. but as it is, it is not the cute a-line that appears in the picture. (i wonder how they even got it to look like that !?!?!) it is huge, hip-y, and bunchy. yuck.",1
"Bought the aqua because sizes were sold out. the bright color will be a welcome change this winter among all my neutrals. it's lovely, soft, well-fitting, and i only hope we have a few days in the south so i can wear it. well worth the price. would be a lovely wardrobe addition for any age, changed by what it's worn with...shoes, accessories,",5
This shirt is beautiful and well-made. the lace is soft - not scratchy at all. looks great with a cream or gray cami underneath.,5
"Love, love these flannel sleep pants. i bought a pair 3 years ago and have been on the look out for the style again. these are truly the most comfortable pajama pants i have ever owned.",5
"I recently ordered this and am so glad i did. i absolutely love it! my hips and butt are not tiny, so i was very nervous that this would be a giant pouf on my lower half, but it lays perfectly flat and has a very gentle a-line, contrary to other comments. i am 5'4"" and 130' but the xs fits perfectly and keeps me looking trim. the waist sits just barely below my natural waist. very happy with this purchase; would buy more if there were additional colors - who doesn't love an elastic-waisted skirt",5
Bought this dress in store after trying it on. loved it. it's sexy with the lower cut front. the fabric is flowy and breathable. runs true to size. usually wear a 10 with my hips but the 8 fit better on top.the sides are well designed so your bra doesn't show. i'm 5''6' 32g size 29/30 jeans and athletic/hourglass built. i can't wait to wear it out. the pictures don't do it justice.,5
"I really like these shorts. i'm quite petite and have a hard time finding shorts to fit other than high end denim brands. these are great b/c of the sizing, i wear a 24 in most denim and the 24 in these fit perfectly. also love the length, not too short or long! going to order a second color, i have the plum and love it.",5
I couldn't wait to try on these shorts after reading all the positive reviews about them. my local retailer had them in the bright blue and coral in my size 26 and 25. i purchased the 26 and am content with them. they are a very lightweight cool pair of shorts. they do have a little stretch to them and the length is perfect.. i have to note they do wrinkle a bit but perfect summer staple. .,5
"This top is wonderfully comfortable and well made. i've taken a few accidental naps while wearing it because i was just so comfortable. at the same time, i receive complements on the shirt every time i wear it. itt pairs well with so many types of pants. the only negative is that i only own one (the cream color). i regret greatly that i did not purchase it in all available colors when i had the chance! i really hope to see this top come back again later!",5
The color was very different and vibrant. chose to size up for extra room and length,5
Very small! so disappointed! they did not even have a size for me to exchange a day later when they arrived!,1
"This runs very short. i had to size up so i could wear as a dress. still too short to wear to work with a cardi but adorable to wear to daytime summer events and date nights with hubby. i am 5'6"". length may work better for shorter women. love the style and fabric. very feminine, float and easy to wear with sandals on a hot summer day.",5
"I purchased this in the light red, and love it!!! this top is so incredibly soft and ridiculously comfortable.  definitely worth buying.  the material is high quality and can easily shift from season to season.  wear alone with shorts and wedges for summer or put it over a long sleeve top,  or even a holding horses jean shirt with a pair of black leggings and boots for fall.  
absolutely love the softness and the consistency of the fabric.",5
These shorts are very flattering. will def. purchase another pair.,5
"This tunic is a great length - i'm 5'4"" and it hits me mid/lower thigh. it's so soft and flowy which i love. i got a medium which is my normal size so i would say it runs a little big given that i'm almost 5 months pregnant with my second but it will still look and feel great post baby. arm holes are big but a cami can fix that. i got both colors available: the ivory and light red.",5
"I *love* this tunic. i'm 5'5"" and can wear it as a dress with bike shorts or leggings. it is so soft and comfortable, and i love the pink color--very versatile. my favorite thing about this piece--i am a 36dd and haven't bought a button down shirt in years until this tunic, which fits over my chest and is so flattering! many reviewers are saying that this tunic runs large--i agree, but for those of us who are busty, it's an opportunity to wear a cute, breezy style with buttons and a collar!",5
This dress is so beautiful in person. i actually am currently wearing it with jeans and i get so many compliments on it. this picture on the website does not really do it justice. very flowy beautiful top/dress.,5
I ordered it online so i wasn't sure how thick the sweater coat would be and when i received it i was pleasantly surprised at the thickness and high quality. definitely worth the price!,5
I agree with the other reviews! perfect color and weight to the dress. should wear well in summer and fall. i'm 5'5'' 34c 140lbs athletic and got the 6 regular. fit well and the length was perfect with flats.,5
"I love these shorts! they are cuter in person than online. they fit perfectly--casual, somewhat loose, airy feeling. i am 5'3, 105 lbs, took my usual size 25. i wear shorts a little lower on my waist, and i prefer the looser fit. if you plan to wear them up higher on your waist, you can probably size down, but i didn't want to worry about shrinkage, and i wanted them to be easy and comfy. they washed nicely (machine wash, cold, laid flat), light iron touch up. i ordered in moss green, nice color",5
"This top does run large. i'm 5'8 142 lbs and usually a medium. i bought a small and probably could have gone xs. that said, i love this top. its soft and comfy and swingy. i bought the light red and its pretty true to the online color.",5
"The light red color is really nice. i ordered an xs but usually order small, because of the cut and it was perfect. the fabric is heavy but loose. the collar stands up nicely and the buttons lay flat. i purchased this beautiful piece on sale, but i would have paid full price.",5
"Have been on the hunt for decent shorts all summer. as an elder, i need some length, comfort, style and attractive fit. these meet all the criteria. i'm 5'3"" and got the 31's. they're lightweight but substantial enough to keep their shape. love the faux cuff too. they stretched a bit but still have a perfect fit. got the grey on sale and getting 2 more in other colors left in my size at full price. so good!",5
Beautiful dress. the details are lovely. it feels a little bit like a nightgown. i always wear a slip. bust does run a little small so i unbutton the first few buttons. armholes feel a little small also.,5
"I can tell this is will be a ""go to"" shirt this summer. simple lines, yet a little ""different"" style - soft stripes, slits on the side seams and short, but not too short that it bares the stomach. it will look great with jeans, dressier with slim white pants or skirt or a pair of nice shorts. i don't usually go for button-down shirts, but this one was a bit unusual and caught my eye immediately. the fabric is soft yet holds it's shape.",5
"I tried this on a whim during the sale with no real intentions of buying but the moment i put this on i feel in love! the denim is soooooooo soft. it is heaven! seriously one of the most comfortable pieces i have ever tried on. the fit is very flattering and it can be worn multi seasons so..... it went home! that night i put it on and walked doen the stairs and my two year old daughter said ""mommy is so pretty""! . score! this dress is so simple and can be styled so many ways. plus it seems very",5
These have become my go-to shorts as i can dress them up or down,5
Legs are too wide. the fabric is rough to the touch.,1
True to size and love the color. great to wear dressed up with wedges and a blouse or dressed down with some mephistos and a tee. linen fabric makes them light for summer heat,5
"Love! love! love! this top! i saw this online and immediately knew tha tthis had to be in my wardrobe. i wear a lot of navy....(in my estimating the classiest color there is...black is passe'). it is simple, very wearable with pants, with skirts. the very thin stripe adds interest, without really being a pattern that conflicts with other patterns. i did have an issue with some threads that were randomly hanging from sleeve cuff...but nothing important. yes, it is cropped...very much so!!! so, if",5
"This dress is breathtaking in person: the back tie, the lace on the sides, the hem, the sleeves, the pleats at the chest, and the liner is opaque so it's not see-through. but it's very white, baby doll cut, and very short. in order to avoid the maternity, wedding-ish look, a few rules must be applied (thanks to retailer stylist ): buttons all the way up, a belt is a must to break the monotony of the all-over white and lace look. i purchased size 2 regular, and it still falls about 3 inches above m",5
"This is an understated elegant denim dress. the fabric color is just the right fade and thickness (not too thin and not too thick) which is appropriate for most occasions. it?s very soft and can get a bit wrinkly but nothing major. my local retailer has only the regular size and it's true to size, size 6 (my usual size for holding horses brand) fit well around the bust and waist area (i?m 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips; busty gals may want to size up). this dress shows cleavage so if you?re conscious like",5
"This shirt is really cute. it's shorter than most - and it's supposed to be that way. if you don't want your midriff showing if you stretch - this shirt isn't for you. it has slits on the side also. the material is super light so will be great for summer. i just loved the way it fit and that it's different. i ordered an xs and i'm about 5'5"" and 120 lbs.",5
Love these shorts - got 2 pairs on sale just because it's hard to find shorts that fit nicely and are comfy with a great length.,5
"This bathing suit has everything. i especially love the ruching in the waist and the boy short bottom. finally the coverage my booty needs. i've worn it dozens of times and it still holds its quality and looks brand new. i get a lot of compliments every time i wear it.
the only drawback is it doesn't dry very quickly. after a dip in the pool or the lake it stays wet for hours even when i'm laying out in the summer heat.",5
I tried these on in my local store and immediately loved them! they are so flattering on my hourglass shape. the flare leg balances out the hips. great quality and very comfortable. i know i will get so much wear out of these. i bought a size up from my usual size and they fit perfectly.,5
"This suit was high quality, and a cute design. however, it is clearly made for a lean body type.",1
I love this!! great quality and super cozy. perfect to throw on for casual summer nights.,5
This is a great quality product with unique design,5
"I was very excited about ordering this top as i'm tall girl (6 ft) and i like my back well covered. i liked both style and design of the top on photo but when the package arrived i was very disappointed with the material. this top is incredibly thin and see through. though fabric is nice and soft, it feels more like a pajama top. all curves & bumps immediately stand out and it doesn't look flattering. i ordered 2 colors grey and black size large and returned both, although they were true to size",1
I bought a size 8 a few years back not my regular size but when used it tend to sag. so this time i bought a size 6 my regular size.,5
"This is definitely my go to top for work, weekends or night out with the husband. i've worn it with skinny jeans, black tights and skirts. it goes with just about anything. easy to accessorize with a simple long chain necklace or a statement piece. i think the gray combo was a bit more flattering than the green combo.",5
"I love the colors on this dress, very nice on a pale skin. i ahd this in my wish list for so long, and it finally went on sale. i ordered it and was very pleased. only drawback is the collar was a little irritating (but i am ok with it). it fits like a glove (o), i didn't think it would as there are no petites, but that worked for me, the lace pattern is classy. and the hem is totally fun. great purchase (maybe petite would not have bothered my neck).
115 lbs, 30 dd, 26.5 in waist",5
Cute tunic.  fits on the fitted side but i love it with a vest layered over. nice material.,5
I agree with other reviews.  this is perfect to throw on for running errands or just hanging out at home.  super soft and comfy.  got the blue and now want the grey.,5
"This top is my go-to running errands top on the weekends, its super comfy and not to warm to wear throughout all the seasons. runs true to size and i get a bunch of compliments on the quality!",5
"This long sleeved tee is soft and beautiful. the swing design is so pretty and flattering. the seams along the front and back are a lovely addition. i also appreciate the higher neckline, which is increasingly hard to find in these kind of tees. would love it in more colors. i bought the black. i tried the white as well, but it was too transparent for this particular style and the tank top underneath gave it a sporty appearance. not horrible, but not what i wanted, so the white went back.",5
"The delicate detail at the neckline on this sweater adds such a pretty yet subtle touch.
i layer it with various camis for a different look each time.
i ordered the dark yellow and it is a very unique and rich shade, and goes well with so other many colors.
looks gorgeous with a mint or aqua cami for a peek a boo effect.
classic yet unique!
runs very true to size.",5
"I bought one size up in these fun cropped pants. i am petite but wanted these to fit longer, so i ordered a regular size. they are perfect. there is a nice patterned texture to these pants that is hard to see in the pictures. they are worth the price!",5
"This chambray is super soft! it has such a great feel and texture. i love the detail and design on the front. it adds just the right amount of interest without making the top feel busy and still very neutral in color so you can dress it many different ways. i'm not sure how this fits in comparison to other holding horses shirts/tops, but i had to size up one from my typical retailer size because of the my (which isn't large!). so excited to get a lot of use out of this!",5
"These cords are beautiful in the wine color and fit very well! i am 5'1 and got the petite size and felt they were a little to short, i know they are cropped flare but they hit me at a weird place. hindsight, i probable should have ordered then one size up!",5
"This is the most intricate, delicate, beautiful dress i have seen in a long time! the pale blue, coppery brown, and dark purple tones are so complimentary of fair skin, dark hair, and light eyes. unfortunately my normal size was far too snug, especially on my hips, and this is now sold out. the fabric has no give, so i would say with any curves, size up if you can find this beauty. i'm heartbroken to be returning it!",5
Very comfortable shirt.  washes up nicely with just a little ironing on the pleats.  cute detail of colored thread on buttons.  just a tad tight in the shoulders but not distracting.  no button placket chest gapping.,5
"I bought this tunic over christmastime at full price. i absolutely adore it! in my opinion, it isn't too thick or too thin. i got my usual size large and i think it fits perfectly! there are side slits, so it's perfect with skinny jeans or leggings. it's flattering because of the vertical stripes in the fabric. also with the grey color, there is a difference in the two fabrics that are used in the construction, so this adds some additional visual appeal. i haven't had any problems with snagging",5
"I am in love with this tunic, i wear it with everything, jeans, leggings and just tights! super comfy, quality design. runs a bit large but i like that.",5
Comfortable and cute. versatile colors that can be worn with virtually anything.,5
I get a ton of compliments on this. cute and comfortable. you can't go wrong.,5
Not a pretty blouse - it's quite utilitarian in design - and it runs enormous.,1
"This is a lovely jacket. it is easily paired with different bottoms and tops, and is such a fun take on the standard blazer with the beautiful ruffle pocket-detail. they are not actual pockets though, which i thought would have been an easy thing to incorporate. my chief issue with the fit is that it is a tad boxy. i am a standard xs/xxs and this runs just a tad big and a bit wide. but unbuttoned it falls seamlessly. if you use the clasp, it actually looks bigger. regardless, i love it and was o",5
This is a beautiful jacket. the fabric is soft and drapes wonderful. truly a great addition to any staple in your wardrobe. i am having the sleeves shortened as i prefer a more 3/4 length.,5
"I am 5'5, 150lb, generally size medium shirt, size 6 or 8 pants and bought a size 8. i have had two c-sections so my stomach has some problem areas, which can be easily highlighted in a swimsuit- not this one! i felt good, it hid my problem spots, showed off curves and stays in place! i can't speak to the durability of it yet, however, it makes me feel great, and that is tough when i am in a bathing suit. that in itself makes it worth the price! try it!",5
"I bought these pants in the wine color and i love them! i found them to be true to size. i always wear a 27 in pilcro and these were no exception. i am finding the cropped flare silhouette to be so versatile. they are more ankle length than cropped on me as i am 5'3"" but i think i prefer this. these pants can easily be dressed up or down - have worn with a dressy top and heels as well as a denim shirt and ballet flats. super cute!",5
"I really like this blouse. it's hard to find a short sleeved button down that the sleeves don't stick out and look weird. this one does not have this problem. it is a bit sheer, but i don't mind wearing a cami with it. it is flowy... but not boxy/baggie. has a very nice, flattering drape. i'm 5'3"", 110lbs., 32c, petite frame. the 00 regular fits great. i'm often a petite (especially in pants and long sleeved tops)... but went with the regular size here bc i wanted the longer length.",5
"These feel so soft and amazing. i especially love that the length work for me, just a tiny bit long and i am 5'4. i did find that they ran smaller than my pilcro and other jeans.",5
"I thought i'd be the exception - these pants are super cute - great fabric and color - kind of loved them - but they do run small - by about one size. just something to keep in mind while ordering. other than that - they are lovely, well-made pants.",5
"This is my first one piece bathing suit, and i absolutely love it. the quality is great ! the color doesn't fade.
i usually wear a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 and it fits perfectly.",5
I loved this top so much i bought both colors! soft and warm without being too thick or bulky.,5
"This is a terrific top!  the supima cotton is super-soft; the black, a deep black.  i love that antho is listening, and that it's made in the usa!  the lines and flow are beautiful and flattering.  i bought the medium and am a reliable size 8 top/medium, 34f.  the sleeves are nice and long.  don't miss out on this classic tee, friends!",5
Great dress that is very flattering. works well with flats or can be dressed up with heels. perfect for travel because the material doesn't wrinkle. would highly recommend this dress!,5
"These cords are great--lightweight for fl winters, and the bootcut flare bottom is super cute with ballet flats or booties. i am 5'10"" and typically a size 8; the size 29 fit perfectly. they have a little stretch to them, which is great. very flattering--wish i could order in more colors!!",5
"I've been looking for a navy shirt for some time and this is it. it's soft, drapes nicely but it's not as dressy as silk shirt would be. the navy is really blue, not a black-navy like so many. i've washed and dried it in the machines and it came out well. shrank just a little, but that made it perfect. for me it was true to size because i liked the slightly over-sized boyfriend fit, yet it still has shape. if you want a fitted shirt, go down a size or look for something else.",5
The weight and drape of this shirt is wonderful. it is very comfortable while still being flattering. you could wear it with jeans and sneakers or heels. fits true to size and the navy color is very deep.,5
"I love this top! i just bought it on sale so the price was great but it would have been totally worth it paying full price! great quality, unique, and great fit. i look forward to wearing it all year!",5
"I absolutely love this dress! beautiful prints and design. i would say to size down though as it is rather flowy. i am normally a small and went to an xs, and it fits much better. this is definitely a keeper!",5
"This top is exactly what i was looking for. rich olive color and very versatile. great as a lightweight jacket, casual or dressed up button up. i purchased a medium and it fits great. 5'7"", broad shoulders, narrow waist, and full hips.",5
"I love this dress so much - comfortable, flattering and really pretty. i wish i could buy this dress in every color!",5
"I love this shirt - it is very soft, and has a nice cut and drape. fits true to size. wish there were more colors!",5
"Love these level 99 pants. ""newport"" style. dress them up or down. wearing mine today with a moth top i also got at a. looking kind of 70s chic. light jeans for a hot day.",5
"I almost passed this in the store, but i am glad that i tried it! i really like that the fabric is so soft and has a ""blouse"" feel... and is machine washable! yay! love nice blouses that don't need to be dry cleaned! i would describe the material as thicker, so some may not like this for warmer weather. looks great with a long necklace like the minuet! i am typically a small and purchased this in an extra-small and still have plenty of room.",5
"In love! just wow. beautiful colors although they're dark you can still see all the variations. the flannel is light and not too heavy. there's visible black lace just below the shoulder. pretty buttons. ordered the large, my normal size and it's a perfect fit. roomy but not oversized. so well made i think this will be a favorite for years.",5
"I am 5'5"" normally about 120lb, but i'm about 145lb now at 9 months prego. i purchased the small. i can't resist buying retailer clothes, even though they might not fit me currently! however, because this shirt is drapey, it actually fits over my baby bump now and it will be perfect as a nursing shirt and then regular shirt later. it is so soft and great quality. will be cute dressed up for work or down with jeans!",5
"I'm only 5'3"" so i ordered a small but i have a larger rear (size 4-6) end and bust (32dd). the small gave me plenty of room in the top. the bottom area was definitely meant for someone with a smaller butt but i don't feel over exposed or anything. the fabric on the bottom is thick which is really nice. it makes the body seem slim and keeps the white from being see through even when wet. the long sleeve design is also awesome! i have gotten numerous compliments on it. the top has an inner liner",5
"I am 5'3"", 28/38 and got the sp. had no issues whatsoever, and love the colors.",5
"I love this dress. like another reviewer said, it's the perfect teacher dress. i wore it on the first day of school. it's comfortable and flattering and super cute. i received lots of compliments.",5
"This is an adorably gorgeous swing dress. the fabric is soft and flowy, and everything a swing dress should be. i was concerned that it would be too short, but it's the perfect length-fun while still being classy. a nice, chunky, eccentric bib necklace and nude sandal wedges would complete this outfit beautifully. highly recommend!",5
I ordered this in sand and loved it so much when i received it that i went back and ordered it in black as well. it is very flattering and sexy!,5
The cut of the top portion of the dress is off. i tried on the s in-store & it bunched up in the breast area. i ordered a sp hoping the petite would fix the problem - nope - still bunched up. for reference i am a 34b. i would have kept the dress and given 5 stars if it wasn't for said flaw.,1
"I, sadly, only noticed this top once on sale. i tried on the xs and it was just a bit big, i would need the petite, so i had to leave it behind (115 lbs, 30dd) - but it is adorable, can be dressed up and classy, casually with jeans, or sweetly, so many ways... love the subtle polka dots... oh well, i am sure i will find something similar i love!",5
"I grabbed this dress in green when i saw it on sale (plus there was an additional percentage off that day online) and they had my size. while it's slightly loose in the body of the dress, that will probably tighten up after the first wash since it's rayon - then it should fit like a glove. i didn't experience the zipper issue - there is a hook & eye at the top to keep the fabric together, and the zipper was stiff so it won't unzip of its own volition. it is a tad bulky at the top of the zipper w",5
"I recently purchased this tunic and love it! its not to big, hangs just right, arm holes are not to big and the material is very comfortable! looks great with white jeans, shorts, or just jeans. i will get a lot of wear all year round! fits true to size. oh, slimming too!",5
"I had been searching for an almost 50s style dress and i saw this one and instantly loved it. i wind up sending back so many things i get through retailer but this dress was everything i hoped it would be. i got the green one with the white dots. very comfortable, it just out a little with the hips because of the cut which is very 50s styling--it makes the waist look more narrow...",5
"This top is quite boxy and i was very disappointed with the color, it looked as if i'd washed it in filthy water. it's a very dingy white, needless to say it went back.",1
"This is a great dress! it's comfortable, easy care, and it looks fantastic. i love the bright green color, it's easy to wear alone, casually, or dressed up with cardigans or jackets. for my climate, this is a year-round piece. i can tone down the color and layer for cool seasons, and wear it alone in warm seasons.",5
This is a great dress; good quality fabric. the pattern & color are spot on. the silhouette is divine & would work on many body types. i also love the length!,5
This is my favorite top! i'm a 36d and usually wear a medium or large. i love this paired with skinny jeans or my level 99 blue shorts.,5
"I can see why the other reviewers think this top is huge in the waste - it's wide and not tailored at the waste ! the key to super cute fit is to size down - then it will look like it does on the model in the picture. i went with my regular medium and felt like i was wearing a giant moomoo, so i sized down and it immediately looked like it does on the model in the picture. it's super adorable in person, the collar and the polka dots make this playful yet very dressy and feminine and appropriate",5
"Love this top so much. it's very unique and one of those tops that's ""effortless"" to wear. i was expecting it to be boxy because of what other reviewers had written, but i find it to be flattering and comfortable. i'm glad i ordered the small because i do think the medium (my usual size) would have been too big.",5
Beautiful nightie- looks like its really well made and fits really well. i'm normally a size 6-8 and the m was perfect. definitely recommend.,5
"This fit perfectly. i am 5'7 , 138 pounds and ordered a small. i was very pleased with the way it draped over my body. i bought the black one.",5
"I love white shirts and can never have enough in my closet. this one is gorgeous, and is way prettier in person than it looks on the model. it has a peplum bottom with sort of (but not quite)appliquã©d large polka dots all over. it is a pullover, so there are no buttons on the peplum. i normally wear xl in retailer tops unless they run very large. i tried on the large in the store and it fit but i knew if it shrank when i washed it i'd never be able to wear it again. i ordered the xl which came tod",5
It is so beautiful and just as shown in the pictures! very elegant! i normally wear a small and it hung off me just a little.,5
"I have this top in the blue print and i love it. i'm super tempted to buy it in the black as well since i love it so much, but it might be a little pricy to have two of the same top. the only thing i will warn women about this top is that if you are busty then i would recommend going up a size. i wear a small in most retailer clothes but i went for a medium in this top. while the small did fit in al other areas, it looked like the buttons were going to pop at my bust.",5
"This top is adorable on. the online picture doesn't do it justice. a sales girl in my store had it on and i loved it and had to try it on. i got it in xs - black. i am 5'2"" and 115 lbs. it has the perfect drape to it. it might be too cool for winter but will be perfect when it warms up a little. this was my favorite thing i found in the store in months. love it.",5
"I took advantage of the promotional discount offered on this coat. i admired this soon as it appeared.  hesitant to purchase without any reviews, nor had opportunity to visit the store so i took a chance.  i love the pattern, burgundy wine faux fur collar, the fit. colors are true. i sized up which i recommend. glad i did, this will require thick sweater to provide any type of warmth if you are in a colder climate.  length mid-knee. imo not worth full price.  eleveness does design pretty coats!",5
"Fun , flirty, feminine!! love this blouse with jeans or with a skirt or leggings! i bought both blues i liked the first and after wearing it i ordered the navy with dots along with santuary black legging pants... just love !!!highly recommend. easy to wear.",5
"I saw this in the rockefeller store and picked it right up. i don't wear red so this shade or burgundy was more my color. the fit is perfect (sometimes buy a m at retailer but the small was perfect, which is what i'd wear at in most brands). i was slightly shocked it cost more than the other tops i bought, but it was too pretty to put back. wore with dark flare jeans to dinner that very night!",5
"I love the style of this jacket! 
i will be curious to see how it holds up in the rain.
it's very well made and has cute details.
it does run large.",5
"I love this romper so much! i'm a tall girl (5'9), so often times its hard for me to find a romper that isn't too short. the length on this is perfect. this romper is an adorable design and the fit is great. the material is a great quality, and its really comfortable! i'm 5'9 34b bra, i usually range between an xs and s, i went with the s on this one and it fits great! i definitely recommend this if you're thinking about it.",5
"I love love love this top. i love it so much i bought it in two different colors so i can wear it more often. i think it's feminine, chic, and classic. i've worn it several times and i each time i've had more than one person comment on it. i normally wear a small but they only had it in an extra small and i actually like how it fits which is why i think it runs a little large. the only place that it is a bit small is the cuffs at the end of the sleeves. i usually just unbutton those anyway so no",5
"I bought this in every color, and would probably keep buying it if there were others - the fit is loose yet flattering, quality is good, feminine pretty ruffles that don't add bulk, and i love that it makes me feel pretty and put-together post-baby.",5
"This romper is so cute and comfy! the fabric is soft and a beautiful shade of blue with light blue dots (true to the photos). i sometimes have issues with rompers due to my long torso, but this fits great, with shorts hitting about the same as the model image (i'm 5'7""). i really love the v-neck on this too - it's simple, but a really flattering cut that i don't think would expose even ladies with a larger chest. definitely a nice everyday piece - excited to wear it on a hot summer day at the pa",5
I absolutely love this top. i'm always either an x-small or 0/2 in mauve. i think this top runs small. i tried on an extra small and it was too tight in the chest. i'm average in bust.,5
"This romper has a great shape! you know that long saggy grandma butt that some rompers give you....this one is not that! it's cute and adorable and those long stitched pockets are so flattering to us short folk! i'm 5'4"" on a good day, 125#, 32g and this fits great. i picked up an xs (i'm never an xs) and it was very flattering. i'm usually a 4/27 in pants for reference. the v-neck and the way the shoulder seams start to angle in at the top make this very flattering. it is long enough for me to",5
Love this tunic. i bought it in black and wore it with skinny jeans and flat black boots and received many compliments. can be dressed up for work or worn with distressed jeans on the weekend.,5
"This top is not bmeant to be super fitted, it is flowy and ""romantic"". i have ordered the petite to decide which size to keep, but my usual xs was fine, wil ljsut compare length. i was also curious about hte smaller size, but didn't order it, so i wil lnever know.
the only color i saw in person is the black on, and it is calssic, so i went with it. shall wait for petite verdict!",5
"So i tried on the regular size in the store, and love the top, but looked too big on me.

color is gorgeous and rich, the sheer adds a little whimsical to it, and i love the tie-neck trend of lately. would go nicely with jeans (skinny or flare) or trousers, not sure about a skirt though,.",5
"Love this flowing, cute top! casual, but can be easily dressed up. great fit.",5
"I'm 5'7"", 130 lbs. i ordered a medium-regular. the dress fell three inches above my knees. this model is taller than i am, and it falls to her knees....doesn't make sense. i think retailer sends petites in place of regular.",1
"I ordered the navy in size xl and it fits me just as it does the model. this top is definitely one of my favorite retailer purchases. the cut is very flattering. i love how they designed the tunic to have a closer fit on top, the arms and through the top of the waist and then flow out. i'm a pear-shape and worried the bottom layer might accent my hips, but it all flows really nicely. the arms aren't tight. they're not loose but aren't too poofy.

the material washed well too, without static (a pro",5
"I bought this in blue/black. it is so pretty. i get so many compliments. i'm a size 4/6 but large busted. i bought this in a medium & it's perfect. just the right amount of fullness. i'm 5'4"" so the length for me is perfect w/leggings.",5
"I purchased this amazing tunic in-store in the plaid pattern, and couldn't be more thrilled with it. i can already see myself overwearing it, because it's so pretty and easy. i typically wear an xs, and sometimes petite styles. the regular small fits very well. i'm sure the xs would have been alright, but i like the way my forearms don't feel constricted where it buttons, and sizing up seemed to help with gaping by the button holes. i love the way this looks with a variety bottoms and shoes. it",5
"This garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it. i am probably between a small and xsmall, but ordered the xsmall. it is snug, but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath, just in case the buttons gap just a little. i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping. it is also a little snug in the elbow area.",5
"This is such a lovely blouse! the color is true to the picture. i am a bigger girl--5'9"" and size 12, and i bought the large. the fit was beautiful--it was forgiving on my less-than-perfect midsection, but wasn't billowy at all. it did not pull around the shoulders or bust the way some button-up blouses do.",5
This top is perfect! very comfortable and flattering for any body type.,5
This tunic is beautiful! the color is a vibrant blue. i can wear it with jeans or dress it up with my white linen capris! i ordered the small and it fits me perfectly!!!,5
Love this top!! so comfy and flattering. i ordered the black and the blue and i am itching to get the red/purple one too!,5
I tried this in the store and i liked it. the color is very pretty and the fabric is soft and drapey and feels like good quality. i like the little subtle dots. i ultimately did not buy it because the tie at the throat is not my style and because i just don't need this kind of piece enough in my wardrobe at the moment. but it is a very nice top and i would recommend it if you like the color and style.,5
After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,1
"Bought this shirt in the colorful polka dot print and i'm obsessed! like previous reviews mentioned, it runs a little small in the chest. i'm normally a medium but am a 36c so ordered the large and it fits perfect! with the way the buttons are spaced i think all sizes will pull a little no matter what. it's a beautiful shirt and i plan on ordering the blue one as well.",5
"This dress hits flatters the whole body. love the three quarter sleeves, love the relaxed fit of the bottom half. love how it is fitted, body conscious around bust. super flattering. the teal color is particularly gorgeous. a color that would suit a lot of different skin tones. this is a no-brainer dress that you will reach for in your closet every single time.",5
"I've got the post-baby bulge and this dress makes me the hottest i've looked in a long time! fitted, but skimming where i don't want to be accentuated - it's a rare dress that can pull this off! the cleavage is there, so i think it's more of a night dress, but i'd wear it with a sweater during the day. very comfortable.",5
I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this in m in two colors because i love it so much! the fit is so flattering and the material is so soft and comfortable. i continue to get the best quality and fitting dresses from retailer!,5
"Saw this on line and decided to ""splurge"" for the holidays. arrived today and is going right back. runs very small especially in the waist. trim is a cheap ribbed fabric with a zipper. fabric is not elegant looking as in the picture, appears cheap and very itchy. sooooo disappointed.",1
"I bought this top in the black motif and it is easily one of my new go to tops. can wear it to brunch, work, and happy hours, it always looks good! such a great buy.",5
"This is one of the best things i have ever bought from anrtho. it is very flattering, and i always get compliments when i wear it. must have!",5
I recently bought this top in both the black and blue motifs and love it! i'm currently 7 months pregnant and this top provides great coverage for the bump. i agree with another reviewer that noted that it is a little tight in the bust as i had to go up a size for that reason.,5
"This is the rare metallic that doesn&#39;t itch - really well made (italy) - lightweight - it&#39;s a total go!

i usually wear a large - but i bought a medium (i tried it on in the dressing room - i  think it looks better &#39;fit&#39; than oversized preppy - i wear a 38b bra / size 12",5
"Hands down, my new favorite top! love the look of this top! i would say this runs a little big. i definitely could have sized down. however, the flowy style of my usual retailer size works for me in this piece.",5
I got this dress to wear for christmas and it is perfect. looks great and is very comfy. low cut in front and back that is not too revealing and allows for perfect bra coverages. i got it in a small small.,5
Extremely soft and comfortable. fit very well. should travel really well.,5
"I love this top so much. i dare say it is one of my favorite retailer purchases to date. i got it in the blue and it is really magical! i get compliments every time i wear it. i have a pair of dressier black leggings that i never know what to wear with, i'm not really a leggings person. but this tunic is exactly the piece! plus, this tunic comes with pockets. what's better than that??!",5
"I hate buying dresses because i rarely find one that fits well. i'm very petite on top (xsmall) and small/med on bottom, 5'8"". usually dresses are tight on my hips & thighs and loose up top. this fairly lightweight yet warm dress is such a winner! form-fitting yet stretchy and forgiving in all the right places. the x-small and small both fit pretty well but i decided to go with the x-small on this one. i think this will be a staple winter/fall dress. loved the fit so much i bought it in the peac",5
This is the perfect jacket to throw on for errands around town. picture doesn't do it justice...very unique and stylish. love the three-quarter sleeves for this time of year.,5
"This is a great piece, which has flow, grace, and charm. the blue is a beautiful color! i love it and received numerous complements after wearing it one time.",5
Looks professional but wears like a sweater! so comfy!,5
This dress is comfortable and a great go to dress to wear to work and then after for drinks with friends.,5
"I love this tunic, super flattering + long enough (if your no super tall like me) to wear with leggings! it does run a little big, i like tops a little looser on me so i didn't mind that. i ordered a small- if your typically a small and prefer more fitted tops i would suggest sizing down. 

i bought the blue tunic first (the pictures don't do the textile design justice!) i loved it so much i went back online and purchased this tunic in black!!!

thanks retailer for being awesome!",5
"I purchased this top in the black color and absolutely love it! it is very fun and can be either dressed up or down. i would wear this to work as well as out and about around town. it is worn loose, so i ordered a size down. i cannot wait to wear it through spring and summer!",5
"I ordered this in the navy and the red/blue plaid. fit- i'm usually a 10 m. after reading reviews, i ordered a l and it was the right choice. it's silky and covers up my postpartum middle nicely. i was worried the pleats would accentuate that part of me, but it does not at all. print- love the plaid. not sure about the navy with diff color dots. that one is probably going back.",5
"While this shirt does run a little large, i am 5' 0"" and ordered a petite small, it is perfect for layering under a loose cardigan. can be dressed up or down- looking forward to wearing it this summer!",5
"I'm always thrilled to find a piece like this at retailer - just received my dress and couldn't be happier! beautifully made and fits absolutely perfectly. i'm 5'5"" 118 lbs. and am very comfortable in the small (with a little breathing room). length is perfect with heels. planning to wear it with sandals to a birthday party this month and then into fall and winter with boots and a top layer. if you're hesitating, go for it!",5
"I love how comfortable this dress is, it does run a little large so i would order a size down. i'm 5'3"" and around 125lbs and had to exchange the xsp for an xxsp.",5
"I agree a few others, it may be a little bit boxy but i don't even care because it's so beautiful! definitely a top i'm going to love long after this floral craze the fashion world is in begins to fade.",5
"First off, the moment i put on, i got tons of compliments from complete strangers. it truly is a unique and pretty. i am 5'3 and originally wanted the med petite for length. they were sold out so i got the xs in the regular size. that worked out good. it is a bit snug around the shoulders but not enough to go up a size. overall, xs was a good alternative to medium petite.",5
"I'm so happy i purchased this cardigan!! every time i've worn it i've actually gotten compliments, from both women and men:) i was slightly undecided at first due to it's quite pricey, but i think the quality is amazing and the pattern will actually last a long time as a keeper, not just a quick trend!! i'm so happy i snagged it before it ran out!!\ i have quite muscular upper arms, and the medium fits me well. the sleeves do have some give in them, and even though i'm also broad across my shoul",5
"This was a winner retailer!!!!! bought it with my birthday discount. a bit pricey, but when i wore it (over and over again) i can see why. the material is so soft, flows beautifully and is just the right length on me. i am petite (5'3"") slender at 115 and i wear it with wedge heels, just like the model. i did iron it when i took it out of the package but have not had to iron it again.

i have received many compliments on this dress. bought the washed denim look.

thank you!!!!",5
"I got this in peach, and am not ashamed to say that i wore it almost every day in the past week - over a tee, over a dress, over a tunic...it looks good with everything! my normal size s is on the looser side compared to my other retailer bombers, but i like it for layering purposes. so soft and comfy...i have a feeling i'm going to need a backup of this one!",5
"This tunic fits exactly as shown and is so comfortable. the fabric is soft and buttery, and the lace up front is a awesome detail. happy that i went with the non-denim color because it's a gorgeous rich color that i think will transition well from season to season. love a good, cutr machine-washable tunic!",5
"This is a very ""retailer "" piece. i love it! i wish retailer would bring back more pieces like this! anyway, the details on this sweater are so special! the sweater is sturdier and warmer than i thought it would be which is a plus. i love the drape it has to it down the front. one slight dislike is that the shoulders seem a little tight in my usual small. but, considering this sweater is completely sold out i will make it work! love it!",5
"The pictures of this blouse simply don't do it justice. the floral details are gorgeous. i liked it when i ordered it, but loved it on. i am 5'5"", 135lbs, curvy/athletic frame, ordered the size 4 and it fit perfectly.",5
I was hesitant to order this but i am really glad i did. it is just beautiful. the quality is excellent. i would like it to have more snaps so i am going to add them. i can't wait to wear it.,5
I adore this sweater....  so happy that i was able to get one.  get random compliments from strangers all the time!,5
"First saw this jacket in the catalog, in peach, and had to have it. i received it today, and love it. its a soft, muted peach, very neutral. i ordered xl, im usually a m-l, but decided i wanted it to look big and comfy. the quality is great, feels good on. love it so much, i just ordered it in the dark grey. very classic jacket, will wear for years. one of my favorite hei hei pieces, never disappoints.",5
"I love this top. in fact, when i saw in the store, i was hoping that it would go on sale. i wore it and received many compliments. the underlay provide adequate coverage so no additional cami is needed. this top does run large. i normally wear a 2 and i ordered this in a 0 and it fits perfectly. i would not order this if you are not willing to spend the money to dry clean it. it is delicate and i would not encourage washing it at home.",5
"This screams the old school classic retailer that we all love. it was one of my rare full price purchases because it's just perfection! i'm 5'4, 112lbs and normally and xs. however, when i tried on an xs is store i felt that it sort of swallowed me up. i went ahead and ordered an xs petite even though i rarely go with petites, but it fits perfectly. it doesn't leave room for layering, but i live in socal, so i don't need to layer often.",5
"The pattern is actually knitted into the fabric instead of just printed on like i've sometimes found; the embroidery mostly serves as a highlighting feature instead of a focus. the inside of the cardigan is another layer of fabric, sort of like a double knit? but with its own, simple striped pattern. the collar looks like it might be itchy, but it only is until it gets stretched out a bit and arranged properly.",5
"I'm 60+, in relatively decent shape, 135 lbs, and size 6 is perfect. i went for the regular rather than petite sizing, which came well below my knees, and although i would usually have a sheath dress like this hemmed up to that slim part right at the bottom of the knee, the slim silhouette shape served to lengthen the profile as a longer dress, so i left it about 3"" below the knee. the stretch allows it to hug the body, and with the right undergarments, it is super comfortable and attractive. go",5
"This sweater is so lovely.. i like the fact that it's not super heavy, so you can be comfortable with a layer under it. the embroidery is beautiful. i usually get petite sizes when available, but the petite m was sold out when i purchased. i went with regular medium and am actually glad. it's not overwhelming or too long (i'm 5'2"").. in my opinion. if you're on the fence, go for it. totally worth it..",5
Love this jacket.  it is quite stylish and comfortable at the same time.  i was surprised at how affordable it was.  my only complaint is that it could wash you out if you have pale skin and get the peach color.,5
"And this one has a heavenly feel to it. i know it's not 100% cashmere, but it's soft and cozy. i love the understated colors and plan to wear it with a neutral/creme sweater. perfect to take from fall into winter.",5
"I bought this dress for a trip to the caribbean and really enjoyed wearing it.
i was worried it might look like a ""sack"" but i think it is both slimming and flattering. i love the interesting neckline and rolled up sleeves!! a winner.",5
This is very unique and stylish! the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable. it is pretty warm. it does not itch me at all as others have noted.,5
"Just purchased this sweater in store as a christmas present for my self and i'm in love! i feel the fit besides the shoulders which are somewhat narrow, is perfect. i usually wear a petite medium in everything but had to go with the regular small because they didn't have petites in the store. i tried on the regular medium and it was just slightly too big everywhere. overall i am so pleased with this purchase. so happy i popped into retailer today and saw it!",5
"When i first saw this in the retailer catalog, i thought it was beautiful. i am a sucker for floral prints, and unique color combinations, both of which this top has. i'm 5'3"", 120 lbs and a small bust at 32b, i usually wear a size 2 but it was a little loose all around so i'd say it runs big. they had the size 2 at a low sale price in my local store so i bought it without hesitation. it's a little loose but very flattering and very good quality, i definitely recommend it if your shape is s",5
I saw this online and just had to have it! it fits and looks exactly as pictured. excellent for spring or fall.,5
This bomber really is superb. it's everything you could want in a jacket. beautiful color that goes with so much (i got the pink) and is so trendy this fall. i am 5'4 and smaller on top so i purchased the small. i didn't want it too baggy but i probably could've sized up to a medium too.,5
"I love this shirt! i wore it to a friend's baby shower and received a lot of compliments on it. the neckline and shoulders and very flattering, but then i'm not very busty, so maybe that's why it worked for me. the material is hand-wash only, but well worth it for such a unique, pretty top. i also didn't get any weird smell from this shirt nor did i think the material was too stiff.",5
"I recently purchased this jacket online in the rose color and it is beautiful! i usually wear an xs in retailer but purchased this in size s after trying on the grey color at the store. there was no xs to try for comparison but the s fit well and leaves room for light layers underneath. the only reason i rated it as ""runs small"" is that xs is my usual size so this may be true to size for most. i also wanted the option of zipping with layers underneath. the sleeves are long but can be rolled",5
"This sweater does have a matching tie belt. it is detached, no belt loops. i'm guessing the previous reviewer accidentally threw it away with packing material. i loved this sweater on line. i could not bring myself to order it at full price. with tax it would have cost over $200, seemed too pricey for a sweater. when it was marked down to $99 with free shipping i couldn't hit buy fast enough. i was afraid it would sell out before i got through check out. my disappointment was the color. it is fa",5
"Cool, comfortable, goes with everything! i found both colors at my local antro today!! almost ordered the grey online because that's all that was available, but decided to check my store first. so glad i did. the peach is so pretty, and looks really good with my blond hair. the grey looked much more like a faded black, darker than pictured online, imo. i would have still purchased it in grey if that's all they had, because it is such a great piece, but the peach really is lovely. i'm 5'10"" 145 p",5
I bought this dress to wear to a funeral. i usually wear a medium but when i tried it on it was way too big so i exchanged it for a small which fit perfectly! the side slits make the dress a bit sexy and the styling is boxy but very comfortable especially with the pockets! the fabric lies beautifully on the body. i would recommend this dress.,5
"This dress is perfect for anyone with an hour glass shape,it is true to size, i am 5'3 and 125b the 2 petite fit perfectly. the fabric has a little give to it so if you have hips and a chest it will stretch a little without feeling tight and dress sinches in the waist creating a beautiful silhouette. it's the structure of this dress that makes it elegant and sexy. this dress is so figure flattering, i could not believe how many complements i've received on it.",5
"This shirt is so soft and buttery! it fits tts and just as shown on the model. for the sale price, this shirt is a gonga! good go-to shirt on those days where you're just not sure what to wear. one thing that slightly bothers me about this shirt is that the arm holes are a bit loose, so you can see your bra. i think if you wear a black bra with it though, it would be fine.",5
"This jacket is just too small for me anyway and i am no way big. i am tall and athletic and this thing looked like it had shrunk in the wash. there are so many better fitting other types out there, this went back",1
"I love this dress, it's the right length and its very soft and comfortable. it is not really denim, just a soft grey material. i tried on the blue one in the store before ordering the grey and found that the small fit better than the medium - i'm typically a medium. usually in this brand i have to size up but in this case i sized down :-)

i highly recommend this dress is you are looking for a simple shift dress that you can just throw on and go.",5
I love this jacket! it is super soft and a gorgeous color. i can wear it with jeans and a tee or dress it up and wear it to work. so versatile! a must have for the fall season!,5
Would buy this again in a heartbeat. so comfortable and fit is great. color will look good with jeans or a dress. bought it for a cruise in the spring and it is perfect!,5
"This skirt fits me like a glove, you must get the matching top and orange jacket that makes the whole outfit high
fashion fun chic. i am 5' 8"" and 145 full figured and imlove this out fit. very cozy too.",5
"Birthday gift from my husband, and i have it hanging up where i can see it, the design is like a huge beautiful tapestry. although it looks heavy, the cotton has a nice feel to it. hand-embroidered here and there. i usually wear size s/m and the med. is very comfortable. gorgeous!",5
"Love this jacket! saw it in the store and waited a few days before breaking down and buying it in the peach color. glad i did as it sold out super fast. it's soft, flattering, versatile, and has great detail in the stitching. perfect layer for fall. i'm usually a large, sometimes medium in hei hei jackets and the large fit very comfortably with room for light layers underneath. the style is a little boxy and slouchy but the fit in the shoulders and elastic ribbed waistband give it a flattering f",5
"I love this jacket. the color is what drew me to it and it looks just like the picture. as far as sizing goes, i'm usually a medium but i ordered a small and it fit well. i feel that if i had ordered a medium it would look a little too puffy for my taste. the small gives me a more fitted look.",5
"Wow... i'm in love!!! when i first saw this i put it in my cart... when i went back to purchase it, it was sold out in my size... i was so bummed. i kept checking back and saw it was restocked so i quickly ordered it... thank heavens!!! when i first took it out of the box i thought it might be too ""grandma-y"" of a design... but i was wrong. it's just gorgeous! can totally be dressed up or down. so flattering. love love love it!!!",5
"I absolutely love this jacket. as a 36 year old woman, i want items that are on trend but don't look juvenile. this jacket hits the nail on the head for me.",5
"Great jacket for night time in the south this time of year ... very nice fabric, great classic style with a little twist... love retailerplogy ... being an older female, sometimes things can look boring ....i love to dress in fun clothes ... finding something that will work for all ages and that is a ""little out side the lines "" is very nice!!!!",5
"Woke up this morning to an email from retailer showcasing this gorgeous jacket. i knew i had to have it. trying it on in the store, it did not disappoint! hei hei is a really wonderful brand, and me being a more plus sized gal, their sizing is always wonderful. i normally do an xl in most retailer jackets and tops,..but i was able to do a l well. the arms have plenty of room and the body of the jacket has a room as well (like your typical bomber would). the fabric is soft and the blush color",5
"Lovely dress. i was a bit hesitant as a reviewer mentioned the fabric being irritable but luckily i had no issues. the regular is long and i have to wear it with my wedge, but i'm ok with that.",5
"It's no surprise that this sweater coat is getting five stars. it's beautifully made, has a fun pattern, and fits great.

i purchased the xs (regular size). there weren't any of the petite sizes left for me but the xs fits perfectly. the sleeves hit at my wrist (i'm 5'2"") while the length hits right at the top of my knees. i did notice that the shoulder width could be too tight if you are a more broad person.

the colors are accurate to the website and catalog. this seems so extremely versatile",5
"I usually wear a medium, and this jacket was no exception. the jacket is a shorter style as pictured. it is still flattering, even though it is a little boxy. i got the grey, which is a dark gray/slight greige color. if you like edgier over boho, this is a cute transitional jacket.",5
"These jeans have definitely made me an ag convert. the fit is perfection and at 5'3"", it is so to buy jeans and simply wear them (without the typical extra 4-6"" of length).",5
Super cute jacket .perfect for fall i can't stop wearing it,5
"This. this you have to buy! i just tried it on in our new store the other night and am in love. gorgeous details went into the sweater coat. it's thinner than most, which is nice when you want to look lovely but don't quite need to bundle up! i plan on purchasing after christmas if it's still around!",5
"I bought this jacket in the gray and couldn't be happier with it. it is loose fitting but not oversized. it will look great over a dress with boots, or with jeans. very versatile piece.",5
"I don't own any peach outerwear because i didn't think it would complement my skintone. this cozy bomber proved me wrong. wonderful quilting pattern and a vintage dye job that's eye catching. great for layering and the color goes with my autumn and spring wardrobe. this is not a fitted style, it's relaxed and a bit poufy at the sleeves and waist, just like a regular bomber jacket. i chose medium petite and it fits just right. i'm a 36d, 135#, 38-28-35.",5
"Delayed for a month on back order, this dress was worth the wait!  the beautiful design and colors are just as shown in the pictures.  the length and cut is slimming, more fitted at the bodice with a subtle flare after the waist.  detachable liner dress is a stetchy tank top that goes to the knees.  pullover style with a closed-end side zip that's needed because the knit band design under the bust does not stretch at all.  


if your skin is sensitive--this dress isn't for you.  both the line",5
"Wish they had more colors in these pants. the dark grey is very nice, but i'd definitely take another color if offered. very cute pants. a fantastic deal at the sale price. but size down! they run a full size too big.",5
"The sweater and skirt are so pretty! they're really soft and have such an easy, comfortable look together. really love this gorgeous outfit.

i am borderline small/medium and kept the size small after trying both on.",5
This picture doesn't do the skirt justice. i paired it with a creme colored cashmere cowlneck sweater and a silver jeweled belt. it is really pretty and flattering on.,5
"Ordered it in small regular and xtra small petite. what was surprising was that the xtra small petite fit better (meaning more room) across the chest. i'm normally a medium or medium petite, but this runs large. if you're unsure of a size, get both and return the one that doesn't fit as well. it's much better in person and looks very rich in colors and quality. the only complaint i have is there were some loose yarn pieces just dangling off the edges. i trimmed up with scissors and they didn't e",5
"Love this dress! it can be dressed up or down and its very comfortable. i got the ps, but could have probably fit into a pxs since the style is rather loose.",5
"Great sweater to brighten those gloomy winter days. this is a beautiful sweater, soft, colorful. perfect.",5
"I tried this dress at the store and fell in love with it but they only had the red dress (my size). trust me, the red is absolutely beautiful but i needed a black dress so i purchased it online. i just can't wait for it to arrive!
it fits perfectly and it's so classy.",5
Love the jacket! so versatile! would probably order up a size if you like a loose fit.,1
"I just received this sweater last week and love it. the material is so much softer and lighter than i expected, but plenty warm. the neck is slightly itchy, but not bad at all. i wore this sweater to church over a navy dress on sunday and received tons of compliments. it is such a unique piece.",5
"Love,love, love this. it is so different and unique. definitely not something you will see in any other store. wore it last week and have never received so many compliments on one piece. so retailer!!!!!! it was very warm and comfortable. i did wear a turtleneck under this, because of reviews of itching. i did not have any problems.",5
"Loved this from the minute i saw it in an email. i got the blue grey in a medium. i'm 5'4"", 140. it's a little roomy but will be nice over sweaters too. i love the cropped length. really well made.",5
This skirt is so soft and warm! looks gorgeous with middi boots or ankle boots. colors are beautiful and the length is perfect to take you into spring!,5
This dress is amazing! i have a b cup and didn't quite fill out the top enough. but that is a small tailoring fix. i am completly in love with this dress and recommend it highly,5
"Aesthetically pleasing and very well-made. love it! but, does run large.",5
"Absolutely stunning top! love! what a great buy on sale! i wear a medium/large and purchased the size 12...fits perfect! beware that the bottom has somewhat of a flair! the material is light so i would say this top is something to be worn transitioning between seasons, late summer to fall!",5
"I can't wait to wear this,but it has been to hot in the south.you can wear this so many ways.the material is wonderful, and the pattern better in person.",5
"This piece is a great, easy throw on that allows you to still look polished. it's heavy weight is a perfect substitute for a coat on those in-between fall weather days when you don't want to lug a jacket around. lining is super soft and makes it so comfortable to wear.",5
"Bought this in navy - going to buy another one in a different color!  it fits my curves beautifully!  does not look ""boxy"" like other tunic sweaters.  i also disagree with other reviews, i cannot see through it.",5
Loved this online and even better in person. inner lining is like a cozy sweatshirt!,5
"This sweater is super flattering. love the cowl neck and longer length. it is not boxy or shapeless, but manages to show off your figure without clinging anywhere. i did not find any of the colors to be see through as some other reviewers had noted.  i purchased the navy and think i'll go back for the brown as well!  size down if between sizes.  i am 5'7"" and busty, and the medium fit great.",5
"This top looked positively vulgar on!!!! i am a 34d, and it was way too low cut...my boobs were spilling out!!! in addition, the fabric reminded me of a cheese cloth.....it just looked and felt cheap. unfortunately, this top will be going back.",1
"I kept stalking this cape on the site since it went on a few months ago and finally decided to pull the trigger. this is an absolutely gorgeous cape.perfect for hourglass figures because of the waist-defining belt. its a really modern cut - it reminds me of some of the red carpet cape dresses of late. its so elegant - this is a timeless cut. the nude is a gorgeous, rich warm brown color. if you're really busty, you might go up a size to get the girls covered. i ordered my usual size m, and i may",5
"I ordered this top from store. i'm 5'3"" and 114 lbs, i ordered size 4, fir very nice, just front is little to low for me, but i wear ten top , it will be fine. the style and material are amazing, love it!",5
"I have been admiring this piece for awhile and finally decided to purchase it, and i am so happy i did! the yellow is the perfect pop of color for fall/winter, but it isn't overwhelming or overpowering. fit is oversized (as is in any poncho style sweater) but it doesn't feel boxy or unflattering. if in between sizes, definitely go down. i like things oversized and i went with the xs/s and it fits great. this will be a go to piece for many years to come!",5
"Absolutely lovely! even better in real life. this is not your typical cheap, flimsy dress. this is quality! the fabric is interesting, the color is gorgeous and the styling is flattering. pay attention to the length ? there are miles of fabric in that fortuny-esque skirt and the model is very tall. i am 5'5"" and slim, and ordered petite small, and it's a little longer on me than it is on the model. i don't mind. i've been looking for a special-occasion dress for a long time and knew this was it",5
"Walked into the retailer store in new york, while on vacation, and saw this on display. had to try it on immediately and loved the look. received several compliments from customers in the store. it's beautifully made, soft on the inside and makes a great statement piece that i will enjoy for years to come!! you will need to size down cause it runs large. i love it............",5
"I love this sweater. i ordered the xs because i have very narrow hips and i didn't want it to be too baggy. it fits a little like a very short sweater dress on me. what i really love is that the arms are nice and long. one of my pet peeves is sweaters that are compromised in arm length. 
i bought the pink and plan to get at least one other color too!",5
"I loved this sweater! it is a little thin, so i will probably wear a tank under it, but you could probably get away without one, i am normally either an xs or a small, and i got the xs in this sweater. the bottom is a little loose like in the models photo, but i really like it.",5
The material this top is made of is extremely comfortable and flattering for my body type.  i normally wear 12/14 and 12 fit great (if you have a d or bigger you may need a bigger size) spillage is possible with wrong size lol.,5
"This cape/poncho item is totally amazing. from the moment it whispered over my head as it slipped past my hair, i knew i had to have it. this piece is magical. it feels like you're wearing a blanket (the warmth factor), but the length is so perfect that it doesn't overwhelm you, nor does it make you look like a tank. the colors are amazingly saturated and the quality is so worth the price. the model is wearing it with light brown, but i tried it on over black leggings in the store and it works w",5
This dress is a beautiful color and is so lightweight and flowing. will be perfect for a fall wedding that i am attending. it is supposed to be loose so i think it is relatively true to size if not just a bit on the large side. will look great with a kimono or other wrap when the weather is a bit chilly.,5
I am so surprised this was not styled properly in the photo! if worn the way it should be worn it would have sold out before going on sale. yes it is open down each side but you need to slide a belt inside the back so the back is left full and bring the belt out into the front on sides cinching in the front...making this a dramaticly gorgeous piece! i love it and will wear it with my leather jeans to pencil skirt. i am a personal stylist and designer and if you are thinking about this piece jump,5
"I bought the white in my usual xs size, i don't agree with some of the other reviews that say it is thin, because it is not a sweater. it is a pullover in a kind of waffle weave fabric , not a sweater knit. very cute with a flattering fit. casual wear.",5
I wore it belted with a close fitting cami beneath because the sweater is open down both sides. be creative and wear it different ways.,5
"I disagree with the other review. i purchased the xxsp in navy and i think the sweater fits true to what is shown on the retailer-model. the sweater knit is lighter weight, it is not heavy. it fits more tightly to the body, which i like. the material is soft to me and navy color has a gray-tone to it. i did not find it difficult to wear the sweater off of the shoulders at all. if you are looking for a heavier sweater this is not for you. if you do not want a body skimming sweater this is not for y",5
"I bought this on a whim, and i love it. the colors are much brighter than the photo would indicate. it's definitely a poncho - oversize is the name of the game - but it's cozy, gorgeous and i wish i could wear it every day.",5
"This is a beautiful skirt and such a great piece to collect from erin fetherston.

the design and cut are very flattering on a variety of body types. i have more of a curvy shape and love this type of cut to accentuate my smaller waste (rather than fitted dresses/skirts that hug).

there are several linings that help give shape and volume. the stripes are made of ribbon. it's so gorgeous, i've received many compliments. i've paired with a sequin tank and glitter keds by kate spade...it's a dynam",5
"This skirt is going to be perfect for the hot texas summers. super lightweight and floaty, and the pattern is so gorgeous. will go great with my favorite purple shoes!",5
"Ordered on line and thought these are a great quality as i pulled them out of the box. tried them on and found minimal elastic for the waist. within minutes of wearing, the waist fell down past my hips...glad i was at home. looks cute but will not stay up.",1
"I absolutely love slips, and i like the grey tone of this one-and that it is not super shiny. it adds to the versatility of the slip-which i wear many ways. i wear them as under layers for long cardigans, i wear them as a real traditional slip under other dresses, and i also have been known to wear them to bed. the fabric on this one is absolutely comfortable and lightweight. i like that the fabric is cut in a babydoll format and the straps are wider (an a different color) which adds just enough",5
What a classy special top. really dresses up a pair of black slacks. i actually think this is a perfect spring piece!,5
"I wanted to love these, they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity. i'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store.",1
"Good fit, quality, similar to the brand's other jeans.",5
"This sweater was just what i was looking for.  it is so soft & comfortable.  the design is unique and delicate, yet doesn't shed or itch.  the decorations are not as pure white as pictured, there are several different tones of ivories & creams.  i ordered the xs, which is my typical size in retailer sweaters, as i find that most run very large and this is no exception.  it is oversize, but not bulky.  however, the decorations do add some volume, so maybe not for all body types.",5
"Noce color as well, only gave one less star due to thin you could see my bra quality (it was pink and i tried on the grey). otherwise, nice and soft. regular size a little long and long sleeves, but sold out n petite :-(",5
This is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow. this sweater's knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky. wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments.,5
"Classic retailer piece that i am so happy to have in my wardrobe. high quality all wool felt jacket. unlined, stretchy comfortable knit. i wear mine as a knit blazer and love it. it is not merino soft, but soft enough to wear over a long sleeve tee. the neck does not itch. 

fits tts, i wear a l and that is my normal retailer size. i am tempted to get the cream as well!",5
"Kicky little pleat in the back is interesting and comfortable. great fit, good colors and doesn't wrinkle easily.",5
"This dress was exactly what i was looking for- a rich, luxurious fabric, a deep neckline, and a tightly cinched waist. i have a full bust and, while the snug waistband was a negative for some reviewers, for me it is a little miracle. this dress fit like a glove and was flattering in my usual size. thank you!",5
"These pants are so cute and flattering. the linen is substantial and the quality of the tailoring is very good. i typically wear a 26p, but they were sold out in the gray color, so i tried the 25p and they fit perfectly. this tells me that they run just a little big, at least in the petite sizing. i wish the rose color was available in petite. i am considering ordering the chocolate as well.",5
"#childsize. not sure where this went wrong but it's going back immediately. always wear a 0-2 in retailerpologist skirts, this size 0 runs at least two sizes too small. the material is beautiful, but if i got the size i needed i would be entirely swallowed by fabric. so disappointing.",1
A great addition to any wardrobe. can go with nice trousers and dressier shoes for work or jeans and trainers for a casual look. i didn't find it to run small and indeed thought it fit as i'd expect.,5
These pants are great. the pattern is beautiful and the fit is perfect. they pair well with a s front tucked shirt or fitted colwyn neck sweater. another great find from retailer!,5
"I loved the look of these pants in the pictures online and i loved the way that they fit. however when i got my pair, the flower placement was completely different. the whole front was black and there were just flowers running out of the crotch seams. i ordered another pair hoping they were just cut wrong, but those were even worse. they looked obscene.",1
Gorgeous!! get these while you can. tts. has a lot of stretch. these are so much fun and will sell out! so happy!,5
"I love this slip.. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer. the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top. it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without. i am 5'3, 32c and the xs fits perfectly! also i think it looks better in person.",5
"Loved the chocolate ones so much, i went back for the rose. my first thought when i tried them on was, ""i could live in these!"" honestly a very comfortable pant.",5
"I have quite a few pairs of retailer pants and jeans. my favorites are the cords i got last year, similar to these, so when i saw this fun pair, i had to have them. i ordered both the 32 and the 33 to try on.

they are even more beautiful in person than online. and they are so, so small. it wasn't like they were a tad snug--i couldn't even get the button across to meet the buttonhole. on the 33.

i've never had a problem fitting into retailer pants before. this was an extra-depressing first time",1
"I purchased this skirt on a whim as an option for the up and coming hoiday party season and was plesantly surprised. it is very well made,a medium weight taffita material, and best of all, it has pockets! i just love the combination of colors in the skirt; navy blue, grey, and ecru stripe. i paired the skirt with a taylored white dress shirt and statement necklace for a classic look but also imagine it combined with a dressy t-shirt cut as well. buy it while you can!",5
"I love this top. i got it thinking i'd wear it mostly with jeans but turns out i have worn it with a lot more. it pairs great with cut-off shorts, white jeans, denim jeans. i have worn it tucked in with high waisted jeans for a more polished look and also un-tucked for a more casual look. i get lots of compliments on this top when i wear it. i think it could be worn into fall with a jacket over it. very happy with it!",5
This top is a great addition to your summer wardrobe! it looks great with jeans/jean shorts. it's relaxed and comfortable with a super flattering cut. the straps and low cut in the back add a touch of sexy as well.,5
"A truly unwearable slip: scratchy fabric, bunchy skirt, teeny bodice. it feels like you are wearing wrapping paper--the foil kind.",1
"I tried these on in store and purchased them in the chocolate brown as the fit was perfect! i am 5' 8"" and weigh 145 pounds with an approximate 10"" difference between hips and waist. the size 27 fit perfectly. i was surprised that they did not wrinkle terribly as they are linen. they withstood wear during a very active day and still looked great by evening. they wash well and only needed a quick touch up with the iron. i liked them so well that i ordered a second pair in grey!",5
"So wanted great pair of sweater leggings...great for running errands and keeping the outfit simple. these are not that. these fit very poorly...i ordered the small, which is more like a large one in the waistline...there is nothing to hold these up and i could fit two of me in them. unfortunately, i thought all would be fine and i discarded the receipt and have worn them a few times~",1
"I am so sad i have to return these leggings. they're adorable--so much so that my fiancã© commented favorably on them--but as other reviewers have pointed out, there's no elastic or string in the waistband so you have to walk around holding them up with one hand or they'll fall down! why, sleeping on snow? whyyyyyyyyyyy? they're so great otherwise!",1
I love these pants - they are very soft but the linen is thick and high-quality.,5
"This is a beautifully designed jacket that everyone will love and won't want to take off! i went with the gray wool. i always worry about jackets that are too snug, as i am busty, but this fit is superb. the arms are unusually long (though maybe this is good for you). i had a dressmaker shorten my sleeves by one inch, so now it's perfect for me. i bought the regular medium, my usual size (size 8 or medium top, 34f). i tend to wear my blazers and jackets open, but it's nice to know that i can but",5
"This sweater is gorgeous - the colors are beautiful and the piece itself is soft. i do think it is a bit shorter than i would prefer, and i tend to wear petites. the sweater is nice enough that i do not mind!",5
"Warm and cozy tights for my daughter, she loves them!",5
I love this unique shirt!  the only thing is is is really wide like a babydoll top fit.  i tucked mine into skinny jeans,5
"I ordered the xx petite on this one, and unlike last year's version of a similar sweater, this one is a bit longer and looser. last year, i kept the xs p, but it was shorter too. the fit is loose, not snug or form-fitting, even as the smallest size available, it was loose but not large or unflattering. the length was also appropriate. love the colors, and pattern too. the material is soft, and the button detail in the back is fun. i am 30dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs, for reference.",5
"I felt like this shirt cut me in the strangest way. the waistband is very fitted, but there is so much extra fabric above and below it that it poofs out like crazy and made me look like a had a droopy chest and wider hips. it's also see through. 

fit is tts.",1
Love everything about this sweater. i usually wear xs in most retailer tops but had to exchange for a s. hope this helps!,5
"This is my favorite top! it is gorgeous, soft, & oh so comfortable. it's not too tight & works with leggings, jeans, or as an over-shirt. love it!",5
"This sweater came in just as expected . . . adorable. as others have said, it is soft and comfy. i will wear it everywhere (including work). i love it! :)",5
This shirt looks nothing like the fit in the pictures. it is short and very wide. i had read the previous reviews and thought i could take it in on the sides some but it is literally the shape of a trapezoid.,1
"The liatris floral top is a comfy sweater knit with floral accents on the front and sleeves. the back has a row of buttons though the top easily slips on over one's head. it contains wool but is not in the least itchy. in fact it has a silky feel to it in its finely knitted fabric . it would be cute with a patterned bottom, like a plaid or dotted pants as shown. doesn't seem to be easy to snag.",5
I ordered this in a petite online and i usually wear petites.  it isn't see thru in a way that shows a lot and i love the light weight fabric.  i get a lot of compliments on it.,5
"I love this. it is perfect. it is sheer, but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great. so glad antro finally has something with a waist! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail. i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one!",5
"This blouse is a disappointment! it runs so large, it looks ridiculous. the cute is super wide and flared. they must have it pinned on the model. it is not flattering at all. i really thought this could be cute. not worth the money either! it's expensive and ill-fitting. for reference i am 5'3 and 123lbs and wear a 2 or 4.",1
"I was excited to see this sweater in my local store. i have been coveting it online. it was just as pretty in person as i hoped it would be. 
the color is vivid and beautiful. i loved the buttons down the back. 
i usually wear a size small but they only had an extra small. i tried it on and liked the way it fit. i wanted a snugger look. i think the small would have worked too, just a looser feel.
the fabric is very soft. now just waiting for cooler weather so i can wear it.",5
Just received my second pair of pilcro in the red. i loved the color and needed a back up pair. perfect fabric for year round wear. length is great for my height. love every pair i own. this is my 12th pair. love love them.,5
"The structure makes this fit perfectly. the details are also lovely, and it is soft and well-made. it is a little sheer, but i felt comfortable enough to wear it with just a black bra underneath. if you are between sizes, i would probably size up.",5
"The color is more like bluish-green, very elegant! it's very soft and feels great on skin. i love the buttons on the back, it's such a great touch and brings this sweater to a whole new level. 
i usually wear xs but because i'm going to wear this sweater with a button up shirt underneath, i ordered s. great investment! love to have it in my closet.",5
"I thought the design of this dress was distinctive, and it did not let me down. there is no zip so if your chesty like i am it may be a little difficult to get on, but i wouldn't sizes up because then it would be too big and balloony. i'm 5'5' and i got the petite which hit me about 2 inches above my knee. material is like jeans and consequently not see-through at all. even though it is quite expensive, there is something special about the dress.",5
"Great top, for me it would be tuck in only as a little wide near waistline. i am 5'4 so can do it with top length, but not sure someone taller could. so depends on wardrobe needs what you plan on wearing it with. would probably look cute with skinny jeans, but i bought it for skirts. adorable detailing around neckline and sleeves. really love it, but more sheer than i expected. great with a nude bra, but probably would see other colors through it.",5
"Super soft and cute. the buttons add a nice touch. the color depicted online gave me pause, but when i saw it in the store it was more of a blue than that what you see in pic. great investment. beautiful sweater. 34c, 65"", 135 and the small is perfect.",5
"Sadly, this has to go back. i am 5'5"", 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me. very short. and it's so wide it's almost a trapeze cut. the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt. which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful, the detail is nice in person, even the sleeve cuffs are great. i am not very tall and i'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles, loose and tight. the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering.",1
Loved this top! it's an a-line shape which is very flattering. thick enough for winter with a coat but light enough for spring still.,5
I'm normally a 12/14 and ordered my normal size 32 which fit perfect. i purchased both the red and beige. the quality fit and color are great. i'm 5'9 and the regular length was fine.,5
I see many uses for this sweater. it is so whimsical. i love it!,5
"I ordered this sweater in a s and i am happy with the sizing. i am 5'6"" 130 and athletic build, it is not a long sweater and looks just like the sweater on the model. i typically like longer sweaters but this will look great with a pair of flare jeans and a nice belt.",5
"I purchased these shorts in a size 24. i'm on the petite side of things and the shorts are a little big. the tie-front allows you to tighten the short. i actually think the photo does a good job showing this item. the color is a washed out gray and the shorts are not too ""short."" the fabric is light and this will be great for hotter days. i like them.",5
Tried this lovely navy dress on in the store in a size 6 and it was perfect. wish there had been a petite available to try since the hem fell below the knees on me and it would have to be hemmed. the crisscross on the front is very flattering to the waistline and i love the see through fabric along the shoulders and back. it's stretchy too!,5
"This is such a great work wear piece for me. it's form flattering, well constructed, comfortable and truly elegant. this is probably my 5th or 6th dress from the moulinette soeurs line and i am consistently impressed with the quality and wearability of these clothes.

5'7"" 127lbs 34b wearing a size 4",5
This dress is perfect. it's ridiculously soft (i felt like i was wearing pajamas) and it fits perfectly. the quality is great; well worth your purchase.,5
"This dress fits beautifully. the fabric is thick enough to feel significant and not flimsy, but the dress doesn't feel heavy at all. the detail is gorgeous, but still subtle. it's a little too nice for me to wear to work, but the perfect special occasion or party dress",5
"This dress is amazing! i bought this dress for my daughter for her college graduation. it fits like a dream. she normally wears a size 2 but i got the 4 which was perfect. with the slightly longer length, it is very professional but with the lace cut outs is great for a party, as well. it is very flattering and well made.",5
"I really wanted to like this dress. the color is perfect, the design and cut are cut (not always the case at retailer). however, the fabric quality was terrible - a shiny acrylic with cheap nylon lace. it looked like something from a discount store and had to go back.",1
"Boy is this a winner. the fabric has quite a bit of stretch, so it is form fitting but with enough structure that it doesn't make you bulge out in weird places. i can wear it with a blazer as a (admittedly dressy) day-to-evening look, and i can tell i'm going to get a lot of mileage out of it for the season's holiday parties. i am bigger on bottom than on top, and sometimes that can end up with weird bagginess around the bust for me, but not with this dress. i'm tall #5'8) and so the length is g",5
"Great dress. wonderful on hourglass and skinny straight shaped girls.
love the color combination and fit.",5
"Love the fabric and design of this dress, very unique and comfortable. it is not lined, which explains the lower price when compared to other well fashioned dresses. i wore it successfully with stockings and no slip and it did not ride up or cling strangely. the fabric is stretchy and form fitting without feeling tight. the ribbons that define the detail around the waist were a bit snug but we're not uncomfortable. they define the waist very well. i am 5'7'',127lbs, athletic build and the 4 fit",5
"I can wear this to work or dress it up as a cocktail dress. the fit is great, and the quality is very high. am usually a 2 or a 4, depending on the dress, and the 2 worked better in this one, so if you are between sizes, i would size down.",5
"I cannot say how much i love this dress. i purchased it in mid-november and i'm wearing it for the 4th time this evening, which prompted me to write a review. it fits tts. the stomach area is slightly unforgiving, but due to the dark color, it's not at all a deal breaker. plus, it's a great dress to wear with opaque tights, which solve the tummy issues as well. what i love most about this dress is its ability to go from day to night/less formal to more formal. it looks great with edgy black ankl",5
"Comfortable shorts. thinner fabric. pattern disguises underwear lines. love the exterior pockets, as i won't have to tuck them in when i zip up. as the previous reviewer said, the black and white pattern has blue accents. they're mid-rise and a longer length, which i appreciate.",5
"I am very petite (5', 96-100 lbs) and find this to be pretty formfitting (not in a bad way) - a rare feat for petites! it is very comfortable - soft, sweater-like material and texture, which does make the dress feel slightly cheap to me, but it doesn't make it look cheap. it's also beautifully patterned in person, pretty true to the online photo, with the only difference being the dress is darker in person, so i don't feel the blue stands out as much as it does on the online photo. the length is",5
"If i saw this online i would never have glanced at the picture twice. instead, i came across it at the store and immediately snatched it up to try on. the green is very spring-y and rich while the raised little dots give it a lovely texture overall. really adorable on and fits fine in the regular although i am usually petite.",5
I am in love with this top. i was a little nervous because i'm on the bustier side (34d/dd) but it works for me so i say give it a shot--you never know. i'm hoping for more tops like this in the fall line.,5
Love this piece. it is warm and attractive and will set any outfit off from a dress to jeans and a t-shirt. i look forward to wearing it often.,5
"Tried it on in store, it's more of a cornflower blue instead of a true navy. if you zoom in you'll also notice there's a pattern to it. i think it gives it a little something extra. i may put gold buttons on it as the plain black buttons are a little boring. 

 didn't buy it right away and came back with a survey coupon and it was out of stock. had them order and free-ship it to me from the store. 

fit is nice and relaxed. i like how it goes up in the back so it pairs well with dresses and",5
"Very fun shirt. is see through beyond lace so need to wear black tank or black bra. very comfy, flirty and feminine. tts. flowy fit like on model.",5
What a flattering top! great with jeans or shorts. i'm a sz12 and l was perfect for me. love the colors - got lots of comments.,5
Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.,5
"This white blouse is absolutely stunning in person. i wore it with a nude strapless bra. note to self: remove makeup before blouse, otherwise it's all over your blouse.",5
"Cannot believe this is still available and on sale. am 5' 6 1/2"", 150lbs, size 12 is perfect. this jacket goes with everything i try it with. it is silky smooth but still has structure. is a softer blue than navy. i love it! this is an absolute steal on sale.",5
"This is a gorgeous blouse. the quality is on point. i was so disappointed because i had to return it.
the blouse was just a few inches too tight across the bust.",5
"Retailer has incredible service, and so they let me return this dress even after having worn it. however, this dress cannot be cleaned. i saw a stain on it after the first use, so i first tried hand washing it. however, the black part of the dress came off on the white part, making the stain worse. i then tried dry cleaning it (the care tag allows both) and that produced 3 or 4 new stains where the black rubbed off on the white. it's a beautiful, striking dress (that would be great maternit",1
"I was looking for a cute going out top that was age-appropriate (40yo). i read other reviews that it ran large so i got xxs regular (xs not available) for reference, i am 5'2"" and 95 pounds but semi-broad in the shoulders.

i was wary of the poly fabric but it is surprisngly nice and drapes well- easy care for sure. doesn't look cheap at all. when worn on the shoulders, the elastic is tightish, but maybe i could have gone to xs if they had it but at least i know the xxs won't fall/slide.

I love this top! super soft fabric and beautiful with jeans. getting ready to retire and will make this a regular in my new wardrobe! thanks retailer for putting it on sale!,5
"Color is very nice and dark, with just a little fading around the knee. i sized down to 25 from my usual 26-27 (5.4' 120 lb).",5
"This vest goes with literally everything. it is the perfect amount of added warmth - though it's a bit hard to fit under a coat. the only thing i will say negatively about it is that it seems to shed on the inside a bit... but otherwise the quality, color, and length are perfect. and i love the pockets!",5
"Dress runs a little small, tight on top. so i had to exchange from a size 8 to a size 10. originally ordered a petite but petite wasnt available in the 10 so i will probably have to get altered for an extra expense. the material is light and soft, flowers are muted. maybe would of prefered a little sleeve but design is so cute.",5
"I consider myself fairly busty (34 d), but i didn't have any problems wearing my normal size small/medium.....i actually went with the small. the lace inset doesn't give, but it wasn't tight at all. i love the flow of the blouse....it is going to be a great transitional piece into fall!",5
"Unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size. for reference i'm 5'3, 117 lbs, 34 b cup, and took an xs. top fits comfortably, no tightness around the chest, and sleeves' fullness isn't overwhelming. the lace is see through, so a cami is a must. top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship. i have not laundered it yet, so i can't comment on that. so happy with my purchase! a keeper for sure!!",5
"Get this while you can. it will not last to hit the sales. it is a beautiful top, with very unique colors and pattern-reminds me of key west. it has a slight tent shape at the bottom, which is not how it appears to be, but the cut is very nice and well done. i wouldn't size down, as the armholes are not huge, and then it would be too tight. i will have to cut them about 1/2"" to not bug me, and i'm typically a med, which is the size i got. i could take the sides in about 1"" on each side, which is",5
"I have never written a review before, and i love retailer and shop here often. however, i am so unhappy with this shirt i wanted to share to save someone else money. it is such poor quality, it looks thick and flows in the photo, it is very thin and it itches so bad, i could hardly even stand to try it on when it came in the mail. i will deff be taking it back, and do not recommend it at all.",1
"The fabric is very comfortable and soft.
love it - great fit.(tts)
would recommend",5
"These pants are amazing! i usually have a hard time finding ones to fit me due to my small size (5'1"" 100 lbs) but the 0 fit me perfectly. they are not too tight, just slim enough without clinging to you like a second skin. love the length , hits just above the ankle bone. versatile and comfortable. however, if i were any heavier, i cannot say these pants would work. i am fairly thin, in most cases i would size up.",5
I love this top in peach! i usually wear a size 8 and ended up buying the large because that was all they had in store. it fits well but loose. i usually front tuck it in. what i love the most about this top is the perfect way it slouches off your shoulders. very effortless but doesn't feel like it is falling off. a few other off the shoulder tops i tried are either falling off or rising up (and you constantly have to pull them down over your shoulders) due to elastic in the shoulder. this top h,5
"I'm so glad i found this gem in the store, as the online pic does this shirt no justice!  the green version is vibrant and adorable, and this shirt is lightweight, without being see-through.  for sizing reference: i'm 5'4"", 135 lbs, 34c and a size 6 petite.  i tried this in the store in a size 4 and an 8 (only sizes they had) and rushed home to order it online in a 6.  perfect fit, so i believe its true to size.  the little details...the buttons and stitching make this shirt such a winner!",5
"Classic dress with a twist with split colors. very comfortable without looking like a bag on. can be dressed up or down. i am 5'7"" 118 and bought th extra small. perfect fit for me. not form fitting but still has shape and style.",5
"I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it on various mother's day weekend insta posts by retailer stores. i was worried that it would not be a great cut for me, as it's pretty straight up and down, and i wasn't sure the waist would hit at the right place, because i'm super high waisted and this didn't appear to be so. in truth, it isn't, and i'll be tying the ribbon (or wearing a slim belt) at a higher point than where was originally intended. however, what struck me was the ability",5
"This dress is stunning. i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from. my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it. initially i thought it was supposed to be that way, but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed. it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out, but it is totally worth it.",5
"I bought this top for my daughter. the colors are so vibrant and the design and feel of the top is flattering. this top can be worn with black pants for a night out with friends, or with jeans or shorts to hang out at the beach! my daughter loves it!",5
"This shirt is nothing like the online pictures. it's a stunner in person. ended up with the black one though i was torn between it and the white. i would agree with some other reviewers that it has little to no give across the chest so i bought a l due to broad shoulders. the m fit like a glove and i was afraid it might tear if i raised arms or reached for something. not sure if a large busted girl would be comfortable. though i sized up, it didn't affect the way it hangs and it hangs beautifull",5
"I love this off the shoulder top. it is so flattering  and the  colors are gorgeous. i normally wear a small or medium in retailer tops, i am wearing an extra small in this one, and it fits great. i am only 5 1"" tall so the length hits me perfectly.",5
"I was not sure about ordering this dress, but i'm glad i did! i love the cut and all the details...very unique! i am usually a 10 and the medium fits me perfectly. love, love! if you're on the fence about ordering this dress, i say go for it. for reference, i'm 5' 6"" and the hem hits me mid-calf.",5
This dress looks very good on me! it's a cute way to appear dressy without the extra work to look the part.,5
"Unfortunately, i will need to exchange for a bigger size. i am 5""3"", 115 pounds. i normally wear a 2 or a 4. i ordered a 4 and they are a bit too tight. i am worried the 6 will be to big but love the pants enough to give that a try. excellent quality.",5
"I bought this blouse in black in december of 2015. like other reviewers noted, it has a bit of an odd fit with the lace being a bit constrictive across the bust and raising arms. it wasn't a deal breaker because i loved the look of the blouse. however, i just purchased this blouse in the new color blue in july of 2016 and i'm happy to say the blue color is looser and i have no problems with the lace being constrictive around the bust or arms.

"I tied this on a whim, thinking it was a big 80s on the hanger, but it is so cute and hip, i fell instantly in love. the material is amazingly soft and generally doesn't wrinkle. i wore it for my thesis presentation and it went flawlessly! it has a very light light-grey window pane print on it that looks great with grey pixie pants, white pants, and the blue is light enough you could even pair it with black bottoms and jeans. a total catch, and the fun layover in the back is just an added pop of",5
"You must have this vest for your fall/winter wardrobe. the design is extremely flattering to the female curves. i love the feminine ruffles. the pockets are a bonus. the vest is vegan-friendly. a hundred percent polyester! i normally wear a medium, but the small size fits me better. as an artist, i like to wear with my red plaid retailer shirt. hurry and get this vest before they are sold out. i'm sick i missed out on the museum district vest. all the smalls were sold out. i hope my experie",5

Thank you to all of the reviewers who took the time to write a review. your reviews are what help me know exactly which size to order and how to know that i needed a regular instead of a petite. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a size 8 in retailer sizes. i went with a medium regular based on other reviews. thanks so much because the fit was perfect though still a little roomy.,5
"I had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy. im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest. not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver.
wouldn't recommend it.",1
The material is so thin and so itchy..like other reviewers stated..it itches so bad and feels like sandpaper..i thought it would be ok to wear a tank top underneath but sleeves are still itchy. otherwise the design is great and the long peplum hem is very pretty and would look great with skinny pants or leggings and boots,1
"I paired this beauty with the beacheress necklace and the result was stunning. the colorway in this top just makes my summer tan pop! i am 5'3""/36b/108 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. since it does run short there is no way that i would suggest anyone go with a petite unless they are under 5' and/or very short waisted! the fabric in the top drapes beautifully and i felt super feminine all evening...and got tons of compliments as well!",5
"It's embarrassing to admit but i am buying this top for the second time because i've misplaced the first one and i fear that if i wait too long trying to recover it that it will be a sold out item and i'll never be able to have it again... hence the decision to repurchase. i just love it that much. i'm sure that now that i have the second top the first one will mysteriously show up, lol!

anyway, this top is a very flattering off the shoulder style. one of the things i really like about it is",5
"The girls at the local retailer are big fans of coh, & i've been thinking maybe i shld try them out. i ordered these online in the size 29, as i am usually a 28/29 in skinnys. i am a little hard to please, or say hard to fit in skinny jeans. i like a snug good looking skinny but not so much if it's uncomfortable. paying full price it is expected for the look & fit to be perfect. even if on sale, i won't go it if i think something is not right for me. at 5'3"", 117#, slender legs, skinnys are either",5
This is such a cute top. i like it both off and on the shoulder. easily tucked or left out depending how you want to style it.,5
"I tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on. it's beautifully made, the fabric is soft, comfortable, and free-moving, and overall it has a lovely vintage, romantic look. i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week, and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well, especially the lovely way the fabric draped. another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie, but once tha",5
This is a great looking top in person. i've worn this with jeans or skirts for different looks and it's cute both ways. i would order a size up though as it is not a flexible fabric so the shoulders/chest area need a little room to move comfortably.,5
"I was hesitant to buy this because some reviews said that if you were busty it would fit tight and awkward across the chest.. i'm petite, 32c, 5ft and purchased the xsp in white .it is gorgeous! it fits a tiny bit big and i think i could have gotten away with a xxsp, but i like the flowiness of this size i have so i'm keeping it. it does not feel tight across the chest at all and hangs beautifully. i love it! the material is gorgeous and it is well made.",5
"I am so glad i read the reviews for this before i purchased it. i am 5'5 and 135 pounds and normally wear a size 6 in dresses. i would normally buy a small, but sized down to an xs and it was perfect! it's a beautiful dress and very flattering!",5
"This top is my new favorite. i thought it might have too much volume, but it does not. it is very flattering. the color looks just like the picture.",5
"This dress is really beautiful. i plan on wearing it to my nephew's wedding in april. my only complaint would be is that it runs extremely small. i am 5 feet tall and 90 pounds, slim build, and normally wear a 00p or 0p. i ended up with the 2p, and it fits perfectly. my advice to anyone considering purchasing is to order several different sizes and return the ones that don't fit.",5
"I love this shirt so much that i bought a second one even though they are exactly the same. the cut and the fit are free and easy, so comfortable and how many shirts are all cotton anymore? washes well, hang dry, easy to care for. i recommend this shirt for a casual look with style!",5
"I love these shorts. they're really comfortable and versatile. i got them on sale, and for the price they were a steal! the material is nice, and you can dress them up or down.",5
"I purchased this top during the 20% off sale and i'm very pleased with it. i love how flowy it is without looking like a maternity top. for reference, i'm 5'4, 130# and purchased a small (my usual retailer size). if you have broad shoulders you may have to size up as i found the arms and shoulders to run a little small.",5
"I am not in love with this top and will be returning it. from the front it looks like a basic tee (which i expected) but the back ""x"" is too loose and slumps to the side so that it doesn't look like an ""x"" as the picture shows. so basically the focal point of the tee falls short.",1
"I loved this look! it's s great light hoodie to throw on. comfortable, nice color, and unique with the plaid later! i'm 5'3"" and the xs fit well.",5
"I love these pants! they really make you look and feel classy. i also bought the feather tank and absolutely love this outfit! it is flattering, beautiful and oh so comfy! true to size,",5
"Love this top! the quality is great and the pattern is even cuter in person. i'm 5'4"", 125 lbs and bought my normal size s which fits perfectly. it's pretty flouncy and roomy, which is nice because it hides my post-baby tummy. especially love how the back covers my bottom which means i can wear my skinny black leggings underneath. definitely recommend!",5
This top is so pretty and feminine. i love how the design and quality of this top.,5
Very comfy and really nice fabric. can see myself wearing these a lot. i'm a size 12 and the fit was perfect.,5
This is so soft and really cute. would be a good bathing suit cover- must wear a cami under it.,5
I bought this top in black and love it! the crossed straps in the back give it a stylish twist. i also tried it in white and found it to be a little see thru.,5
These shorts are super comfy and the color is awesome!,5
"I bought these pants online in blue, and loved them so much that i bought them in the bronze two days later. very flattering fit, comfortable, great quality, and i look and feel like a class act wearing them. they're a bit of a looser taper style of fit, but that's just the style, and i've received so many compliments on them!",5
This dress looks amazing on. it fits your body like a glove and the zipper lies flat. the black out-lined neckline looks very sophisticated as does the pattern of the dress. my only issue is that the dress ran very small.,5
"This is a heavier weight shirt. it is fitted through the bust and shoulders and very loose below so, if you don't like loose fitting clothes, this is not for you. it is well made and looks cute with jeans.",5
"I absolutely love this shirt. it's so easily dressed up and is still really cute just on top of black pants and flats. great for the holiday season too! i am normally a size medium in all tops, i am 5'8'', 150 lbs, athletic-built and the medium is perfect. true to size, definitely recommend!!",5
Tried this top on in store in a small and it was a bit snug in the chest (32dd) but loved it otherwise. the sales associate had it shipped to me in a medium and it is perfect!! a great length over leggings or skinny jeans and is lightweight enough for warmer days or can be layered with a tank underneath and a cropped cardigan for colder ones.,5
"Nice top. you can dress it up or down. runs very large, i had to exchange sizes twice. my regular top size is 10 but end up buying size 6.",5
"These are lovely, dressy pants, but they act larger than they need to (even for the model above, see photos). i usually order size 8-10 in pants, and size 10 in these fit at the waist but felt bulky below, partly because of large pockets made of the same material. another detail to note: there is metallic thread running thru out the material, glinting more than the photos show. the golden vertical leaflets don't show as much, because of the overall shine. so i will return these lovelies, because",5
"Tis is a soft, soft cotton shirt that is comfortable and cute. it's a great top to use put on and go. i'm looking forward to wearing it often!",5
"This tee is versatile, soft, well made, and it washes/dries well. i love longer length and stripe pocket details. it runs true to size, and it is a beautiful dark navy blue. what more can i ask for?",5
Love all things mes demoiselles and these do not disappoint! the gold does not show in the picture but they sure do sparkle...in a great way. the fabric is rich and can be worn all year as they are light weight for summer but carry a look perfect with sweaters. i love them and with the sale on sale they were a steal and happy to have them...they will be that one piece that i will grab again and again. i love the look of peasant blouses and shorter vests...in a contrast print would be incredible,5
Love this top. great twist on a traditional plaid. looks great with skinny jeans or leggings. i get compliments on it every time i wear it.,5
"Super light and soft. haven't worn it out but expect to wear with jeans. it will be cute and comfy. i'm 5'2"", 130 lbs and bought a small, fits well.",5
"I really liked these pants! they are so audrey hepburn. i especially like how they come up high on my waist. i actually bought 3 different pairs of ""essential"" pants and kept all of them. (essential taper and essential slim). i stated that these run small but they just seem to run smaller than the other two. i'm 5'3"" and they are a touch longer than i'd like but that is an easy fix. for reference, i'm 110 lbs and bought size 2 in these and 0 in the others",5
So soft and comfortable ? i wish i'd bought the other colour too!,5
"Thank you retailer! these really are the perfect black pants. great fit and construction. the material doesn't wrinkle, they slim and shape the body and they are at a good price point. i did have to go up one size but i especially love the elastic in the waistband. my local store almost sold out of these in a day.",5
Love these jeans.,5
"This is probably my new favorite bathing suit. the colors are a tad different than in the picture, but still really pretty",5
Runs a bit small. very slimming. love these. when will they be available in moss again?,5
"These pants fit tts and are ask pictured in length on me (5'5""). i can go between a 4 and a 6, and tried the 6 and they were fine. that said, the fabric completed turned me off. it is that sort of stretch fabric with a sheen to it. i did not find them to be the wonderful wardrobe basic i thought they'd be- the fabric is just too stiff, and the sheen made them feel cheap, unfortunately.",1
"Love this suit. i ordered up a size on the bottoms, and am so glad i did. the style fits true to size, is beautiful, and vibrant. i thought it looked like ribbing vertically, but it is just part of the design. it is not padded at all, but is thick enough to be seamless.",5
"Tried one at the store. love the look and feel of this pants. so soft and flowy! sizing runs large. for reference, i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs. xxsp fits just right. highly recommended!",5
"I purchased these pants while on vacation because i thought they'd be the perfect addition to my comfy travel wardrobe. on my second wear, i happened to be on a long-haul flight when the entire side seam split about a food long on my upper, outer thigh. luckily i'd packed a back-up dress. the pants weren't tight at all, but the seams wren't strong enough to handle a little pressure from sitting i guess. poor construction. i would not recommend these.",1
"Love this top for spring - great with athletic leggings, regular leggings or jeans. it is a lot longer in the back, which i like as it covers my butt and makes leggings work-appropriate. great quality. true to size - i am 5'9"" and 128 lbs - xs fits perfectly. fabric is a little wrinkly but that is intentional. lighter material so it is good for spring weather, but sturdy enough not to be see through at all.",5
"I'm a tunic girl--have to admit that. for me this top is fab.  i love roomy, swingy tops and this is exactly that. as others have mentioned, it is quite roomy at the bottom, however the weight of the fabric is so light it lays very nicely.  i love how it fits in the arms. i hate when arms are too big. the sleeve fits snugly. for reference i am 5'5"" 140 lbs. the small fit perfectly. i have already worn several times to work. perfect in the a/c.",5
"I'm just ordering my 3rd pair!! i first got the grey,,,just about live in them! super comfy and flattering! then i got the off white and now i ordered the green which i cannot wait to get. great pant!",5
"Perfect.
these cords are soo soft, but hold their shape
low rise is great for shorter people ! regular rise comes just between navel and bra !",5
I purchased these in white and love them! fit my muscular thighs fine.,5
"Love this top! it runs very true to size, is not too boxy, and looks great on my 5""1"" body (i bought a medium). i purchased the beige top first, then bought this one. great addition to my wardrobe.",5
This tunic is flowy without having too much material to make you look bigger.  i love the way it fits.  i'm 5'4 125 lbs and got a small.,5
"I was on the fence about ordering this jacket, but i'm so glad i did. i got my birthday discount to help afford it. as the first reviewer said, the weight is substantial, but not too heavy, and the embroidery is beautiful! i have not worn this jacket yet, but i expect to get many compliments when i do! i usually don't wear jackets in this style, so it's a fresh, new approach for me....the embroidery takes it to the next level! it fits true to size. i usually take a medium, and the medium fits pe",5
"I can't say enough about this pant! the fit is perfect, enough shape to hold you in but not so tight you think you're wearing leggings. this is my go to business casual. can't wait to get another color, my store had this in black",5
These are super comfy and so flattering. i feel like the picture doesn't do them any justice! they would also look cute paired with wedges!,5
"I like these pants a lot. got one pair in black
and one pair in holly. the green holly are just a perfect green, so nice for the season. they are very comfy and feel right all day without any sagging.
i highly recommend and would buy more if they weren't on the pricier side.
oh and great for causal but also dresses up nicely with some heels and a silk blouse",5
You can't go wrong with these pants. as other reviews point out when they say skinny they do mean that this is a skinny fit so order accordingly. i ordered a 4 when i have been wearing 2s in many other styles and was glad for the 4. i thought the fabric was all season so don't agree with some other reviewers regarding the stiffness of the fabric. i think it's perfect. everyone is different. these are pretty close to year-round wearable.,5
I'm 5 ft 7 125 lbs true size 4 and these pants made me look like i had boy parts. super disappointed!,1
"I really love this top; i got the ivory and now i will probably get the black too. if you get it in your normal size (i'm almost always an xs and got this in xs), it's fitted and flattering. the seam across the sternum makes it feel like an empire top which always seems to look good on me. it is fitting in the chest and arms. it's really lightweight and has 1/2 sleeves so i will wear this even in summer.",5
"This jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo. also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton, but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim. the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension... . i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer. can't wait until cooler weather so i may live in it! also when you have it on for a bit it seems to",5
"Just bought this and am in love with it. it's a really nice weight - light for spring. the drape-y fit is very flattering. it's longer in the back than in the front and has a nice swing to it. can't wait to wear it!

i tried on the tee in the lighter color and didn't care for it much - i liked the contrast of the black and silver stripes.",5
"Love the cut on these cords as well as the fabric. it's a somewhat thin corduroy with a nice little stretch which makes them very comfortable and very flattering. they are true to size. i got the grey which is a pretty, light grey without the heavy blue undertone you often get in grey fabric.

great cords!",5
"I'm a 0/2 on top with 32d's and i purchased this top in a medium and it fit perfectly. pretty colors go with a mix of bottoms. design is both functional and attractive, which usually isn't the case with swimwear. love the underwire cups, adjustable ties and straps. and the fabric is really soft and comfortable.",5
"These pants are a great addition to my work wardrobe. i needed to size up more so for my legs vs my waist, but nothing a little tailoring won't fix.",5
"I ordered online and got it home tried it on and loved it. it is too cute i plan to wear it with bright colored belt and shoes probably red, yellow, or pink plus i bought a polka dot tote same color cream and black and a blazer can't wait to wear it. i love the fact that i can wear it spring, summer, fall as well winter with my blazer. i'm keeping it.",5
"I'm 5'5"" 120 lbs and bought this in size medium because i have long arms and was afraid that the cashmere would shrink even if i hand-wash and dry flat (because let's be honest--i doubt i'll ever send it to the dry cleaner). it's loose through the body and arms, but the sleeves are the perfect length. the term ""bell sleeve"" is no exaggeration. the sleeves are billowy and voluminous and i can see them getting in the way while washing my hands or doing dishes. i guess i will have to reserve this s",5
"It is very comfortable and the fabric is amazing. it runs a little short on me because i have a long torso, but it works great with a tank underneath. love it!",5
"Love these pants . very flattering and comfortable and cool. perfect for the hot summer days.

they have washed well. need ironing. the charcoal ran a little bigger and too long but the hot dryer shrank them . the orange were perfect, still a little longish so i cold wash them and hang to dry to keep from shrinking

5.5' size 8",5
So flattering on my curvy (and busty) body.  so many swing style tops have too much fabric and make you look larger than you actually are.  not the case with this top - the fabric and cut make the bottom half flow beautifully; so flattering imo.  i usually wear a small or medium in meadow rue and went with the small.  the shoulders and arms fit my small bone structure perfectly; the burn out pattern and color are gorgeous.   can?t wait to wear!,5
"These pants are awesome! very light weight and will be great for spring/summer. now if only the sunshine will get here and melt away all of this snow!

i also purchased the top pictured on the model, it is super cute with this outfit and can work with so many different looks. check it out!

they run big, i would definitely consider sizing down or ordering two sizes to try on.",5
"Love this top and the fit is very true to size. i am 5'3 and 144 and ordered a medium. the fabric weight is just right and not see through, the top did not gap and the length falls just over tummy without being too tent-like too snug or too long so can be worn inside or out. wish there were more color choices to order from. it was touted as red motif but i would call it more red-orange. i cannot wear orange but it is ""red-enough"" to pull off on my skin tone with the white background. the sleeves",5
I love these pants so much i had to write a review! purchased the carbon color recently in regular length - the length stated is pretty true and there was minimal shrinkage for me. size was also tts (typically wear size 2 and got 26). i've been wearing them often! they look great right out of the dryer and drape nicely. i've been purchasing the pilcro linen trousers for years but these are my favorites this season --- i also think the quality is much better. i will be getting them in more colors,5
I got the black in an xs and it fits wells. its a bit warmer than i expected. i love the design of this sweater! perfect with leggings.,5
"This shirt is so cute alone with jeans or dressed up with nice jewelry, a scarf or cardi. its just the right weight, true to size, drapes nicely and its very flattering. i""m sorry i didn't order more when i had the chance. its already sold out in the colors and sizes i wanted. excellent quality as usual -- thanks again retailer!",5
"I love how soft, and substantial the fabric is. the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully. the ruffle detail is very flattering. i have broad shoulders and this top looks great.",5
"These are fantastic, great fit, super comfortable material and perfect length (petite). i ordered the carbon to have a neutral pair, but i also want the other colors! 0p fit 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs. length on petite is enough to have a small heel) i have short legs).",5
"What a great, easy to wear jumpsuit! i love that the sleeves are a relaxed fit...sometimes they make these jumpsuits so unforgiving who wants to wrangle your way in and out? anyway i totally agree with the other reviewers that this is very stylish, comfortable and it looks amazing on.",5
It was love at first sight. the only problem was that it didn't come in my size. i took a chance and order a size smaller and it worked out great. its a great item that can be worn in the spring and fall. exactly what i was looking for.,5
"Love, love, love. i have both colors and wear with leggings. it's not a heavy sweater and has a great drape, super flattering. i'm usually a medium and it runs true to size - not supposed to be tight. i find it a little low in the front,but a tank underneath takes of it. washes well.",5
"Great style and quality. however sizing runs smaller than anticipated.
i gave it as a gift to a friend who wears a smaller size than me.",5
"I went back and forth about buying this jumpsuit. very glad that i decided to make the purchase. i wore the jumpsuit to a holiday party and look forward to pairing it with a blazer for work. the material is very soft, yet durable. i wore with flats, but it would be cute with a colorful pair of heels.",5
I love the coral color! allows me to add color to my neutral wardrobe! very flattering!!! i get a lot of compliments on them!,5
"I really didn't expect to like these pants as much as i do. i ordered a pair of the pilcro linen wide legs and really loved the cute added lace details on them. i thought i would exchange these for another pair of those, but after trying both pairs on, i realized how much softer and heavier these are. i will keep the one pair of the pilcro, but they did feel a little scratchy. these have a very nice drape to them and they do make your bum look nice. i ordered a size 8, which is what i seem to we",5
"It takes perfection for me to pay this much for a pair of pants, and these delivered! i bought these pants love-at-first-sight in the carbon color. i have not washed them yet, so i can't comment on durability, but they fit like a dream. i carry extra weight in my thighs and rear, and these pants are very flattering and slimming, and don't pull and crease in the crotch area like so many other pants do on my body. my usual size fit perfectly, and the length is great on my 5'5"" frame. i can almost",5
"This top is unique and gorgeous! i'm a singer and i knew i had to have it for an upcoming performance. it's got a really great ethnic/bohemian beauty and femininity to it. i saw the top on-line, then i went to the store to try it on. it is delicate- it has beading, embroidery and mesh, so one has to be careful putting on jackets, brushing up against things, etc. but it's well worth it. please note that due to the lining, it does run small, i had to go up a size. depending on how you'd like it to",5
"""does this sweater make my hips look big?"" my wife asked. this sweater was one of my christmas gifts to this fair maiden.
.
""no, love, it does not,"" i said, but i looked, to make sure my reflex was also correct. it's a beautiful sweater for my dear bride, mother of our three children, and no, it does not make her hips look big.

in fact, it draws out all her lovely lines and curves, just so. and she is a modest girl, so she wears a little undershirt so that her cleavage is somewhat...um...suppre",5
"I ordered this shirt online without seeing it in person, and it is great! it is true to size (if not slightly loose fitting) and a thick cottony-material with a pretty design. could be nice for spring, summer, or even fall with a cardigan.",5
I love this top!! very comfortable. wear it alone or under a sweater. i have the black also.,5
"For reference, i'm currently hovering in the 14 range for pants (called ""curvy"" on the lower half, hahaha), but purchased these in a 12. they are so flattering and comfortable, i returned to purchase a pair to keep stashed for when i wear out a pair and actually bought two pairs in a size 10 for when i loose weight. they look perfectly tailored! the fabric is substantial (more of a spring weight than summer), so you don't have to worry about showing skin beneath the unlined pant, and it drapes e",5
"Ordered this blouse in a small but it was too big, returned it for an xs. i weigh 123 lbs , i'm 5'3 1/2"".
i find sizing of clothing at retailer to be unreliable, i have had to return many items because of sizing issues. unfortunately i live too far away from a regular store so have to rely on shopping on line.
i will complement retailer on the unique designs of the clothing they offer.",5
I love this top. the quality is topnotch and it's true to size. it's not skintight but it's also not so roomy that you look pregnant! one thing that surprised me is that it's a silk material. i thought it was linen or something like that. but i love it!,5
"The pics online for this dress are horrible in comparison how stunning this dress is in person.
just received it and far exceeded my wildest expectations!
it is elegant, classy, and an understated sexy!
the colors are rich and vibrant.......gorgeous shades of plum and blue....a unique color combination that is gorgeous!
the open mess dress with the solid under layer is a wow!
beautiful and flattering fit.
it is a 10 !!!!
i ordered my usual size and i would say it is true to size, but slig",5
Looks so fun and whimsical on. love love love this for photos especially,5
"When i walked into my retailer store i was immediately drawn to this top. the online photo really does not do it justice. in person, it is stunning. i'm petite and usually a size 4, but the only sizes available were a 0 and a 6. it looked large so i tried the 0. it actually fit much better than i expected, considering i have a 32dd bust, but the seam across the chest was too tight. however i did not have a problem with the armholes, even going down two sizes. i have narrow shoulders, so maybe that",5
"I happened to see someone purchasing this top in the green at my local retailer store, and the sales associate told me they had just gotten then in and they were already almost gone. they only had one left, in size s. it fit, but was a bit too long for me so they ordered the sp for me. it's perfect! the color says turquoise, but it's actually more of an emerald green. it's a bright saturated color, much more beautiful than the online photo. i have green eyes and love the way it brings them out. it",5
Just bought this in black at my local store and it is adorable!  and very comfortable.  almost like your favorite t-shirt stepped up one notch!  it ran true to size for me!,5
"These pants are so soft and super comfy.
they look great with heels and sandals. 
they will be my go to this summer for sure.
would love them in black or navy.",5
"This is my go-to shirt. perfect for layering, perfect for around the house or perfect for topping an outfit with a scarf. the white is a little sheer but it's fine for me.",5
"These are the perfect wide legs.  they aren't overly wide (a common problem for petite women like myself, who cannot pull off the really wide styles), and they are nicely fitted in the top.  the fabric is a great weight, neither too heavy nor too light so they lay nicely. (the similar level 99 linen wide legs with the waist ties have a much lighter fabric that doesn't lay right, and i like these hei hei pants much better.). i said they run large because i tend the fluctuate between 00p and 0p, a",5
This top is cute love the ruffle sleeves. the store i got these had both colors so ended getting both colors because the top is cute. does run a little large i ended up going a size down.,5
"I thought this top was purely elegant. i'm 5'4"", and 135 lbs. i ordered a small and it fits perfectly. i thought the fabric was soft, but somewhat sheer on the top. it goes great with just about any pant.",5
Love this top! i get compliments on it every time i put it on! it dresses up a pair of jeans perfectly!,5
This sweater is thicker than some of the other cashmere sweaters i purchased at retailer this year. it is made with high quality cashmere as it is extremely soft. i wouldn't describe it as chunky or bulky though. it's probably made of at least 2 or maybe even 3 ply cashmere. the sleeves do run slightly short. i purchased the xs and it fits my petite frame perfectly! grab it while you can! it's so luxurious & super warm for the winter.,5
"I ordered this top in a 14, my usual size, and it fits fine, but it is way too short-waisted! it looks nothing like what the model is wearing. her top comes low on her waist, almost to her crotch area. mine was just about 2 inches below my belly button! it was almost as if they accidentally cut off the lower half of the top at the factory! very strange.",1
"I received this romper last week and have already worn it twice. it is soooo comfortable and the material is really soft. the romper is loose, yet fitted and very cute. i love the open back and the shorts are just the right length. i wish there were other patterns or colors available, too. i would definitely buy again!",5
"I purchased this top in the purple. it is much prettier in person then in the picture. the color is rich and vibrant. i am usually a large or xl but only needed the large in this top. 
the combination of fabrics is what makes this top special and the sheer bell sleeve really sets it off. 
i felt that it flowed perfectly, not as full as some of the fall retailer tops. (which are too full for me.)

I love this shirt! the pictures do not do it justice. intricate detail. lovely.,5
"If you're a girl with no junk in the trunk buy these pants! they make you look like you are working with something! i love them. i am 5'3"" and always struggle to find pants that aren't too long and that will help me not look like an ironing board. these are great. not too long in regular and like another reviewer said, you'll have a booty. great lightweight pants.",5
"These pants are as dreamy as linen but much more forgiving when worn all day. they fit true to size and are very flattering. i have 5 pair. they are my go to work pant that can be dressed up with an elegant tank if i have to run to dinner after work!
love them",5
"I love it!!! i can wear out to dinner or just out to lunch with
friends!",5
I love everything about this top! the fit and style are beautiful and the fabric high quality. it does run about a half size large (i'm usually a size 4 and needed an xs in this top). this is so versatile--i have worn it with a tangerine midi skirt and denim shorts and it looks great however i pair it. i highly recommend this!,5
"I saw a photographer wearing this at a wedding i went to in october. i absolutely fell in love. it is beautiful. i can't wait to wear it for the holidays! i got the small petite and i am 5'2"", 125 lbs. fit great. enjoy!",5
"I thought this was a fun piece to have, but didn't realize how versatile it was until i got home and started mixing it with either casual shoes, or dressing it up with fancier accessories.
i love this jumpsuit!
it is well made, and the fabric is of a quality that lends itself to both casual and dressy",5
"Just beautiful dress! it dits perfectly, tts and i feel like princess in it! highly recommend girls!",5
"I love cotton fabric, so i was very excited to find this shirt in gorgeous fall colors. i have the dark red/burnt orange color, and it is pretty. but i have worn the thing once, and today when i put it on again, i found 2 holes on the front of the shirt. so disappointed.",1
"This top is the perfect staple! the fabric is soft and comfortable. i generally wear medium tops, but the small fits perfectly. took the chance ordering online and i am very happy!",5
"Fantastic and comfortable top. i had to buy in black and white, because it was too cute to buy just one. love it. great staple for your wardrobe.",5
"This is a beautiful shirt. dressy, imo. it's tts, i would not size down in this shirt. can wear w/ black, white, moss, khaki, jeans, etc... love it.",5
"Absolutely beautiful top, worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(",1
Love my mother jeans and these are super cute for spring! they fit tts. i'm 5'7 and i bought my normal 25.,5
"I can tell already that this sweater is going to be in heavy rotation in my closet. it's a bit oversized and cozy, but the ribbon tie makes it neat and not sloppy. great with skinny jeans, flares or leggings. super cute with a cami underneath.",5
"I love this jacket. it is great for lounging because it is loose and comfortable, and it's great to have pockets to stash stuff in as i shuffle cozily around my house on cold, lazy days. it's not the world's most flattering fit (it's kind of boxy) but i bought it for comfort and i am delighted.",5
"I tried on an xs and it was boxy/roomy in the torso and the pocket on the wrist/forearm area made my arm look too bulky when i rolled the sleeves up like the model pictured. i love the idea of a relaxed fit cropped leather jacket in a versatile taupe color but when i tried this one on in person, it took me back to my childhood. i used to help my dad wash his cars when i was a kid and he used a leather chamois (""shammy"" for short) that was awesome for soaking up water. and that's what it felt lik",1
"I bought this in a beautiful cornflower blue at my retailer store. i don't see that color for sale online. the blue material was not thin or see through, but perhaps the white is. the fit is very structured, which helps me cover my mom belly. i have never said this before, but i think it looks better on me than it does on the model wearing white. on sale, i got this for about $20. i got it for a steal. i like the different directions of line patterns and the length is nice too. one thing you can't",5
"I absolutely love cozy sweaters and this is my new fave. i love that it ties and it feels elegant. so much fun with jeans and one of my fun tees underneath. or with a skirt, boots and hat. love it. i wear it as i'm sipping my tea in front of my fire place writing my book. yes i'm writing a book. its a cozy writing a book sweater-that is it!! its perfect for that. on my white sheep skin cozy rug and my animal print chairs. i'm in heaven sipping my coffee in my cozy room with my cozy sweater.",5
"This top really is lovely. i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans. i wash everything before i wear it. though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned, there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned. so i hand washed it with delicate soap. when the lighter colors came into contact with the black, the black immediately stained the light color. i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains, rinsed and hung it above my bath tub. it is cur",1
Wore this to my sons wedding. found it last minute when i had changed my mind about another byron lars dress. i felt awesome in it and got many compliments,5
I love this vest! it's perfect for day and dress up for the evening. very comfy!,5
"This skirt sparkles when you wear it- beautiful in winter. it is made well, great design and fit, true to size. it is a beautiful fabric with deep blue flowers stitched in, as well as soft silvery gold thread sewn into the background. great length too. fabulous.",5
Love this dress. sooo comfortable and flattering. i typically wear a 4-6 in dresses or can be between small and medium depending on style and cut. i went with xs on this dress and it's still very comfortable and loose fitting. the small size fit fine but seemed like too much fabric on the skirt.,5
"This dress is so soft, flowy and comfortable! the material is very smooth and silky. i'm hoping it holds up well over time with washing. i am 5""5, 120lbs and i ordered a xs. the elastic waist is a tad tight but otherwise it fits perfectly - just as shown on the model in terms of length and how the top fits. i said it runs a large because normally i would order a s but i think if i did, it would be too long and the arm holes might be too big.",5
"Like another reviewer said, the pictures do not do this fabric justice. it's lightly textured but still soft! i love the fit of this--just the right amount of oversized/flowy.",5
"I saw this in the retailer catalogue and knew i had to own this dress. everything about it speaks to me on a cellular level. the colour, the shape, the drape, the hem, !!!! and the little side stripes. be still my heart. i went into my local store and picked up the dress in xl and l to try on. i'm.... currently a new body shape because of too many burgers, a sports injury, and not enough cardio, so i figured i should size up for a moment. uh no. the xl was like a tent. fabric everywhere. i pulled",5
"I tried this dress on in the orange and loved it on me and felt it ran tts in my regular size small. i'm a 34d but very petite body type otherwise and didn't feel like this billowed out as much as some other reviewers described. it does have a loose feel on top which i actually like and inside there is a comfortable striped strapless top part that holds me in at the same time. i liked the feel, colors and lenth of the fabric plus i love anything with an elastic waist so i definitely plan on buyi",5
Love this sweater so much that i'm going to order another when it goes on sale! the material is not thick but it's a nice thin weight that i still feel cozy in. i love that it's not long in the back too. so cute and soft.,5
This jacket is a great buy at the sale price. drape is wonderful and the weight is nice; lightweight and will transition well from summer to fall. the adjustable ties at the waist make it very flattering on a curvy figure. i purchased the white and am going to purchase the black as well. definitely recommend.,5
"This jacket is pretty cute in person. it is a nice thick gauzy material. the black is more like a dark washed gray color. while i do like the jacket, i feel like it is cut a little wide... maybe i should have ordered a size down. i usually wear a combination of 6s and 8s and am usually between a small and medium. i ordered this in a medium, but there was quite a bit of extra fabric at the sides and in the shoulder area. i'm returning the jacket for now, but might reorder in a small another time.",5
"Oh my!! this dress is so cute! it fits me exactly like the pictures. i usually wear a 6 or 8 and ordered a medium. i maybe could have worn a small as well though. there is a lot of fabric to this dress, so if you're under 5'6"", it might overwhelm you! i'm 5'6"" and the medium was barely sleepy the floor in a low heel! this is s dress you can dress up or down. i also appreciated the neckline not being too revealing. and pockets!! that was a nice surprise! the fabric is a little thicker, so it's no",5
"I tried on the xs in the store and decided to size down (and get xxs petite). it looked much better. the length was flattering, and as others mentioned, the bottom is nice and flowy. it is comfortable, and the orange color is flattering and i love the striped detail on the sides. good casual dress, but i can dress it up with a bejeweled belt. i am 115 lbs 30dd chest for xxs petite...",5
"Just purchased this lovely sweater over the weekend during the 25% off sale. i went in to buy the rona sweater in grey (which i think is the same style with different name) but it was all sold out! the sa pointed me to a rack of these sweaters and i am happy with this choice! the back print is really cute and the sweater design and color is very flattering. it goes well with pants or skirt, and the front is not as short as i had imagined the rona sweater to be.",5
"Great quality, fit and fashion! retailer went back to the days of old with this piece and i am so glad! the piece is classic yet modern - real statement without going overboard!",5
"This dress, like all byron lars dresses is a work of art. it has true quality of workmanship. and fits like a glove. i always get compliments when i wear any of his dresses and i have 5!. this one is somewhere between casual and dressy. perfect for a dinner out on a saturday night!. order a petite if you are under 5 5""",5
"I didn't give this dress a second look for the longest time. when the summer tag sale came about, i decided to pop in and see if i could find a versatile summer dress. i was in need of a piece i could easily dress up or down. the burnt orange color variation caught my eye first, though i also tried on the neutral and it is also fabulous. this dress is amazing on! i am an hourglass shape, 5'8, size 6/8, 34 d chest, and i tried on both the small and medium. the small fit much better on me, and i r",5
Added this dress to my summer wardrobe in the rust color. it's a very relaxed dress. easy to throw on. as others have suggested in going to add a belt to this to add a little more flair. but i love this designer. but it does run large. sizing down helps immensely.,5
"I thought this dress looked so cute and comfortable and was excited to try it on, and i was majorly disappointed. it was incredibly unflattering, in every way. as a few of the other reviewers mentioned, if you have any sort of bust the dress will not hang nicely, the waist band was too high up and made me look pregnant. i'm 5'2 and curvy and usually take a lg in retailer, but this...ewww! i will say the color and material are gorgeous, but i'm guessing this is the type of dress that would look bes",1
"Great, light weight sweater. very simple and soft from the front and the back is adorable.",5
There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.,1
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful in person! the metallic thread is a subtle, stunning addition to this elegant piece. like the last person mentioned, it is thick, but i think it makes it look full rather than like a bag. i think the extra fabric/weight adds a more classic/traditional look to it, making it look more like a wool skirt from the 50s, 60s, or 70s. if you're not a fan of that look, you probably won't like the way this falls. like the description says, this is a piece that would neve",5
"Many internet reviews note that byron lars dresses run large and suggest that women 5'5"" and under should size down and go petite. i am 5'3"" and 101 pounds and the 0 petite size was too snug across my back and too short when i sat down. when i stood up i had to pull the dress down, as it would bunch up around the hips. therefore, the size 2 regular ended up being a perfect fit, no alterations needed. i was searching for a dress for an upcoming wedding and for vacation and kept coming back to thi",5
"Admittedly, i ignored this dress on a few trips to my local retailer and then it went on sale, practically begging me to give it attention. i tried it on and fell in love! so feminine, light, and comfortable. 
it has a sort of roman/boho goddess vibe due to the billowy top, especially in the lighter greige with some sea-hued accessories added but not so much it feels like cosplay or something. i have a full bust (dd) and didn't find this dress to be unflattering. after wearing it to a party, i ac",5
"Absolutely love this top, it falls perfect in all the right places. i've gotten so many compliments especially from the bow design on the back.",5
"I was hoping these would be like some of the lace shorts i bought from retailer last year that i loved so much. sadly, no. first of all they run small. i am between a s and xs in most brands, bought a s in these because i like my shorts on the looser side. these felt a little snug and short, but i decided to keep them. the first time i washed them, they were ruined. i followed the directions exactly and even put them in a lingerie bag in the washer, plus a delicate cycle, no dryer. the lace is man",1
I bought this jacket in white specifically for summer. it is the perfect weight for the office air conditioning coolness. i wore this jacket with a sleeveless silk blouse and summer skirt. it just looked perfect for a dressier summer outfit. i take a m/l in retailer jackets and went with the large in this because i have a large bust (36d). the medium fit but was just a tad snug through my upper back/front area. the large gave me a little wiggle room so i could wear a little heavier blouse undernea,5
"If you have any curves, avoid! it is not flattering.
the striped side panels look odd with the flow of the dress.",1
"This sweater is so much cuter than the online picture makes it look! i think the model is wearing it too large. anyway, this runs kind of big, so size down. it's kind of short in the front, but it hits at a nice, flattering spot. love it.",5
"Well made, versatile dress. have already worn it to a wedding and work - could definitely be dressed down for a more casual look. i'm 5,7 and typically wear a medium in dresses and the small was definitely the right fit with some room to spare.",5
"Has anyone tried to hand wash this dress instead of dryclean?
runs a little large. i am 5'5 135# 34dd and purchased xs. i was really surprised that xs fits well. i initially tried small but the armholes were too big. the waist is a little too high but i plan to wear it with a belt.",5
"I bought this dress online after a long search for the perfect dress to wear to my daughter's fall wedding. i did not want something full length or too formal. after modeling several dresses for my boys this one got the thumbs up. i do love the design and that it is different enough from all the other mother-of-bride dresses out there. i will wear this with black nylons and wedges (since this wedding is in a meadow). i'm completely satisfied! for reference i am 45 years old, 5'10"", 160 lbs with",5
"I wasn't expecting to like this tank as much as i do because of the other reviews...i thought i would send it back if i didn't like it, i appreciate the design, fabric, and construction! i plan on wearing it out to dinner with some friends coming in from out of town tomorrow night...can't wait!",5
"The dress didn't look like much on the hanger but the rust color caught my attention so i tried. the dress fits beautifully. i did have to size down to a small because the medium was too large on my frame. i have a longer torso and the elastic waist did not quite fall on my natural waist, but corrected by pairing with an obi belt, which looks fantastic. the bottom is lined and flows rather nicely. the dress has a modified hi/low thing going where the front and back are longer than the sides, but",5
"This dress is super comfortable. it's s bit long, but i'm 5'3"", so that's to be expected. i wanted an everyday dress and i can't decide if the full skirt makes it too formal looking.",5
"Wearing this to a weeding in july. its so feminine and pretty. runs a little big on top at the arm holes, but having it tailored - love!!!!",5
"I am a size 2 and the skirt fit however it is so thick and voluminous, it looked like a pirate sack. it's unfortunately going back.",1
"This is my new favorite dress! it's super soft, comfortable, and flattering! i have worn it twice and each time have received multiple compliments. i love, love, love it!",5
"This dress is beautiful. i ordered this in the mail and literally said ""wow"" when i took it out of the packaging. the color looks more like champagne in person and the flowers look fantastic on it. i was worried that it might look a little awkward with so many things hanging off, but instead the flowers really compliment the entire ensemble. it really just looks like a work of art. i'm usually a small in retailer clothes and that size fits me very well. i absolutely love this dress.",5
"Truly. adorable. as other reviewers have mentioned, much better in person than as pictured. the ivory has black, khaki and light pink polka dots. it is great with a pencil skirt or pants.",5
"I was desperate to find a dress for an upcoming wedding. i basically tired on every dress in the store. this one was by far the best dress i tried on. the outer layer is delicate, and has great stitching and embroidery. the only problem is that the slip is skin tight and too small. this dress is so awesome i'm willing to overlook that and find my own slip. when i came out of the dressing room another couple stopped to tell me how amazing the dress looked. this dress is beautiful!",5
"I ordered this online, having never seen it in person. i loved it as soon as i touched the soft material. it fits me perfectly...i almost invariably wear a size 6 in retailer dresses and tops, which gave me the confidence to order online, and this dress is true to size. the detailing at the bosom is so flattering. the fabric is supple and hangs gracefully without clinging to my not-so-perfect waistline. i have worn this twice already, having received it only a week ago. the blue/black combi",5
I love this sweater! timeless--classical with an edge! i will have it until the end.,5
I'm writing because i ordered this dress and live it. i'm usually a medium but bc so many said it ran small i ordered a large...it was huge and i wear a 34d. it was huge everywhere. so now hoping the medium fits.,5
"J brand is by far the best premium denim line retailer sells! the fit on these jeans is amazing..worth every penny..also, considering it is a crop jean - warm weather wear - the denim weight is light and not too thick...the color is different from ordinary regular denim blue..lighter wash for spring/summer!",5
"Quality, length, size, design are all perfect! i'm sometimes a picky person, but i can't say one thing less about this cardigan. it's all wool, but it feels so soft and comfortable. and it doesn't wrinkle. i put it in my purse for a couple of hours, still great when taken out. thin, but don't you plan to wear something underneath? it goes with everything!",5
"This kimono is absolutely wonderful. i originally purchased it for an upcoming beach vacation, but have also found it to be a great piece for my wardrobe in both hot and cold weather! goes with pretty much everything. highly recommend.",5
"I actually saw angela from the tv show bones wearing this dress and decided i loved it so much i had to find out where it was from! after ordering this dress i couldn't be happier, i love it! it is a very flattering shape and a thick material so it falls nicely.",5
"I found this dress to run true to size. i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs and the xs fits great. perfect length and i like the thicker fabric so it's not see through. the raw edges lend a cool laid back and the final embroidery is a perfect bohemian touch. wearing mine with a turquoise choker. awesome dress!",5

"Not sure who named this dress, but it isn't a swing dress. it's a beautiful dress out of very soft fabric, with elegant embroidery design and pretty fringe detail. and pockets! i've worn this dress with tennis shoes, leather flip flops, and heels and been complimented each time. love this dress!",5
"I love this cardigan, it is very soft, and unique (i am a sucker for polka dots). i tried on my usual size (xs) and it fit. i wish they did have it in petite, however. added this one to my wish list :-)

soft, versatile.",5
When these cords went on sale i bought a 2nd pair. they are great work week pants (i teach) - comfortable and machine washable. the fit is relaxed-trouser,5
I'm not sure why the other reviewers think that this runs small. in my opinion it runs pretty large. i am normally a medium and i ended up returning the medium to get the small. i do have a small bust (36b) and skinny arms so maybe that's why? regardless it is super cute and i think it can be dressed up or down. it looks awesome with the pilcro jean jacket!,5
"I tried this on in the store and came online for the petite size. the length was fine on me, it's only the sleeves that would be better for me in petite. this cardigan is very cute. the dots are a bit more arty-looking in ""person"" than you can see here - more like watercolor or ink spots, which is a nice subtle touch. i put ""runs small"" just because i think you might want to size up if you plan on wearing much in the way of layers underneath. the merino wool is not itchy, it is nice and soft. i",5
"I absolutely love this light, soft cardigan. i don't think the pic does it justice. the black longer blouse takes away from it. i wore it to work with a white button down and received so many compliments. only wish it came in additional colors.",5
"I'm sure there's someone out there who will look good in this but it certainly wasn't me. admittedly, i'm a less than ideal body type at a curvy 5' tall. still for a taller person this shirt runs short, for a curvy person this does nothing to accentuate a waist, for a short person this pattern is very busy even if the colors are beautiful, for a busty person the gathers around the chest make for a very frumpy look, and even for a short and thin person this shirt runs too big to get a good fit. c",1
Couldn't resist the polka dots! very cute and stylish cardi. since i'm short waisted this cropped style is perfect for me. i tried on the xs and small and while there wasn't a huge difference i went with the small since it had a bit more room. it's pricey so i waited for a sale to purchase!,5
This tops is super cute and great transitional shirt for the fall. a little short in the front but still a great shirt.,5
Great fitting longer tee. comfortable and light. longer short sleeve a nice change from cap sleeves.,5
"I have been looking for a black dress for a few events i have coming up this winter and have not been able to find anything suitable! i have tried a few things from free people but being 5'8"", everything there is just too short for these particular events. when i saw this dress, i had to have it! it has the same feel as some of the free people dresses but the length is so much better! the dress itself is sheer and not intended for extended outdoor wear, but really beautiful on. dress up with som",5

"I loved this dress and wanted to use it for work. i read the reviews and saw all the issues with the slip and was nervous, but i tried it anyway and figured i could use another plain black slip i have if the one with the dress didn't fit. i'm really happy i did because it's a gorgeous dress. you just may need to wear a different black slip with it (i did). if you already have one, it's no additional hassle or cost and the dress is really unique. it's the perfect comfortable but stylish dress for",5
Very nice polka-dot pattern. i so think it is versatile and can go with a lot of different colors. i am worn it was different colors underneath and both a skirt and jeans. it is a timeless classic!!,5
"I love this dress. so simple yet beautiful. very excited to wear this spring and summer, perfect for easter.",5
"I adore this blouse. the colors are vibrant (see my photo below). this is one of my favorite purchases from retailer. the top is light weight. true to size. i ordered a petite small and am 5 feet tall 120 lbs. and curvy. i left it untucked and loose like in the photo and it was very flattering. i disagree about it being frumpy. i wore it with kelly green retailer brand slacks paired with the retailer yellow sweater coat with white piping, and the retailer moss suede cross bag and neutral color (nude) fl",5
"These pants are perfect for any casual occasion. they can be worn to run errands, hang around the house, or even go out with friends. i love how versatile they are and they are so roomy for those times when you don't want to wear jeans or anything tight. they are a bit pricy, but i'm very happy with how they fit.",5
"I love this cardigan. i purchased it in the cream color. however, it did fray a bit after washing it. other than that, i think it was a great buy though!",5
So comfortable-so versatile-so perfect,5
"This top is light and airy, but substantial enough to wear with shorts away from the beach. its definitely not too sheer to wear without a bathing suit. i was actually pleasantly surprised at the flattering fit. it runs slightly big, but the top is fitted enough that its not shapeless. the colors are beautiful and the embroidery makes it special.",5
"I absolutely love these pants! they are super comfortable, lightweight, have big pockets, and are so cute. can wear them anywhere- i'm taking mine to india next week!",5
"This is much prettier and beautiful in person.
the fabric is light - but it's perfect for the summer",5
"I've been desperate for a swim cover that covers my arms & back. this one fits nicely--just a pretty, feminine, happy summer top that still lets me be leggy. i can't see them in the photos, but the embroidery detail at the upper part of this top has little mirrors sewn among the dots. very fun! i'm 5'5"" and when i paired this with jean shorts, everything below the crotch was visible--so perhaps slightly shorter than it appears in the pics.",5
"I just bought these last week and have had a hard time wearing anything else! they are super comfortable, with great pockets. very flattering and wash up great. wish they made more colors...",5
"Unique vest: modern, chic. i especially like the color block one the collar part. i know it will become a staple in my working clothes, and i can also see it blend in to my weekend clothes. i don't think the back of this vest is of bad quality, like another reviewer said. overall it's a hight-quality piece.",5
"This top wasn't an eye catcher off the bat but i love nothing more than a dressed up tee, so it's why it made it to the dressing room with me. it has elbow length sleeves, a slub texture, super soft, awesome texture and detail. the slight v-neck is perfect and the overall fit is great. i'm typically a lover of black but the wine color was gorgeous too so i took both into the fitting room with me (the other colors weren't available). surprisingly, the black was not even close to a favorite, but t",5
"I bought the green, and it is a dark teal. the fabric is so soft and it can be dressed up or down. the detail truly sets it apart from your boring tee. great purchase, especially at the sale price.",5
"The shirt fits loosely, but not baggy. beautiful detail on the back and shoulders. very soft and lovely material.",5
"Love the fit - doesn't cling to my midsection and detail on sleeves is very pretty. fits true to size.
i got the black but want to order it in other colors as well. can be dressed up or down.",5
I love this tee! i bought the teal in store. rich colors. little details are perfect. the loose got was very flattering on me. i'm not busty at all and it hung so well. wore it to brunch and the flight home later!,5
"I couldn't decide between the black and the red. this is a really cute dress that could be dressed up or down. just be aware of the high, somewhat tight neck.",5
Love this top - it's flattering and perfect for a casual dinner out or running around on a saturday afternoon. super comfortable and very cute.,5
"This top is perfect for a weekend casual look. you will love this, it fits true to size.",5
"This dress is adorable! i purchased it in black and white to wear to my daughter' s bridal shower. i received so many compliments. it was comfortable, stylish and best of all wrinkle free. i actually ordered it online and when i got it, the dress required no ironing of any kind. love it! i think i may have to get in in the red also.",5
"I just purchased this adorable, unique looking sweater at my local retailer store and absolutely love it. as soon as i saw it, i knew i had to have it! it is super soft, tts so i purchased it in my regular size small and it has the cutest pockets ever. the little black buttons also add to the look but the black snails on the pockets are what's really so sweet on this one. though i'm not a fan of snails in my garden, i'll make an exception for a couple of them making a guest appearance on this swea",5
This is a nicely made and comfortable sweater that is fun to wear. i have worn it with jeans and a t shirt and have received compliments on it.,5
"I was looking for something for a spring wedding that wasn't too billowy, but not overly fitted either as i try to hide leftover postpartum pounds. this offered the perfect solution with the slip underneath the looser netted overlay (i got the black). the overlay is not delicate, but not stiff either - just good quality that falls beautifully. so happy with this dress - comfortable, attractive, unique...and versatile! can easily see wearing this to work as well as a wedding :)",5
"It's a very light material, so you can wear it early spring or early fall when it's still fairly warm. such a cute jacket, has no zipper or buttons though, so definitely more for style/look than for a crazy rainy day use! love it!",5

"Cozy, soft fabric.  love the snails on the pockets and the cute buttons.  size down if you want a more tailored fit.",5
"I ordered the green/teal in size xl. the fit on me doesn't match the model. it looks looser on her. i think it runs small, at least in size xl. it still is a comfortable fit since the material has stretch. the pleat at the top helps the drape of the shirt. it's a beautiful color of green too. i think the v-neck is too low so i wear a tank underneath. this also helps with the transparent panels at the shoulders/back. my other dolan tops have held up well and retained their color through washing s",5
"I fell in love with this top as soon as i tried it on; it's the perfect spring-to-summer top. the fabric is light and airy, and the brown stripes give it a lackadaisical vibe. the little buttons on the back are a cute detail that really give something extra to an otherwise simple top, and the v-neck did not reveal any cleavage. i bought this in a large, and i'd say it runs a little on the larger side, but i like that because it adds to the comfortable, flowy nature of the design. for reference,",5
"I ordered this top in the white and cream color combo and love it so much. the buttons in the back add a sweet touch - easy top for fall, spring (easy to throw a cardigan over), and summer. i ordered a medium, but probably could have done a small. classic retailer!",5
"I love quirky and unique sweaters/ cardigans, and this is no exception. it's not obvious in the photo (at least it wasn't for me), but the cardigan does have buttons all the way down, and not just at the top, something i appreciated. those buttons, however, are not easy to un-button. the snails are adorable without being childish. i'm 5'4 130lbs, often between a small and medium when it comes to cardigans. i chose the medium for this one, which fit exactly how i wanted it to (a.k.a. sleeves were",5
"I like this sweater for its classic shape and grosgrain ribbon finish on the placket. it does have buttons all the way down and they are a little hard to open but the style is fun and fresh. it will dress up or down as shown with jeans and tee shirt. fit is like on the model for me in a large as i usually wear a 10-12 on top. the arms are quite long even for me at 5'9"".",5
"This sleep is super flattering on but it runs quite small (and short). it has a lot of stretch to the fabric and my normal size felt like i had a large spanx slip on. like i said, great slip but i'd recommend ordering up a size if you want it to look like the model.",5
"I'm not usually a fan of tees as i'm a little but busty, and don't like material that clings. the color of this tee is gorgeous, though. the neckline is feminine, and it has it enough weight that it moves.
not sure how it'll wash, but will try to keep it out of the dryer.",5
"If you look closely at the photos, the buttons are only shown as applied halfway down the placket but the buttons run the entire length of this fabulous sweater by moth. the sweater fits tts; i am 5'5"" 142 lbs and the m is just perfect with room to wear more than an average tight fitting tee underneath. it is a mid-weight nylon-viscose-cashmere knit with understated black cotton 'rope' snails on the pockets. there's nothing boring about it as is often the case with long-sleeved, navy blue cardig",5
"Very pretty dress, perfect style for my build, bigger busted, muffin top. the material/pattern is really pretty.",5
This is my go to top during the not so cold winter days.. can't be dressed up or down..,5
This top is just adorable! so comfy and cute. i love the cut and how it goes a little longer in the back. i will be wearing this a lot!,5
"I have been having the worst trouble lately finding cute, comfortable cotton undies...until i found these. these fit like a charm, are incredibly soft, and don't ride up at all. (sizing in spot on.) plus they have the adorable lace trim that makes one feel nice and girly. last summer there was a nyt article saying that comforable underwear was coming back in style -- yay!!",5
"I tried this on in the burgundy color in the store, and hoping it goes on sale soon! the fabric is not too thin like some of their tops. i run the gamut in retailer sizes , but lean towards mediums. this top fit beautifully in a small! it drapes nicely and doesn't hug the body, nor is it too flowy, looking maternity-ish. i am 5'4"" 140 and 34dd for reference . it looks like it will hold up well and the bit of lace makes it dressy casual. if it doesn't go on sale soon i might have to get it anyway b",5
"This is adorable! light and breezy. i felt it fit true to size leaning on the smaller size of a true fit. i am normally an xs/s and went with the small, fitting as it does on the model. it's a lightweight 100% cotton. not a lot of give. the v has a tendency to pull and probably will need a securing stitch. which was obvious when it arrived from another store. :(. i think wearing it with a cami is a great option considering it is flowy on the bottom and it is a thin cotton. overall great summer t",5
"Lovely top that seems to flatter all body types. fit is great, fabric is soft, style is lovely...great to dress up or throw on with jeans.",5
"The blouse is lightweight and is double layered, meaning a light layer over a lower layer. it's not bulky and not super flowy...just enough. i'm 5'1, a bit busty, and generally wear a m in retailer and this blouse fit great. it's figure flattering and not boxy. may be a tad short for taller women.",5
"The print and style of this dress is pure 60's. so fun! the black and white is especially striking. normally, i would wait a bit until the weather warmed up a bit more, but this dress is so cute and flattering, i just couldn't wait. the outer layer is actually sort of an open mesh. it's not extremely delicate, but could snag if you're not a bit careful. however, its the fabric that really makes it stand out so it's well worth it. i'd say the fit is true to size except if you're busty. i normally",5
"I do love sheath dresses and this one is very adorable!
true to size and nice length.
the black and white is kind of a throwback to the 60s flower power era and really cute.
nice weight so feels substantial not the flimsy wrinkly type material; more like a crepe.
very nice!",5
"Wow this is huge! i'm all for the tent-look with the right style, but this was absurd. i could have fit two of me into the width, and with the peplum style, extra width doesn't flatter anyone. the fabric is also so thin that it doesn't hang nicely, it kind of floats around the body. if you want a wide top, then this is perfect, but if you wanted something that hangs nicely, look elsewhere. i purchased a petite s, my typical size.",1
This is a classic! not only is it reminiscent of a fun 60's swing dress but the perforated outer layer over a solid shift creates this modern edge to a reto style!!! love it!,5
"I liked this top so much that i purchased it in two colors: green and wine. the top and colors are exactly as pictured online, the material feels great, and they fit nicely. the fit was true to size.",5
"This tunic is wonderful, wash & wear - comfortable and classic - love the trim. 

many compliments on this top.",5
"This top is cute and comfortable. i did order a size larger than i would normally wear. i usually wear a size small but i had to buy a medium (5'7"", 145lbs, 34b).",5
Love this sweater! i almost passed it up on-line because i didn't notice the snails. the sweater is navy and the snails are black. they are so cute and such a fun and unique little accent. the material is a moderate to light-weight sweater. the length was perfect. i have inadvertently purchased a bunch of cropped sweaters this year - this one is not cropped - yay!! the sleeves are actually a bit on the long side. i sized up a little with the idea of wearing it over long sleeved tops. i am typica,5
"This sweater is way cuter in person. the picture online does not really show the adorable contrast of the snails to the rest of the sweater. also, it looks like they photoshopped out the fact that the buttons run the whole length of the front. really cute and soft (not itchy). highly recommend",5
"It runs large but thats okay, its great quality and super super soft! i love the way it makes you feel so comfortable. very disappointed the clip fell off.",5
"I bought this during a 20% off sale which made it even more worth the price. i would have purchased and kept it regardless, but just got lucky.

looking at the pictures online, i thought the coat was going to be red. however; when it showed up it is more purple. i still like the color and did end up keeping the coat.

i do think the buttons are sewn on well, but i was surprised it did not come with additional buttons in case one gets lost. these are very unique buttons so i can't imagine it woul",5
Seafolly is my favorite brand in swimwear. i've collected a few over the years. i was so happy to find this print. the little umbrellas are so cute and fun. i am normally a size 8 in seafolly and this one ran true to size.,5
I love this dress! i wore it to my friends bridal shower and got so many compliments! i can't wait to wear it again!,5
"I purchased this pretty printed dress as soon as i spotted it on-line and ordered it in my usual size petite 6 (i'm 5'4"" 34d-27-35) and found it fit me tts and looks just perfect on. i immediately adored all the different prints on this one, the length, the sweet sleeves and waist band and think this will look so adorable with a jean jacket paired with a cute pair of boots this coming fall amd winter. it's a great transition piece that also looks really cute with sandals or clogs as well. also,",5
"I was very excited when this top arrived in the mail! it is so, so beautiful. i love the material and the brightness of the colors. it will be a perfect top this holiday season.",5
"I tried this dress at a store today and ended up ordering it online. i tried the red which is a beautiful, vibrant color. i wasn't sure how it looked on my skin tone though (pale like death), so i ordered the black. i do believe it runs small in the chest and shoulders. i am normally a size 4 in shirts, but the buttons were straining over my chest and my shoulders felt constricted. i tried the 6 and it was plenty roomy. for reference, i am a 32c with athletic shoulders. overall...

"This is such a cute dress, and i don't know why know one has reviewed it yet. its different and fun, i have worn it to work once and have gotten several compliments on it. i found that it does run a bit short so i wore it with leggings.",5
"I bought this dress after eyeing it up for weeks - it's really stunning. the red is incredibly vibrant, especially for linen, and the construction is very high-quality. since it's linen, it feels crisp and light, and you can layer it up nicely with a pullover or roll up the sleeves for flat-out hot days. the rayon slip is a really nice touch, too, since the linen is fairly transparent. it really drove home the sense of quality for me. i bought mine in size 0-regular, which i found slightly big i",5
"So i tried this on in the store and ended up with the size 8 (almost could have gone with a size 6) even though i'm 135lbs 5'6"" and 34 c. the dress is beautiful! the color is exactly as pictured - brilliant red. the linen is nice and summery. it does make it billow just a tad in the back because of the fabric but not anything to complain about. if i could change just one thing on this dress it would be the length. it just feels a little short for being such a classic and classy dress; just needs",5
"Love the suit! i ordered two sizes, and this 6 ended up being too small. i'm 35x27x36 and 34d, and there wasn't enough support in the bust. read a lot of mixed reviews regarding sizing on the seafolly suits, so i'm glad i got two. suit is flattering and i love the coverage in the bottom. some boyshort suits are ""cheeky,"" but these are not like that. only complaint is that while there is a pocket for the cups, they are sewn on top.",5
"Dress is made from a light-weight linen and is lined with a separate slip. high quality with nice details and tts. sleeves are average length. length of dress feels appropriate on my 5'8"" frame. hook-and-eye closure at chest area to keep buttons aligned is a quality detail. i think this is a lovely dress that can go from work to play.",5
I am 9 months post baby and still have some body self-confidence issues. i am just not ready nor do i think i want to ever wear a two piece again so i was looking for something that was still made me feel attractive. this swimsuit does the trick. makes me chest looks awesome and my tummy super flat. love this suit!!!,5
"This dress is a potato sack! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird!! and it's huge on me, so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not. also the fabric is strange, not at all what i expected. i'm so sad :( i was really excited about this dress.",1
I am 5'3 and tried this dress on in both a large and medium petite. the dress is supposed to be a lose fit but i found that i was swimming in the large but the medium was perfect. i bought it in a petite which is shorter for my comfort to wear alone but looks great with leggings and sandals for spring or with boots in the winter. the embroidery is beautiful plus it has pockets. first time i wore it i received tons of compliments.,5
"I've been stalking this suit online for months and i saw it in store yesterday. i never knew what size to order because of the australian sizing. i went with my pants size (8) and it looks great. i carry my weight in my butt and thighs and the boy legs are flattering! i found the size up (10) was loose in the bust for me. go for it, it's the cutest suit ever.",5
This dress runs a bit small in my opinion. for reference i'm a 36/38 c and usually a 10. the medium is tight at the bust. the material is beautiful but it looks like a petite cut on me. the sleeve and overall length are too short and i'm going to return it.,5
"I had the seafolly garden suit last year (same cut) and loved it. i decided the light blue color didn't look great on me so i decided to get this one. i found that the garden suit was cut smaller than this umbrella print one. right now i'm a 10 m and got the 12 in this, just like last time. i probably could've gotten the 10 but i'll keep the 12 for comfort. note: the leg holes are not tight and do not make upper thighs/butt squish out like you might imagine. try this suit!",5
"Love this gorgeous fox skirt. i typically wear either a size 4 or 6 depending on cut. i bought the small and it fit perfectly. i wore it with a black turtleneck sweater and black tights/boots. other colored tops would work, as well, due to the various flower colors around the fox - pink, yellow, blue, white or brick red. i'd prefer it to be a little warmer/lined.",5
"I love this tee, the fabric is very comfortable and the v-neck is not too deep for petites!",5
"I wore this dress yesterday and was complemented wherever i went and asked where i purchased the dress. i love the linen and the back of the dress is so flattering. i ordered a medium and could have gone with a small, which i usually never wear, so i would order a size smaller.",5
"I love everything about this dress. it is comfortable, classic, good quality and fits really well. there are two layers to the material so nothing is see through.the styling on the back is to die for. there is a subtle gold line that runs through the blue and white stripes. the first day i wore this i received 5 compliments while shopping in a single store!

it is a bit loose in the middle, but i paired it with a skinny belt and it was the perfect fix. i can usually wear petite or regular. i p",5
"I purchased this dress in my regular size xs. i'd come across it several times at my local store but never thought much of it to try it on. . when i saw it was on sale i decided to take a chance. boy was i surprised. the dress is really beautiful.. the hints of gold reflect nicely.. the dress is comfortable and loose yet flattering. i received so many compliments on it. i am 5'1"" and the regular length worked for me.",5
I was using my daughter's dress and ended up buying myself one as well. it is a versatile casual dress... very flattering. (and my daughter and i have different builds) i actually wish that they sold this in more colors.,5
I've gotten many compliments with this delightful dress. colors ar light and just right for a summer day. so comfortable and has a nice inner lining. very light and comfortable.,5
"I saw this dress several times and never try it. then i finally put it on. omg, i love it! it does run large. i am usually medium. but the small size is perfect on me i visually like the blue color. but the orange one is cuter on me. the length is great. i am 5'4''. it's right to my lower ankle. so i don't need to wear heel. the quality is very good. it's a great weekend dress.",5
"I am petite and curvy and usually need a dress with a seamed waistline, so i was a bit hesitant in ordering this when it went on sale, but i trusted the other reviewers who said it was flattering to women with curves. they were right! the way it's seamed vertically at the waist makes up for the lack of horizontal seaming and the result is that it's incredibly flattering. the fabric is light enough for warm weather, though it may be too heavy for hot weather. it's soft and has a very flattering n",5
"I was very impressed upon receiving this dress. i'm 5'3, 102lbs and ordered xs. fit perfect. i am also a 32dd, so if you are smaller than a d or big c, the top portion might be a little big for you. love how it is lined so you could technically wear without a bra. i bought the tangerine and have gotten many complements.",5
I love the cut of this dress! i have to be honest and say that i initially bought the blue color at the store and after falling in love i decided that i deserved to have the mango colored one as well after seeing my sister in it! the sizing is just a tab big but it works for the design. so i would say stick with your usual size. amazing pop of color especially for summer. the back design is gorgeous and the gold streaks running through it  are wonderful. do yourselves a favor and just try it on!,5
"The back of this dress is stunning. i am usually a petite but could get away with regular. tried on xs (115 lbs, 30dd chest) and it was good length and not too low cut. colors are really fun, the mango one has a tiny bit of sparkle in one of the lines. flory and airy.",5
"I love these pants so much and have worn them so many times in a week! they are comfy and causal, but still chic and presentable. these pants run true to size and are great for so many things- running errands, working out, lounging around, being casual and cool, etc., etc, etc! after buying these on sale, and loving them, i knew i needed more and purchased two more pairs. i definitely recommend these for anyone who wants both comfort and style.",5
"I wore these pants for the first time yesterday to two parties. before anyone asked for my name, they complimented me on the pants. my husband loved it, my friends loved it, and people i didn't know loved it. it's worth every penny i paid for it. i bought these pant to bring on my trip to italy later this summer.",5
"I did not have the issue that a previous reviewer did, there were ruffles on my shirt. the one thing i didn't know was how wide the top ran. i ordered my usual size 8 and it fit with no problems. i'm a 36b. the only thing is that in the model shot, the shirt is tucked into the pants and you don't get to see the full volume of it. even the model shot of the shirt from the back doesn't show the wide sleeves and body of the shirt. its not a big problem, since the shirt can be tucked but i will have",5
"Great, flattering fit, lovely light fabric, classy with an edge. getting another one the other color! stripes on the taupe one are navy -",5
"I am a shorter woman (5'3"") and typically a size large. i purchased this dress in a large. it is flattering and fits well. good length as well.",5
"I absolutely love everything about this top! i got compliments the first time i wore it. i do not find the fabric to be sheer at all, but perfectly lightweight for the heat of summer. the neckline and sleeves seem tailor-fitted for my body. i don't often think much about sleeves but these sleeves are the perfect length/shape to be incredibly flattering. they're in a sweet spot somewhere in between a cap sleeve and regular-length. the neckline is equally perfect and hugs my curves beautifully wit",5
"This is a great dress that looks better in reality than it shows on the website. the style is very flattering, fitting snug at the waist with just the right amount of flare. i am 132 pounds, 34dd and i bought a size 8 and it fit great. the material is soft and flowing and the cut was true to size for me. the first time i wore it a woman walked across the restaurant to tell me how much she loved my dress. this one is a keeper.",5
"I bought these in white (not a harsh white, more soft-looking), and am very pleased with them. they are true to the manufacturer's sizing (i own another pair of pants from elevenses in the same size), which runs somewhat large (i'm 5' 5"" tall, weigh 135 pounds, and the size 6 fit perfectly). the back of the waistband is elasticized, so there's some give. they're long enough on me that they hit the floor; with heels, they're perfect. they look as pictured, but what you can't tell from the photo i",5
"This dress fit perfectly and as i am a bit curvy the style compliments my figure. it is a bit fuller in the bottom than the photo looks. also, i am 5'4"" and it is a right to the bottom of my knees which is also very complimentary.",5
"I first tried this dress in my usual size 4, and thought it was a pretty fabric but boring and not particularly flattering.  i later read the positive reviews and the next time i was in the store i tried it in a 2, and it was so much better!  very pretty shape.  uiu might want to size down because the shoulders were set a little wide apart and bodice was gapping in my usual size.  for reference, i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs.",5
"Twirly full skirt!
me: 5'6"", 130lbs, 34/35a-28-36. tried and pictured the size 6, a perfect fit with a bit of give in the bust for a larger cup size.
i'm not particularly curvy and i felt this added a waistline to me, i think this is an almost universally flattering cut.
material was soft and an easy wear.
simple enough that i think it will wear for quite a few years.",5
"I love this tee. i am long waisted and so many tops right now that are on the shorter side look silly on me so i was happy to find this. i'm 5' 5"" 118, 34b and bought and xs. it fits perfectly. the asymmetry is darling and the stripes are perfect for spring. it is a nice weight and i felt totally worth the money. it looks great so far after three washes and hang dries.",5
"So versatile
i tried this on in my usual regular 0, but it was way too long at the shoulders, large in the bust(i am 32b), and a tad too long overall. i ordered the 0p and it fits perfectly! can wear this year round and looks great with or without a belt. pockets would have made it even better, but still love it.",5
"The picture does not do it justice. this dress is beautiful on. it is fitted on the top and flares on the bottom. it is also a very soft denim. the person helping me at the store brought a sparkly belt that made it even more spectacular. truth is it looks great with or without the belt. it fits true to size (5'4"", 135 lbs and 34c and my usual size 2 was great).",5
"I bought this on sale and absolutely love it. i bought the xs, i'm 5'10, 145 lbs and a b/c cup and it fit well. i am considering sewing in cups, since i don't like using stick-on bras as much and none of my other bras work with the back. that really is my only complaint about the dress, everything else is great!",5
"I was on the fence about another patchwork design peasant inspired blouse, but once i tried this on i fell in love. it drapes beautifullly, is not too short, and just feels pretty. for reference i am 5 feet 6 inches, 140 lbs. 36b and usually wear a medium in tops. the medium fits and flows perfectly, hiding all my mature woman problem areas.
i purchased quite a few items on the 40% off sale, and this is one of my top favorites. i love the versatility, just gorgeous for casual wear or dressy.",5
Love these pants. very flattering. not much stretch. the rear waist band is elastic with minimal stretch and not visible to others. they are long but wearable with the right heels.,5
I just wore these and they were comfortable and didn't stretch our or become baggy throughout the day. i have three kids and am constantly moving. they're a nice in between weight and held up nicely. i have some from j.crew that stretch out and become baggy in the knees and backside and these didn't do that. i usually wear an 8/10 and i purchased a medium and they fit well. i would say that run a little big though.,5
"I picked this maxi up in navy to go with my summertime capsule wardrobe that i will be doing extensive travel with this summer. this dress is well made and fits my frame in a size m perfectly (5'4, 125lbs, 34c). it is substantial enough to disguise any backside indiscretions and the halter style front does not expose the girls. i do wear petals with this dress to ensure that i don't put on a show especially in air conditioned rooms. this launders easily and doesn't look rumpled and wilted after",5
Not tissue thin like most tees and easily can be dressed up to wear to work in a casual setting. i find myself reaching for this tee weekly! have every color! i usually avoid stripes however this tee seems to flatter and slim! love!,5
I absolutely loooove this skirt! its just as depicted. super comfy and warm. got tons of compliments wearing it. its just adorable. the colors are really rich and the design if the skirt made it avery flexible to wear with different styles of tops and sweaters. highly recommend!!,5
"This print combination is like an arts and crafts wallpaper sampler, and is simply beautiful. size down and tuck it in for the best look, but wear a high-waist bottom with it, since it runs a bit short.in the torso.i didn't find the same transparency problem of which other reviewers complain.",5
"I am 70 years old and enjoy retailer so much for uniqueness.
this dress is not flattering in the photo..but.....
it is great on a curvy figure and i plan to wear it anywhere/everywhere i can....so flattering
from the bust to the smaller waist (though mine is definitely not small) but the skirt then
flares deligthfully. the fabric is not heavy, not too light ...just great.
easy going length...wear as is or add a crop, belt, etc....

again, the photo does not do this dress justice!!!!",5
"Gorgeous skirt. received so many compliments. the colors are perfect to match with many tops/jackets/sweaters....as well as different shoes/boots, bringing out the colors. i unfortunately ordered a large thinking it ran small and the large is too big in the waist so i will try to have it tailored. i like my skirts fuller in the hip area. i hope retailer offers more of this type of item. just adore it! for size i am a 8/10 in bottoms but since the skirt looked slim with out lining i ordered a large",5
I love love love this dress..it's a quality well fitting jean dress..that you can dress up or down..the top portion dies run small..so of you are busy you might want to stay away from this dress..,5

"I have never had a purchase go wrong at retailer, which is why i am was not hesitant to spend this much money on the blazer. however, the quality is very poor - it feels like it might fall apart after one clean. also, the buttons where not sewn on properly. i wear an xs and the size was a good fit, but the overall quality was not worth the price (or even close to it).",1
This dress has all the hallmarks of a classic. the fit of the bodice is form enhancing but modest and the flare is very feminine and swingy. i love the soft denim fabric though it smelled funny out of the package and i had to air it out. i am 140# 36dd and bought the size 8.,5
"I have always liked this look so ordered my usual size s. fit is good & looks pretty much on me as in the pic - even the arm length works - not too long. i don't care for the placement of the top buttons which are just cosmetic. they dangle downwards showing more of the loop than the button itself. placement is not directly over the bottom buttons, which puts it in the lower breast area. mmmmm... not the look i want. looks unattractive. if i keep this, i will have to move the buttons more in lin",5
"If you are curvy, this dress is for you. every details is flattering, from the seams to the fit-and-flare cut. true to size. this dress will easily cross seasons. love it!",5

i wear with a tank for casual, beach look; colorful silk top for a dressier look- very versatile. 

i just may have to buy this in the green. (i would get the white, but some reviews say they are pretty shear.",5
Fits perfectly! i don't think this is too long and i'm a shorty. great style -- wish it came in more colors - i would definitely buy again!,5
"I ordered this shirt in both white and coral. i absolutely love the design and coral color. the white was a bit see through, so i returned it. it would be cute with a cami under, but i just wanted something that did not require an extra layer. overall, it is a flattering fit and i love the detail on the back.",5
"I am obsessed with these jeans! i have them in 3 washes and hardly ever wear any of the other jeans in my closet now. they are truly the perfect skinny jeans. you can dress them up with heels and a cute top, or down with a slouchy sweater and boots, or even throw on with a simple tee and flats. i love that they are low rise, as i am short waisted, and often find the front rise too long on many styles. the backside is also super flattering, and the back pockets are the perfect size and shape...no",5
"Beautiful medium weight duster; it looks just like on line photos!
my store did not have this duster so i ordered on line. i usually wear a medium top, but sometimes a large.

i ordered this duster in xl because i like room in my cardigans; i could have gone with a large.
i have to roll up the cuffs of the sleeves, but i like to do that anyway.
this sweater duster is soooo soft and warm! so comfy! very stretchy with no closures on the front.",5
"I absolutely adore this top. the design on the front is super bright and beautifully done, so beware if you do not like bright colored patterns. i normally wear a size medium and bought a large in this shirt because of reading other reviews, i am glad i did so. i have broad shoulders and muscular arms, and i believe a medium would not have fit my arms and shoulders. however, it is a little boxy in the torso area because of the extra material. therefore, i feel a large feels like a medium in the",5
"Yes, $48 may feel like a lot to pay for a tshirt, but this is one is worth it -- i can wear this with *everything*! i bought this in grey, and the quality and style are just right to pair with a high waisted skirt or black skinny pants to wear out at night, or wear with regular jeans and a cardigan during the day. one of the best retailer purchases i've made in a while!",5
"Love this top, the flutter sleeves are really pretty and give the top a bit more pizzazz than just being a regular tee. it makes it easy to dress up or down. the length is great, not super long but not too short. i ordered a medium and it fits well, not tight and isn't baggy, the material allows it to float away from the body a bit and doesn't feel stretched over my belly :) or anything. nice silky weight.",5
I bought the mauve color and it's very pretty. i felt as though sizing up was a better choice. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small. i liked the length of the small better. the shoulders add a cute look to it.,5
"Cure pants --- just bought them ---
they look black but the description says ""blue motif"" - does anyone else have them and know
if they are black or blue?",5
"I bought the lavender in my normal large. the fabric drapes wonderfully and does not cling to my midsection. the texture of the fabric is much more interesting than the photos online show. there is beautiful shimmer tot he heather in the color. in my lavender shirt there is pink/gray/lavendar/white/silver depth to the fabric. i plan on getting at least two more colors. 

i recommend washing all shirts like this in a nylon bag in the machine, then line drying. i have done this for years with al",5
"Wow, this sweater is, as other reviewers have said, perfect weight and the colors are vibrant and will work well with fall colors! i'm 5'11"" so i'm always hoping the length works and in this case it does! i am very happy with this!",5
"Agreed that the pictures do not do this top justice. it's got shiny threads woven in the fabric and gives off an iridescent, colorful sheen. it can be dressed up or down, worn with a number of various styles - jeans, dress pants, skirts. the back adn arms are a tweed sweater knit, the front is an unforgiving acetate - dry clean only - hand wash will ruin this piece! i normally wear a small, but it was tight in the chest (34c) so i went with a medium and it worked fine.) no stretch in the acetate",5
"Very well made and comfortable with nice finishing touches and fabric. looking forward to wearing it many different ways either with jeans, pants or long dresses. i'm 5'1 and petite sizes were out of stock so i chose small regular which looks great, not too long so i won't have to shorten.",5
"I purchased this tee last week in white and love it! as soon as i saw that it was on sale i ran to get a price adjustment and to pick up a few more colors! i had every intention to grab up the blue today however i tried on four larges and all were cut way shorter than the other colors. i ended up purchasing the red which fits exactly as my white one does. perfect light weight, easy, but adorable tee for summer!",5
"Perfection. effortless cool, and the colors are much more vibrant and gorgeous in person. endless options. you know a sweater must be a dream if you end up buying it when it's still 90 degrees outside. runs true to size---the medium fit with room to layer underneath.",5
Bought all colors and each one is unique in its beauty. material is thicker than most thin tops today but not too thick for the summer. i wear size 12/14 and the xl fit with room to spare. i bought larger in case of shrinkage.,5
"It's thin, very. but i were a cute scrappy athletic type bra underneath and it's so cute!
it's a stink top, i pick a spot to tuck in around the from and let the rest flow.
aside from being a swing top, it runs large. i have 2 in xs and i'm a 34dd and i still have room.
i have it in faded red/pink and white and am buying blue too, love it!",5
"I didn't pay much attention to this shirt on the website...when i was in the store yesterday though, i grabbed the green color because it's so pretty! i went back home to see which shirt this was on the website and was surprised. the picture here really doesn't do it justice. it's very soft, has a beautiful and flattering necklace and the flutter sleeves hang nicely rather than puffing out (like snow white...which isn't my goal!). also, because the sleeves drape nicely, you could wear it under s",5
"I absolutely love this top. it can be worn with shorts or jeans, dressed up or down. it fits perfectly, i am broad on top so i ordered a large. i bought it in white..i wish they had more colors. love it.",5
I bought this top in every color. the fit is so flattering and just flows so nicely - not too big. love!,5
"I saw these in the store and was smitten. ordered online and have not been disappointed. love the pattern, the feel, and the fit. comfortable, fun and interesting. the regular length ones are definitely full-length on me but not too long. i might have gone with the petite length except that they didn't seem available, but am perfectly happy with the regular length.",5
If you are self conscious about your arms and want a tee that has style then this is the one. soft fabric with a flutter sleeve makes this top so flattering. i purchased the turquoise and will purchase other colors. it's flowy comfortable and a must have!,5
"These leggings were everything i expected them to be. they are well made, and the material is thick enough that i can wear them outside in the colder months of the year. the pattern on the website is accurate, and the waistband is comfortable and flattering. would definitely buy again!",5
"This top is very easy to wear. it's a great, versatile, and unique piece. the textile is really soft and i found, quite special. it is pretty lightweight and the sleeves have some great stripes of more sheer fabric.",5
I was fortunate to buy one of the last petite mediums in this style! the knit is soft and comfortable and doesn't seem likely to snag. there are a variety of stitches through the upper areas which add subtle differences. the colors are fantastic. this will be great for the cooler months. it looks fabulous with denim.,5
"This tee fits true to size, not oversized. the material is super soft and the colors are delicate. the armholes don't show your bra which is hard to find. nothing bad to say about this top except that my size was sold out in every color but lavender (which was lovely!).",5
"I am in love with theses! they are incredibly comfortable and flattering. i have an hourglass figure, and they hug my hips perfectly. they perfect for the gym, but also look great with a tunic and booties for fun weekend wear. good + pure are my new go to legging brand. i'm going to order the solid black and other patterns retailer has.",5
"On any given day, i can usually find tons of stuff i like at retailer, but every once in a while comes an item that is extra special.

it has adorable details, lovely print, fits beautifully and can't be found anywhere else. oh, and the quality is good. 

this top is it for me!

i love the print, and the sleeves remind me a bit of a kimono except that this top's fabric is smooth and flowy.

i tried the top in the store in a small, and i felt lost in the fabric (i am 5'4"", 115# and small on",5
Just purchased this on sale. will be perfect for summer on those days you wear dresses and don't want your skin to touch the subway bench! love it!,5
"This sweater is so unique. not for the faint of heart but it's beautiful. hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired. the colors are saturated, vibrant. love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back. the front material is slightly stiffer. i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i'm willing to overlook it. will be a great sweater for the holiday season. wear it with a skirt, jeans, skinny cargos. endless possibilities.",5
Adorable print! just picked these up in the store yesterday! the print is so pretty and it caught my eye! surprisingly they fit in my usual size for workout pants!,5
"I should have read the reviews first before ordering this top/!. ***buyers beware**: you will not get the same top delivered to you, as is shown in this picture. the top i got delivered does not have the little straps at all, and while there is a bow in the back, the back sides do not come together the same to form the bow. i hate to write a bad review, but come on retailer! i'd never expect this from you. it looks like any other peplum white top, not something special like the picture is o",1
"I don't normally write reviews, but i love this shirt!  it's sooo soft and hangs perfectly. not to mention it takes what could be a boring t-shirt and makes it anything but that with the cute flutter sleeves. it's beyond comfortable. i purchased one and went back immediately to get another! i can tell these will be some of my go-to tees. plus, they are a steal on sale!  i am 5'5, 135 and medium is perfect.",5
I bought this shirt in blue (because the store was out of gray and i had to have it right then) and it is my favorite. it is comfortable and durable. i also appreciate the length of the shirt. it is long enough for me to not worry about putting my arms up. it is an overall great buy. i want one in every color.,5
Cute shirt. i thought from the model that it would be big so sized down. it's more snug than i expected so will send back and re-order in normal size. might order 1 size up and compare.,5
"Really fantastic shirt. ordered multiple colors and will keep them all. the gray especially looks a bit boring online, but is gorgeous in real life. it has different shades mixed together and is really pretty. neckline is interesting. wish the front was a tad shorter, (i'm 5'4) but don't think petite will work. really, really great shirt.",5
These leggings are so comfortable and luxurious.  when i opened the package i knew i was in trouble.  they are comfortable and beautiful.  a perfect piece for any wardrobe.,5
"I adore a well made and well fit tshirt. t.la always delivers! this one is no exception. fun, swingy and light. the tie on back is a fun little addition and the length is perfect. i'm 5'9 and always prefer longer tops. the swing in this one gives it a great length. love the colors but decided to stick with basic white. i'd love this in black too! highly recommend!",5
"I first saw these in store, but decided to risk waiting for them to go on sale and no regrets! they are a great high quality and the print is exactly what i hoped it to be!",5
"The colors are really lovely--bright and vibrant. the sleeve and back fabric is comfortable and breathable. it is dry-clean only because of the brocade, but definitely worth it! i'm usually s but preferred the xs fit.",5
I loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on: a good cut--not too drapey or fitted. but then i washed it (laid flat to dry) and it shrunk so much that it's unwearable now. so disappointing.,1
"My favorite leggings. they are feminine and perfect with a long tee. the colors are vibrant, the material is high quality, plus they're comfy! i ordered an xs. i'm 5'4"" and 115 lbs.",5
Great sweater for any occasion. may be dressed up and/or worn with jeans. very versatile. love that it is short sleeves. size is true to fit.,5
I don't know why i never reviewed this beauty. i love the colors and pleats and contrasting embroidery. i'm busty,5
"This is a beautiful and comfortable top. the brocade front panel is a nice take on a traditional pattern but in bright colors with a metallic sheen. the knit sleeves and back are a stretchy, nubby complement. overall, a great piece and perfect for the holidays.",5
"This appealed to me online & it came in petite. during the promo in july i decided i shld order the petite small while they lasted although way too hot to even consider wearing until fall. glad i did. i am short & the regular length wld be a bit too long. great color & quality. not too thick or weighty. like that it's a cotton blend. will go well with the many skinny jeans/cords/leggings i have. love the blue. now i have to wait a few months to wear it! 5'3"", 117# & usually wear a size small in",5
"The colors on these leggings are very nice and the fit was fabulous. the waist is high enough to hold in a slight ""muffin"" top and the control in the fabric is just right. i received several compliments on them and hubby really liked them.",5
Love this top...bought in 2 colors...white and the orange. fun change to regular t-shirts....sized down because its flowy.,5
"These pants are just what i wanted to work out in- something bright, cheery, and feminine. they're super comfortable and fit perfectly. i'm typically a 2, so i ordered the xs, and they are just right.",5
"This is a beautiful sweater with vibrant colors. it is versatile and can be worn throughout the year, it runs true to size and has become one of my favorite sweaters.",5
"Love this top! i have it in the green and i am tempted to go and buy it in the other colors! it is a simple, but cute top that is easy and comfortable to wear. a little dressier than a plain tee.",5
"This caught my eye in the store because of the beautiful bell sleeves so i had to try it on. i tried on an xs and small to see what fit better. for me, i am 5""3' and about 120 lbs, the xs fit better. i usually do take an xs in tops. i wore it out recently with a pair of distressed jeans and it looked great. as with most of the items you see online it is always better to see it in person as the pictures do not do it justice. the material was nice and flowy. i did not feel the neckline was too low",5
"I purchased the blue (a bluish gray), size medium.

the entire top, including the fluttery sleeves, drapes wonderfully and is sooo soft. i wish i could wear this top/this silhouette every day! it's versatile enough to do so, if only the other colors were flattering to my coloring. 

sleeves: i'm thrilled to find a shirt that fits/flatters my proportional curves and sports sleeves that don't grip my biceps. often, i must choose to fit my arms or fit my torso, unless i want the additional step",5
"This tunic is amazing. i'm not usually one for turtlenecks but it's not too tight around the neck and very comfortable. i love the versatility, it can be worn with pants/leggings or a skirt,  you can layer it with a shirt or blouse underneath or throw a jacket over it.",5
"I was thrilled when this shirt arrived.  it is as cute in person as in the catalog.  it's soft, it fit perfect, and it looks great with shorts and pants.  it will be my ""go to"" shirt this summer.",5
I would describe as an upgraded t-shirt. a perfect flowy top that you can dress up or down. comfortable and soft material.,5
I ordered this top despite the other reviews and i'm very glad i did. it is adorable. well made and very flattering. i am usually a size xs or 00 but based on the reviews sized up to a 0. fits perfectly. not snug at all. highly recommend!,5
"These pajama pants are dreamy in all ways! incredibly soft, with a soft and not binding elastic waist. plus, the print is evocative.

i am 5'8"" and a size 2/4. i bought these in the store. the only size left was one pair of xs. sure enough they fit.

the length is perfect. 

i just ordered a pair for my sister.",5
Skirt has lots of stretch and comes up to waistline so i am not sure yet how i will wear it but tucked in or out it looks very stylish and the dark denim is of course slimming.,5
"I just purchased these pajamas on-line and they are very pretty in person. i found them to be tts in my usual size small though a bit on the long side as i'm only 5'4"". i don't mind a little extra length though because these are just to lounge/sleep in. i think these soft pj's will be great during the warmer months as they are very light weight and comfortable. you'll absolutely love the print on them and wish there was a matching top!",5
"Love this, it's a great update your basic tee!",5
"Love this t-shirt, its comfortable and very cute. it runs a little large i am 5'0 110 pounds and got a xs. 
the color is a little brighter than the picture.",5
The back of the shirt has a tag stitched in with red thread that goes through to the outside of the shirt. it is very visible and looks terrible - especially since the back is the focal point of the shirt. do not recommend,1
"I originally took a liking on the pink one, but my complexion indicated i'm better off with the gray one. this piece is so versatile that i am still able to wear it during my pregnancy (and post too!). this is a good investment.",5
"I got a small (5'9, 135lbs) and it fits great! it is super comfortable and also looks really good on.",5
"This tunic is just adorable. material is very soft and slightly stretchy and drapes so nicely with just the right amount of fullness without spilling into maternity territory. i got it in the pink color which is really a very beautiful rose color, perfect for spring. the tie back detail is so cute and adds a feminine touch.
fit is tts. i'm 5' 103 lbs 32b and i got it in an xxs regular which fits me perfectly. i was afraid it would be too long on me since there was no option for petite sizes in",5
"Love the lilac purple color, breathable yet not see through material is soft on your skin. i like the small detail cut out in the back, and a high bonus point for not showing your bra. one minor thing i would change is the length of the string in the back, but not a big deal.",5
"Made by dawn suits are the bomb. the bottom is a tiny bit cheeky, but not thong territory- just enough side leg to be seriously sexy. the quality is fantastic, soft with nude lining. love the retro feel to the high neck top- enough support even for my 36d's. so comfy, i forgot i was wearing it at lunch. the normal triangle tops cut into my shoulders/neck, and this style does not. amazing quality and well worth the price.
fyi- large top fit perfectly, but i needed a medium bottom.",5
"I just need to write a review on this sweater because it's the best!!! i currently own the cream/blue stripe sweater and have recieved many compliments. what i was most happy about it was the fact that i have washed it several times and the sweater looks like new and has held it's shape. i have ordered the gold one as well and it's still on backorder, waiting for it to arrive :) don't procrastinate, it's worth the price.",5
"The material on these is super lightweight but still strong, perfect for summer. so hard to find great lounge-sleep clothing in summer for a house without ac. 

illustrations are beautiful in person. i wish they still had more in stock, i want to buy for my mom!

also, i am tall and i like that they are long.",5
"I usually love tops like this, i bought this is the store because if was so soft. got it home and was so disappointed because it is not very flattering at all.would be a great house top though because it is soft enough to sleep in.",1
"After seeing this top in the catalog i also spotted it in the retailer store. the peach color is even more perfect in person and compliments my skin tone perfectly. the style of the top is unique and flattering. now that i see even more colors, i'll need to buy more. my one reservation is that the material is super soft but very thin, so i hope it doesn't get holes - i want to wear this one all summer!",5
"Love this sweater! warm, cozy and and not ordinary!!! fits great too! no surprises!",5
This is a great everyday top that is very versatile.,5
This dress is made very well and can be dressed up or down! it can be worn with open toe wedges in spring and summer and cute booties in the fall.,5
"The perfect fit and style of any jean ever. i order one size up in petites. i love these jeans and want them in every color/wash. they have wonderful stretch that does not sag. i wear them with cuffs folded up in hot weather but can also wear them down thanks to petite styling. love, love.",5
Simply lovely to look at because of the fringe detail and it's a joy to wear because it does not cling to my trouble spots.  very versatile as it can be worn and layered in many different ways.  i was lucky enough to buy this in petite but i'm sure the regular would've been fine.  looking forward to outfitting this because i got so much inspiration from instagram.,5
Cozy and beautiful - everything dreamy sleep pants should be. great for gifting. make bedtime feel a little more pampered.,5
"This tunic is overall very pretty with soft material and very comfy- not itching. the color is more like a taupe than what's shown on picture. i love it very much as the design is unique, romantic but also classic. it goes well with skinny jeans or black leggings.",5
"Bought this cardigan on a whim as a birthday treat pre myself! love it! i get a compliment everyone i wear it! the quality is great, fits great (with a roomy feel).",5
"This is a beautiful sweater. the photo doesn't do it justice. the model is wearing too large a size. i wear a l in moth and definitely looked better in the medium. the price is too high but the 25% savings thanksgiving weekend helps to blunt the pain. the lining is soft but was wrinkled on all the sweaters. the coloring is very flattering and, with care, this should be able to be worn for years. it can be used as a dressy coat sweater or fabulous over casual clothes. i wasn' particularly impress",5
"Bra s great, but it has a lot of push-up padding. this might be nice for smaller cup sizes, but for a 34dd, it was a little overkill/unnecessary.",5
"Just received these this morning and so happy. cartonnier always makes a substantial quality product. might run a little large,depends how roomy you want them, lovely colors and perfect length. wish they came in other colors.",5
It does run large. i got it on sale and it is a great sweater / coat for $200.00. i would not have paid the full price of 450.00 but i do love it. every time i wear it someone complements me.,5
"Love this jumpsuit, i was rather apprehensive as i didn't think it would look as good on me as on the model but i am totally smitten with it. very flattering, especially if you have some bumps and rolls. i ordered in a medium (5.7 and 145 lbs and it fits perfectly. definitely recommend to order down. 
as i'm wearing it to yoga i wear a sports bra underneath, that also helps with the very deep and open back to cover up a bit more. highly recommend, the top hits in all the right spots to make one",5
"I first saw this sweater coat in the retailer catalog that i got in the mail. i thought it was beautiful. so ethereal! i never thought that i would own it, though because of the initial price. i never thought it would make it to clearance. to my surprise, it did, and then went the extra 30% off! i took the plunge. i followed the advice of the other reviewers, and ordered a size down, a small. i am glad that i did. i still feel like i get the oversized, wrapped in warmth feel. it is not a figure fl",5
Like the crossover design of this sweater. the v-neck is not low cut and can be worn without cami. sweater is thin but not find it to be see through although i always were tank tops under my shirts. did not find it to be itchy.,5
"This is my new favorite summer dress, seriously. i purchased this dress while there were no reviews at the time but i'm so glad a took a chance. the colors are pretty close to the picture shown; maybe more of a lilac hue than mauve. i normally wear a 6 petite or a 4 regular in dresses, so i went with a 6p. as other reviewers have mentioned, this dress seems to run a little bigger so i could have easily gotten a 4 petite (for the shorter length) and it still would've been flowy. i have chosen to",5
Dress really pretty and great quality. slip is small if large breasted.,5
"I loved the fit and vibrant color of this dress. it's loose and flows but doesn't look like a potato sack. i wore it once and got a ton of compliments. that said, i hand washed it, as the tag states, then let it line dry, and it shrunk to half its size! i re-checked the tag and noticed that under the hand wash instructions it then states ""dry clean recommended."" boo. so disappointed that i spend over $100 for a dress i wore once.",1
"I found this at my retailer store--the only dress left. i bought this in black in my usual size small (4-6). this dress was so pretty on and fabulous in hot weather. the material is gauzy and so the look is casual. i'm not sure i would wear it in the evening but the fit was great. i am tall, (5' 9"") and the dress is long enough for me. i would say it is the same length as on the model. it is a bit pricey for what it is but i bought it as a birthday gift to myself.",5
"Ok. so this coat is amazing! it's high quality, soft, great pattern. the knit lining helps to make this more of a light weight coat than a sweater type coat. it's been warmer this season so i've worn it as a coat and received many compliments. it might not be warm enough for january in new england but i bought a size up so i could wear it over a sweater and still use it as a coat. this was purchased on sale w 25% off sale code, so for me, that was a steal. so happy it went on sale! give it a try",5
This sweater coat is a keeper. yes it runs large but if you wear it as a coat and not a sweater it works well. plus it is very warm. for size i normally wear a large 12/14 and i ordered a medium. great for layering soft winter whites. i wore this christmas shopping and everyone asked about it all day. this will for sure go into my retailer classic closet.,5
"Loved this sweater coat the first time i saw it online......then the price....yikes! the style, color and fabric design is beautiful. waited for it to sale and then hurray an extra 30%. off to my local store for a try on as i would not have wanted to even try it at the regular price. it is wonderful! it runs very large. i went down two sizes to achieve the fit i was looking for from a large to a small. in my opinion the product shot model is wearing a size too large. even sizing down it is not t",5
Runs a tad big but not enough to say it runs large if that makes sense - but just beautiful!,5
"My mother, who is not a dress person, ordered this dress for a summer wedding in the black hills. we'd spend 20+ hours searching for the perfect dress, and she'd returned three other options (different stores). after admiring this dress for awhile, she decided to try it, and is so happy she did! the color is just a slightly darker shade of purple than what is pictured in most of the images, but that's what she was hoping for. it fits wonderfully, and looks extremely elegant.",5
"Great jeans, great cut, great fit & i love the distressed look. the rise was higher than i thought but not a deal-breaker. i typically wear 26 in most brand of jeans & got these in 26.",5
"Clothes generally tend to look great when you're svelte. hence thin models. i've recently put on a few pounds (normally a 4-6, xs, small in retailer, 5'6"" and i have boobs) and when i get lazy and eat a little too much i get it around the middle. i already have a chest so that makes finding clothes to look flattering harder bc the boobs create the apple effect. all that said just to make the point that this is a flattering sweater. i grabbed it last minute on the way to the dressing room, but i ne",5
"I agree with the other reviewer-- this is classic retailer old-style quality. the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical. the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist. i usually choose s/m in cardigans (for ref, 5'8"", 135 lbs, 34-b), but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me. i think it just depends what you are looking for. unique it is, and certainly lovely.",5
"This coat is really beautiful, and pictures don't do it justice. it runs very large. i'm normally an xl or l in sweaters, but because of the balloony shape, i actually took a medium - even then it looks like i'm being enveloped, so i prefer to wear it unsnapped.",5
Yes! this dress is so lovely. i wear a size 6. a size 6 in this was perfect. under slip over a delicate overlay. heading to italy and this will be so perfect. drape is so flattering. colors are feminine. cut is lovely. effortlessly elegant and reads much more expensive. don't hesitate. a special one.,5
"So many retailer coats have gotten away from me. sold out before i could purchase. i bought this during the holidays when it went on sale. i did not want this the be the one that got away. so glad i did. the colors are beautiful, the sweater is really a coat. so it justifies the price. what a gorgeous piece to wear with all of my retailer clothes. length of arms was fine on me. i bought a large. i am 5 foot six.",5
"I'll admit, i had a lot of sticker shock when i saw this was a moth sweater coat at this price point. but i was immediately drawn to it. this is a one of a kind piece for sure. the colors are vibrant, the design is stylish and it is beautifully unstructured. it has a cocoon shape, wool on the outside and a soft knit on the inside. its a bit heavier (as you would expect a wool coat to be.) my absolute favorite part is the print. very classic on top, and very boho on bottom. it is gorgeous. i woul",5
"Alright ladies...this jacket!! its even better than it appears online. the green anorak fabric has a little stretch to it and is super comfortable. because of the stretch, i was able to do a large instead of my normal xl. but the real show stopper is the fringed sweater. it is gorgeous. it lays beautifully open or closed and is so soft and warm. the design has so much detail to it. there is also this amazing tie in back so you can cinch the waist if you want. this jacket will look amazing with a",5
This jacket is beautiful in colors and warm enough to wear in the fall or layer it with a sweater in the winter. it is more taylored at the bottom at the legs and would be great with leggings or jeans. i originally ordered a large but found myself swimming in it so happy it was still available in medium so i re-ordered it. definitely order it in a size smaller. sadly it was after the sale had ended but great customer service they issued it for me at the price i originally paid. (ps i'm 8 months,5
"This is such a lovely piece. i usually wear a medium in moth. i am 135 pounds and 5'4"". the quality is exceptional. i highly recommend this sweater coat.",5
"Light and delicate and certainly not a color i would usually pick for myself but at sale price this was a lucky steal for me! if i had known how much i would love this dress i would've paid full price. as for sizing, i am top heavy but picked the smaller end of my size range instead of my usual. the slip is just about tts and the silk outer is larger and flowy. for fit reference: 5'3"", 36dd, 140#, barrel chested, large upper arms and i purchased size 8.",5
"This dress is so beautiful. i am 50 5'8"" and smaller on top larger on bottom. size 6 is perfect! was worried that it would hit me in all the wrong places. happy to say it does not. wore it for the first time yesterday and no lie i received no less than 15 compliments from strangers. just walked up to tell me how great the dress was. colors are so soft and beautiful. would buy in other colors if they had it. i can see myself wearing it to a casual dinner, to a wedding our just to feel special on",5
Like my title suggests this is lovely and perfect for summer. the lining however is not silk it's rayon and sat weird on me. it offered no coverage on my top and actually is quite useless (i do have a large bust). i have a free people slip that will work and because of that will i'm keeping the dress. the outer shell is silk and really lovely and the colours are true to the picture.,5
Love this sweater! it is very simple but pretty! it has a very flattering fit and is comfortable.,5
"I was a little apprehensive about getting this dress without any reviews, but i am really glad i did. first, it looks exactly as pictured, maybe even more beautiful. the material is nice and flowing, and very light, so it's going to make a fantastic summer dress. there are two layers- an under layer which can be completely detached from the pink silk top layer.  the reason why i say true to size is that even though the pink silk layer is pretty loose, the bottom layer conforms more your body. i'",5

"Very cute shorts. sadly, after one wash they became a lint magnet so had to be returned. disappointing quality.",5
"I treated myself to get this at full-price at the start of summer. my size is xl and it fits me like the model photos. i have gotten such good use out of this blouse. it washes well without shrinking. it's vintage-looking. so comfortable. i love the arm coverage, interesting neckline that covers bra straps, good length. the cami it came with is flimsy so i threw it away. i use another tank underneath. i'd love any of the colors. the blus was more my color but all of them are gorgeous because of",5
"I expected this to be a pretty basic peasant top but was pleasantly surprised with all aspects of my purchase. fabric is soft and flowing with a perfect feminine vibe. it has a nice liner and the length and fit are perfect. can be dressed up or down as you like it. does run a bit large but it's due to the style, not the sizing. i ordered my usual size and cannot be happier with it. go ahead-press the button!",5
"This dress is beautiful. i love the collar and tie neck detail. i decided to order up a size and am very glad i did (i normally wear a 0 or 2 petite and ordered this in a 4 petite). it fits perfect with a little room...not snug at all, which i like. the description says its a slimmer fit so i'm happy i ordered the size i did. i'm excited to wear it and add it to my wardrobe.",5
"Beautiful, timeless dress. runs small, straight fit. can't wait to wear it to work or a function,",5
Well made gorgeous skirt that can be worn with heels and lace top or tee shirt and big jewelry. true to size. i am a 2/4 and the extra small was great. poofs out a bit but not like you're a fairy. i would say the blue (which i ordered) is more of a seafoam / mint green which is also lovely and spring time.,5
"Omg! where have you been all my life? this t-shirt is the best....not see-through, perfect length, perfect v-neck (no cami required), amazing colors, perfect shape, not tight (body skimming), doesn't poof out or look weird on larger busts and goes with everything from jeans to dress pants. i want every color, but for now i ordered the moss and blue which goes perfectly with my fair skin and long silver hair. oh and did i mention the sleeves are perfect to wear with or without a cardigan! no slee",5
These are the perfect combination of comfort and beauty. i highly recommend.,5
I love wide-leg pants and i'm so glad they're back. i bought this pair in the navy and cream colors as soon as i saw them online. i bought my usual size 28 in retailer and they fit just fine. the navy color is more like a dark blue but still perfect for spring/summer. comfortable material and overall good quality. i just wish they came in more colors.,5
"Great basic tee with just the right amount of extra detail. the length is perfect--not too long, not too short. fit is relaxed and comfortable without looking sloppy. i'm coming back for more colors!",5
"This is the best dress. i received it last week and have already worn it three times. perfect fit. casual and so easy but the length and front details make it so fun. thicker than many other ""tshirt"" dresses... but light enough that i wasn't overly hot on super warm days. def recommend!!!!",5
"I tried this on in the store and was pleasantly surprised at how cute it was! i'm 5'4"" and the large fits me loosely but is still shapely. because it's a little longer on me, it's great to wear both to work and on the weekends. just wish it came in more colors! you can't see the color in the photo, but there's a sea green lining which is a cute touch!",5
"This is one of the best purchases i've ever made... i have had the black for over a year, and every time i wear it, i receive so many complements. i've dressed it up with a striped scooped back shirt, or a fitted sweater, and paired it with flannel with a belt... i love it. i'm 6' ft and slender, and the xs it hits me at the perfect length just below the knee. i recently ordered the silver in a small (it's a little big in the waist- but nothing a corset belt can't help) for nye. love this dress!",5
"The picture onlin does not do these pant jsutice, it makes them look wide and short. well, that might be why these are percect for me, but on my body type (muscular bottom), they are awesome. the material is stretchy, soft, and thick enough to keep shape and not show dimples. lvoe the blue and green color, so rich. i am keeping the green as they are more unique. at 115 lbs, i ordered 25p. the yfit perfectly, but my styllsit keeps insiting that they wil lstretch and made me order the 24p. we shal",5
"These pants are super funky. the colors have a 70's vibe. retailer do the pants a disservice styling them like the image on the website. they are playfully chic. besides the look, they are super comfy and have a nice stretch. perfect for my job as an art teacher. give them a shot!",5
"This shirt is everything i wanted it to be! lightweight, easy style without being shapeless. it is sheer, but perfect with a tank underneath. i'm an extra small, and it fit perfectly - not tight, not too loose...honestly, if it came in more colors i'd buy it in every one. definitely going to be a fall staple!",5
"I am so glad that wide leg pants are coming back! i love this style - so flattering! the color on these (blue) is rich and unique and the fit is exactly what i was hoping for. i wanted them loose and low waisted and they are perfect. i am 5'4"" 122 lbs and ordered 27 petite. the length (listed at 30"") is spot-on with flats, no tailoring needed. i previously ordered these in white in 27 r. they also are good but a little too loose and will need hemming. def. recommend and hope retailer keeps this st",5
"Love this dress. i'm wearing it as a bridesmaid in a fall, casual outdoor wedding. i think it's fancy enough and can also be dressed down later. 

i'm 6' tall and skinny, with large breasts and this dress fits. beautiful! not too much cleavage. :)

it's not real lace but no one could tell. great quality and nice weight to dress. great for dancing and spinning!",5
Great casual weekend pants and super comfy and great color.,5
"I knew i would love these pants because of the cute sailor styling, but the unusual green color. i am 5'5"" and thought i would be stepping on them, but i am fine. they are longer than the picture with the model on the website which i expected, but they are fine. the fabric is beautiful and i can't wait to wear them with my white-on-white sneakers. i will also mix it up with sandals. i wrote below that my style is bohemian, but truthfully i dress in all the ways listed below...classic, romantic,",5
"These pants are so comfortable. they're very flowy, and provide so much airflow to keep you cool during hot days. i actually bought these pants for work (i'm a teacher). i like to pair them with a white top and a cardigan. the waist band is elastic, which is super nice. the only thing i would like better is if the waist line was higher. the pants come up right below my natural waist, so they're not quite as high waisted as i would like. but other than that, their silky material give them the ill",5
"These pants are great! they are comfortable, light and flowy. they are perfect for summer!",5
"This tee is very comfortable and the colors are amazing! i initially purchased in the marigold yellow as i was instantly drawn to the color in store. it's a beautiful shade that will transition nicely into fall. i've since purchased the green which i liked on even more so than on the rack. overall, a nice quality everyday tee. the pocket and embroidered neck make it something retailer!!",5
I love these pants. they are a beautiful color and very well made. i like the fit and the style very much.,5
"I love this skirt... i have it in black, and when i saw this color i was so excited to add another one to my wardrobe. these skirts are made  well... it's not flimsy at a all. the actually color is more of a light aqua blue, so if you are wanting a baby blue might not be for you...",5
Sweet leg warmers that are fun and cute too! kept me warm when out in this frosty morning!,5
Great pants! great fall colors. great for day or night. super fun and funky. love them!,5
"I tried these on in the store and instantly fell in love with them - they have an elastic waist which for my shape (pear) can sometimes be bad, but these pants don't cut me off or accentuate the ""fluffy"" parts, but lay nice over my belly and legs in a flattering way. they do have a slit that goes the whole way up the leg, that the picture doesn't show, but the underneath piece of fabric wraps around your legs, so i think it would be hard to show too much. i bought a medium and they hit lower on",5
"I am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses, and i ended up with a 4 in this one. i could barley zip up the 0, and while i could have gotten away with the 2, there is no elasticity in the waistband. the 4 is very slightly roomy, but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me. for reference, i'm 109-111 lbs, 5'4, and a 30b. 

when i was finally able to wear the dress, i got compliments galore. it really is a beautiful dress! just be sure to size up!",5
This dress is very versatile and flattering on-- i've already worn it out to casual cocktails with friends twice since i've gotten it. i'm 5'3 and 125 lbs and the 4 petite worked perfectly on me.,5
Super comfortable summer dress. just bought it yesterday and i don't want to take it off. soft lightweight fabric.,5
"I just love all pilcro pants. they are great for any occasion, any type of weather. i am 5'5"" 125 lb. and i wear a 27 in all pilcro pants and they fit perfectly. only bummer is that i have to iron them, but they iron easily. length of these pants is just a tad long, but i can wear wedges with them and that solves the problem.",5
"This top is super cute and colorful. admittedly, i have not used it just as a pajama top because i think the world deserves to see this piece of art. super comfy and i recommend this for everyone in most shapes and sizes!",5
I love these pjs! the sale price finally made the set affordable and i could not be happier! so soft and comfy!,5
Purchased the daisy sleep top to go with the matching shorts. i had been eyeing them for awhile in the store and so glad i took the plunge to get the set. i feel feminine and sexy as another reviewer noted while not being revealing (helpful for visitors and children :). i purchased a s as it does run a bit large.,5
Nice non clingy cut. has details so more than a basic t-shirt.,5
"I purchase this top of ""what i thought to be a beautiful denim tunic/top"" in a small on the sale rack with additional promo with beautiful details , but what is going on with the mid-section where there is at least 6 inches of space where there is no button or way to close the lower placket! and the lower bottom of placket is sewn shut so it makes the mid section bubble out, but why no buttons to close what would be a button down top???? you can slide your hand through this open space and it ope",1
Made my wedding outfit perfect!,5
"Love, love, love these pants! i have yet to remove the tags and wear them, but that shall happen over this weekend. the fit is comfortable, and while the pants are not oversized, they are very generous in the m
that i purchased. the colour that seems to confuse more than is few is really a great combination of a black or navy stripe (depends on your lighting and opinion here...!) with tobacco/khaki on a white ground. the pleats at the top
just add to the great design, and i like that they sit",5
Dress just did not fit will around the hips.  also the string belt was defective - basically about to come off.  looks like someone may have wore it and returned it.  was not flattering at all.,1
"I'm 7 months pregnant and bought this dress yesterday, it is perfect! the wrap design makes it possible to expand the skirt and still look cute. i'm 5'3"" bought the small and look forward to wearing this after i deliver as well.",5
"I am wearing a bodysuit and long skirt from bhldn for my wedding, and i bought this skirt to change in to for my reception. it is perfectly elegant, yet simple. i cannot wait to wear it on my big day! it can be dressed up or down so easily! love it!",5
The floral print and colors are so pretty for summer that it's tempting to layer this over a seamless tank and wear it out!,5
"I bought this in xl and it fits just as shown. i could size down to a l and it would still fit because there is a lot of flow to this top. so, if you want a more tailored, but loose fit, then size down.

 but, it isn't boxy. and, the deep v is sexy, but not immodest. and the pocket looks like silk, but it's just polyester. the pleating in the back gives this movement or move-ability, like when you drive. there isn't much pull. 

it's a thin light material and very cool for hot, humid summer",5
"This is such a beautiful top, so flattering, soft and comfortable.  it is great as a layering piece.  the colors are vibrant.  the blue is a gorgeous blue, a deep cobalt blue.  i got one in every color.",5
Beautiful dress that is very flattering! wearing it to my bridal shower.  more appropriate for spring or summer!,5
"This is a very appealing and flattering tee! the details really make this quite lovely: the back pleat makes the fit fabulous and motion ideal, the stitching at the neckline is attractive and artistically pleasing, the proportions are balanced, nothing too full or tight. although the tee is 100% cotton, the pocket is 100% polyester, quite silky and a nice accent. i bought the ""white"", which is more of an ivory and gorgeous, with complementary deeper ivory stitching. my usual medium fits great (s",5
"Love these chinos, super soft and amazingly comfy.....and quite flattering for wide-leg pants!",5
"I purchased this in london, early april, and i wore it to a summer wedding. it was perfect and hangs very nicely. the colors are rich and the deep blue flowers have texture. the front slit goes up to about the knee but doesn't split apart when walking which i appreciated. the only thing that i felt was a little off was the circumference of the sleeves. i have to keep them unbuttoned but thankfully it looks like just an interesting detail and not so much like an unbuttoned sleeve. a definite keep",5
"This top fits tts. the sweater part is cream, eyelet material is white. love it!",5
I love this top. i wish i had more like this to cycle into my wardrobe,5
"I have been on the hunt for a black pencil skirt. so i decided to give this one a try based on the previous review. i love it! i didn't size up, went with 0p (26.5 in waist, 115lbs, 36 ish inches hips). the waist is fitted. the stylist said when she tried it on, it pooched, but i didn't feel that way on me. i had a simple t-shirt on and it looked so cute. the petite length was also perfectly on point. the lace part hit me above the knee, and the lining a little over that - perfect and flattering",5
I loved the layered look without all the bulk. the different textures make it so interesting.,5
"Just gorgeous, the dress makes a nice transition piece for early fall! perfect in every way!",5
"I loved this dress after seeing it online.it is a pullover dress, and is easy to get on. my major problem with the dress is that the waist is extremely high (about 3 inches over my natural waist), and i usually have no problem with the placement of the waist in dresses. i'm going to keep the dress because i like everything else about it: the fit is flattering and the dress will be seasonless here in california. i""ll search for a wide belt to cover the waistline, or perhaps skip a belt altogether",5
"Can't say how much i love this top - ordered on a whim and when it arrived i was so pleasantly surprised. the sweatshirt fabric is thick, the under layers are high quality sheers. super easy to dress up or down - i wore it to a (casual) company holiday party and got tons of compliments. bonus that i just had a baby and the top seemed to hide my not-quite-prepregnancy body, but will also look great when i am back in shape. a definite keeper!",5
"I really love the colors of this dress - very unique and classy combo. little bit of a retro look to it. even though there is no zipper it's somehow fitted and flattering. i plan to wear it to a wedding this summer in the mountains where it gets chilly in the evening so i'm thrilled to find a summer dress with sleeves. it will work well for plenty of other occasions too. only problem is the buttons on the sleeves are nearly impossible to button. just too tight. for reference i'm 5'9"", 140 lbs an",5
"It's still a bit cool here in minnesota. however, it won't be long before i can wear this lightweight, drapey but figure-flattering blouse. i am 5ft 3in and the 0 petite, fits well.",5
"These are super cute and i love the ties on the legs. fit is true to size. i bought them on sale and they had some black marks on the front when received. i called retailer and their great customer service guaranteed that i could return them if the black did not come out when washed. it did, so i'm stoked.",5
"Super comfortable top. easily washable, 2 options with the sleeves, and a nice drape to the fabric. truly a go-anywhere top.",5
I love these jeans. the fit is much better than the white pilcro hyphen slit jean which is cuts lower. nice weight. not to heavy and not too light in weight. these look terrific with the vanja peasant top in the yellow print. a darling outfit. the lace give them flair and dress them up so i can wear them to work. highly recommend!!,5
Such a cute jean! got these specifically for the tie up lace ankle (and price)! also love the shade of gray i bought.,5
You know how you look in your closet and things just say i'm perfect for today. this top is like that. i got it a few weeks ago and have worn it often because it is so easy and hangs really nice. i bought the black one and am considering the off white one.,5
Im normally an xs and i bought size 2 and it fit great. very slimming and looks great with white capris.,5
Love the shirt and style. shirt looks better in person than online picture. i would get a size down because it runs a little big.,5
I love this top and the relaxed fit. can be dressed up or down. i bought the bird print and liked it so much i purchased the umbrella print. now i'm contemplating getting the mixed dot! easy to just throw on with anything and the mix of colors keeps it versatile too!,5
"I love bows,
this dress is very cute and flattering, while being comfortable. it may be sleeveless, but i think with the right boots and cardigan, it can be brought into fall easily. color is a nice green. i tried on both the 00p and 0p, and though i loved the fit of the 00p better (width), i preferred the length of the 0p - otherwise, not much difference there... i think it is well worth keeping it, even though i don't need yet another dress... material is pretty comfortable too. back is lower",5
Really adorable and very retro looking.. fits true to size but i got it a size larger because i wanted to tie up the bottom.. have had it 3 days & have worn it twice already!!!,5
"I love this unique t-shirt. the fall colors and ranchers theme are perfect with skinny jeans and boots. a western look that's feminine. the shirt is very soft, ordered my usual size small, a little long but good for tucking in.",5
"This top is so nice i bought it in 2 colors. washes well but does need to be ironed. 
fits true to size.",5
"I ordered a size 10 in the neutral motif and it fits perfectly and it looks great. i am 5'9"" 145lbs with 38"" bust. the sleeves are the perfect length. i couldn't be happier with this purchase.",5
The tshirt is comfy and has a little curve on the tail which is fun!,5
"I'm in love with this top! i usually wear a s/m or 6, and the size 6 fits perfectly. the cut is very flattering and i love that the sleeves can be worn rolled up and buttoned or down (and when they're down they hit right at the wrist, not too long or short). it's lightweight and comfy, but looks really pulled together. i can see myself wearing this both with ripped boyfriend jeans and sneakers and with dress pants and a blazer. a great transitional piece.

i only wish this came in solid white (o",5
"I bought these for next year. ordered both 27 & 28 and kept the 27, which i would say is a pretty true 6.",5
This shirt is very comfortable and i received a lot of compliments when i wore it. i bought the neutral print and everyone wants to get close to see what it is . i would buy another if it came in this type of pattern.,5
This is a comfortable pretty blouse. i purchased the neutral print and am very pleased with it.,5
I bought this top in the stripe and i'm ordering the black now. it's a nice top to transition from summer to fall (even though the temp. doesn't change much in texas...#. it does run a bit large so size down. held up nicely when washed #hand wash cycle).,5
I got two of the shirt am totally in love with them. i didn't get the one in black only because i have too many things in black. the shirts look awesome with leggings or skinny jeans. i'm very happy with this purchase!!!,5
"I tried these on in in a 27/4 in the store and they were a bit snug. they graciously offered to look online and found the 28/6. they arrived in less than a week and are perfect. a note was enclosed saying they actually ran out of this size but another store was able to find them and ship...i love that retailer did not even call and worry me over it, they just fixed the problem. thank you!",5
"This top is very flattering, the fabric flows and moves. it fits perfectly (slim cut), but hides tummy bulges and other imperfections. and it's slimming too. can be dressed up or down, goes with everything. i ended up buying all three colors, and if there were more, i would buy more!",5
"I bought this in the black and white and like it a lot. i typically wear an xs or s, and purchased the small. glad i did because i think the xs would have been too snug. i like the tunic length and the fabric feels soft and smooth. it's a little low cut for me, but i'll wear a cami under it.",5
I love this! i pair it with jeans or leggings and it works wonderfully. it's comfortable and stylish and a necessary addition to my wardrobe. it's a staple piece that i know i'll be able to use for years.,5
"Love everything about these pants. a little sheer, but super beautiful and comfortable.",5
I wasn't sure how the fabric would be since i ordered it online but i wasn't disappointed. its got a lot of movement which makes it really comfortable while still being cute. it's a little longer than i anticipated but i don't mind that. it just gives it a little more versatility. also it has pockets!! i love pockets so maybe i'm a little biased.,5
"I saw a sales associate (sa) wearing it at my local retailer and totally loved it. this t-shirt runs very large, so it depends on how one wants to wear it. the sa wore it oversized and tied to the side, super cute. i tried on a regular small and it was still 2 sizes too big and too long on me. i ordered the xs petite and it fits perfectly, not too fitted and not too loose (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). my mother was a great embroider and the ""giddy up"" embroidery work at the neckline and the",5
"These are a different take on the white jean. thick enough that you don't see undies. cool lace detail on the ankles. i have very long legs, so they hit me a little higher than described. i did undo the laces a bit to give them a little kick at the bottom. i love the fit of the plico jean. i own a few pairs and they sit just high enough on my waist so when you bend over your bottom doesn't peek out. i usually wear a 27, and they aren't too tight and have a bit of stretch, but don't loose their s",5
"Love this top! you can definitely wear this out with jeans or with dress pants for work. it can be dressed up or down, so it's very versatile. the red motif is a gorgeous color for spring and summer. received lots of compliments!",5
I bought this in size xl in the moss color. it fits true to size. it's very comfortable--the fabric is soft. i love the draping of this top. i'm a pear-shape and this type of cut is my favorite. the moss color looks black online but is really a dark forest green. i'd love to see this top made in other colors.,5
"Received today, the fit is true to size quality fabric beautiful color. will go with so many things!",5
"Could not say enough great things about this jacket. nice quality and drape and such a wearable, comfortable option as opposed to a more structured blazer. nice, true to size fit (petite small was perfect on my 5'2"" 115 lbs frame--not too tight and not baggy, sleeves still 3/4.) will order an petite xs for my daughter, too. retailer, i would definitely buy other colors if you decide to order them.",5
"I hesitated to order this for a long time but am glad i did. i was concerned that it would have trouble staying on the shoulders, and would be unflattering to my large chest (34f). however, it is surprisingly comfortable and secure (has some kind of rubbery grips on the shoulders that keep it in place). very well-designed, and actually supportive to the chest. it offers the sun-protection i am looking for (i am also very pale and tired of getting odd burns on my stomach and chest), and as i head",5
"These jeans are my new favorites! very flattering cut and color, and very high quality. i've worn them a ton since i got them, and they haven't stretched out or lost their shape at all. only thing i would caution is that they run small... for reference, i wear a 26 in paige denim, a 27 in citizens, and 28 was perfect in these.",5
"I was really intrigued by this swimsuit when i saw it online but i wasn't sure how it would look on me but the reviews convinced me i should get it and figured if i didn't like it i could just return it. i love this suit, the color is beautiful and the high neckline is off-set by the open back. for anyone who has a large chest, which i do (32g), this is one of the most secure/supportive swimsuit i have ever tried on. do not hesitate to buy this suit, though i would go a size up if you have a lar",5
"This was my favorite piece in my order. it fit so well that i immediately went online to see if they had other colors. they don't. i voice the other reviewers opinion: get more colors in of this style. i would order in a heartbeat. i plan on wearing this to work (it's freezing in my office) but it is versatile enough to pair with jeans for a casual look. the material was soft, woven tightly (a good thing) and well made. good one retailer! definitely a keeper.",5
This was surprisingly more complimentary and easier to wear than i though it would be. i love vix bathing suits and the quality is exceptional!,5
"These jeans fit so well and are made of really high quality denim. soft and comfortable but not too much stretch...just enough. i'm short so i have to cuff them. i kinda wish they came in petite or ankle length, but they look cute cuffed too.",5
"This is a very well made swimsuit with soft foam cups and fully lined. the shoulders stay put with thin strips of foam that are sewn in. very comfortable and easy to move in; my arms have full range. the color is like the online photo, and to the teal close-up i posted of the shoulder area.
.
the size 'm' that i ordered fit my bust very well with smooth lines and decent support. i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37, 30d / 32c bra, with a average to long torso with a full bottom and thighs. i think the",5
"I was so pleased to receive this dress after purchasing it online -- the color is vibrant, the lace is beautiful, and it is fully lined! fit is true to size, and its a fit and flare dress so flattering for most body types. i could dress it up or down for lunches or weddings so overall, i think its a great dress for a great price!",5
"I love this suit, and have gotten so many compliments on it. i weigh 106-108 lbs. and ordered a s. typically i order xs but am glad i went with the size up. the coloring is beautiful. the legs are high cut / flattering. the top has no padding, and shows a seamless result. highly recommend!",5
"This dress is even prettier in person. i'm 5'5"" and usually a 4 in fit and flare dresses and got this in a 4. fits like a glove and hits right above my knee. the hook and eye closure does get caught on the delicate lace, so be careful of that. otherwise, this dress is perfect for summer weddings!",5
"Love this dress! very feminine and flattering. i would say that it runs true to size, or a little big. size down for a snug fit at the waist.",5
I am so happy i decided to purchase these. they are the only invisible socks i've found that actually stay on my feet. all others always slip off my heel... these are great!,5
"These are really stunning. they look exactly like the picture with the pattern matching up perfectly at the seams. i love the mirror image pattern. they're just a bit snug where at first i thought i might not be able to get them on, but once on, they actually fit perfectly. so, i think that's actually how yoga pants are supposed to fit. i'm 115, 5'6"" and i got the xs.",5
"This suit is better than i expected. i'm a large d cup and with this type of top style, i typically size up. i'm a 4 bottom but would normally would order a large top because this type of top runs small...not here. i ordered the large and, much to my suprise, it's too big. i'm sending back. i may order a small and medium just to be safe, but the cups are definitely not cut too small here. the bodice is very flattering with the black and white contrast. so pretty!",5
"I purchased this for a recent trip with my friends and thought it was worth the price. the swimsuit is comfortable, yet flattering and all the patterns are really unique. i received a lot of compliments about the swimsuit! the one downside was that the fabric hook for one of the straps broke so i had to sew it back on. other than that, this was a great purchase! i recommend this to anyone who wants a very whimsical, but comfy swimsuit!",5
"The colors on these leggings are just beautiful!  the material is very soft and has a nice thickness to it.  no issues with see thru material.  i am 5'8"", 145, and i ordered my usual medium.",5
My local store offered this dress in a navy colorway with sky blue and pink embroidery. tried it on and fell in love! it fits well while being comfortable. my favorite part is the skirt - perfect flirty a-line. already bought matching cardigans and can't wait to wear this to work. so perfect for spring!,5
"I love this skirt! so soft and comfortable, i wore it casual with black nike sneakers, a black loose turtleneck top and a moto leather jacket. i tried on the m and l and went with the m, so i would say it is true to size because that is what i usually wear. i'm 5'9', 145 lbs,
nice thick fabric, but not heavy, good for cool weather.",5
"I just purchased this dress yesterday in the navy for my anniversary next month. i have to say its totally stunning on. the embroidery is beautiful, extremely figure flattering and the dress is very well constructed. i have to disagree with other reviews who say it doesn't or won't work for bustier women. i am a 34 d, 5'8"" tall and normally wear a size 4. the 4 fits perfectly and the deep v-like neckline creates a very nice bit of cleavage. maybe too much for some at the office i would say, but",5
"Loved this dress. i am 5'5"", 34c, normally wear a 2 in most. the 0 fit (a 2 wasn't available in-store), but i will say showed more cleavage on me than in the shown picture.

gorgeous dress- wish it were just a little less costly, but would be a great purchase for easter, weddings, etc.",5
The dress looks better than the pictures online. it also arrives quite quickly after i placed my order. i am about 126 lbs and 4p fits me perfectly. the embroidery is so radiant in multiple colors against the navy blue dress. i am very please with this purchase.,5
"Very pretty dress, the blue is a little lighter than navy but is still really nice. the embroidered flowers are lovely as well. the a-line cut is very flattering on. i can't wait to wear this dress this spring!",5
This skirt is so cozy and comfortable. it is form fitting but has a lot of give/stretch. the material feels high quality and heavy without being overly hot. i am sure this will be a go to skirt.,5
Great quality and works in many ways! highly recommend.,5
"I wore this to a gala and i plan on wearing it over and over again. the dress is very comfortable and looks polished. i wore this dress for 12 hours and did not want to take it off. the embroidery is beautiful and appears to be well done. i am 5'5 and the dress hit me 2 inches above my knee. i highly recommend this dress, i received so many compliments.",5
The stitching on this dress is absolutely beautiful and very detailed.,5
Love this dress so beautiful embroidery is lovely....well worth the price!!!,5
"One of my new absolute favs! so elegant and flattering. the dress is as appears online and it is true to size. i purchased my usual size 4 with 27"" waist, chest 34 b/c. note, that there is not a lot of give to the fabric, so busty women may need to size up. purchased with the minuet necklace!",5
"I'm 5'3"" and 160 pounds with short legs and got a large petite. it fits really well (a tiny bit too short but could just be my proportions) and the quality seems very high. definitely can be dressed up or down (good for a business casual work environment).",5
"This is the first time that i have tried mother jeans, and i am a fan. these jeans fit tts, and the high waist is flattering and stays put. i personally am a big fan of the distressing - it's just enough, but not too much - and it's lined on the inside so it won't get worse. i know some people won't like that, but i did. also, they hit right below my ankle (i'm 5'5"") instead of being a few inches too long -- a major bonus. thus, they look great rolled or not. but perhaps most importantly, these",5
"I'm 5'2"" 110, 32-24.5-32.5. i tried both the regular 0 and petite 0. the difference was quite substantial. sometimes if an item runs shorter or smaller, i can get away with regular sizing. the regular 0 was all wrong, and the petite 0 was perfect in every way the regular 0 was wrong! the petite sizing was perfect for top coverage, tamed the flare to just the right amount, and the length hit right at the perfect spot where it is supposed to above the knee. gorgeous embroidered detailing and versa",5
"This dress is well made, great fit, perfect a-line. the bust was lower cut than shown in the picture, but it fits well even with a large chest. completely flattering and i would highly recommend!",5
"These pants are my favorite! not only is the fit slimming and perfect, but i get compliments on the design every single time i wear them. i absolutely love these, well worth the money.",5
"This is a great dress, i feel like it hides any imperfect spots including some armpit fat or belly fat. i have gotten several compliments on this dress because the stitching for the flowers is very high quality!",5
"This is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress. really love it. however, there's no way that model is 5' 10"" in the photo because i'm 4 inches shorter than that, and the dress is 2 inches shorter on me. it's really not a dress, it's a tunic. i'm happy with it because it's so pretty, but i did think i was buying a dress. i just wore it with leggings and i'm happy with a beautiful tunic!",5
"This dress is a home run on all accounts. the embroidery is gorgeous, the fabric is high-quality, and the a-line cut is slimming. i found this dress to run true to size. i am 5'11"" and the length hits above the  knee--so it could be longer on shorter heights. i purchased the white dress initially and now have also ordered the navy.",5
"I got this version in the black and white and can't wait to wear it. it is very flattering on and will look great for those spring/summer events. the only thing that could have made this dress better would be side pockets like the fall/winter navy dress by the same designer had, but don't let that minor detail hold you back.",5
"Finally a dress that ticks all the right boxes: mostly natural fibers, lovely details, fantastic pattern placement, and an easy fit that doesn't require alterations. 
.
the dark blue cotton is similar to my embroidered floreat 'sunless skies shift' from around 2008 which looks like new after so many years (but required alterations even in petite). 
.
i'm 5'2"", currently 33-25-37 (30d/32c bra). the size 0 regular fit me and ended just below my knees. a bit low cut, and a tiny bit below my nat",5
The fit and design quality was grea! i love the fact that xxs petite is available online.,5
I love this skirt so much. it's so comfortable and flattering. the button design along the sides is adorable. it's got a liner inside the skirt that ensures that it's not see-through in anyway. it's a great buy.,5
This product fit well and was soft and beautifully made.,5
"I am petite and ordered size small, and it came looking like gym sweat pants. the material was very nice, but in terms of the waist and length size, both run incredibly large. the cuff of the joggers are also not elastic at all, and hangs loose widely. will have to return this item, unfortunately.",1
I love this dress. i didn't think that i would feel at ease as it is very form-fitting. but it is so comfortable! and warm. it is dressy yet casual. i have received many compliments.,5
"I have ordered many black and white dresses and end up getting cream and black. not this one! this is truly b&w! i love the stripes, the length (at the knee, 5'5"") and the pockets! time will tell in terms of fabric as rayon is not the most durable. the collar seems to stay down which makes it look 70's but fabric tape easily fixed it. overall, i love it!",5
"I tried this dress on in an xs petite. the dress runs slightly bigger, it sort of looked like a tent on me, whereas other xs p dresses at retailer fit tts. the other thing is that the dress just doesn't look like an almost $200 dress. the band that runs across the bust goes under the arms too. it isn't sewn in though, and it was folding down under the arms, making it look like its ripping off. the collar too seemed to pull down right in the center, as if the material was too heavy to stand it's we",1
"I am short waisted, and generally a petite on the top, so a lot of these sweater vest toppers i find to be too long in the torso for me. this one, however, is the perfect exception. it is soft, but with some structure, comfortable, and not too hot for warmer weather climates during the spring. i bought it in seattle, though i live in dallas, and found it to be a perfect layering piece with a 3/4 white t-shirt and a jean jacket, while walking around the rainy city. 
fyi: 5'2"", short waist, broad",5
"I ordered this tee despite the price. the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor. nice concept for a tee, but failed in quality and value. it was returned.",1
I had been waiting for this dress to go on sale and when it did it was only available in a petite xs. the only reason i said it ran big is because it was a petite and i usually wear a regular. i am 5'4 size 2. the length is perfect and i have really narrow shoulders so the petite fit perfect. the details on this dress are just beautiful and extremely comfortable.,5
"I love these shorts!!!! i usually have a really hard time finding shorts that fit my pear-shape, but these are great. i bought in a few different colors and i definitely will get a lot of use out of them this summer!",5
"Dress is wonderfully made. the fabric is soft and the print is beautiful.wonderful detail,especially the ties.  nice lining...not see thru at all.
mid calf length looks good with heels or flats.
lovely dress for a sunny day or an evening out!!",5
"I'm always looking for easy casual items that will withstand being washed a million times, and i think this one will fall into that category. it's a nice thick knit - durable yet soft and sooo cozy. length is fantastic for leggings. i'll basically live in this on weekends!",5
I would buy these pajamas in every color if offered. they feel wonderful to the touch and even better on!,5
"I decided to go shopping at my local co store and as soon as i walked in, i saw this skirt but it was used  as a top with green cropped summery pants on a mannequin. one of the lovely salesgirls decided she liked it better that way after she tried it as a top herself.  i tried it as well and love it as a top! she was small framed and my height and told me she sized up for comfort and she was correct. if used with a strapless bra, your regular size ( mine is a small) will be uncomfortable. howeve",5
"Joggers are my new style this spring/summer i think. i love the simplicity of this style. the cut is perfect, very true to size. i like the longer length - perfect to wear with kitten heels, flats, or slip on canvas. this color especially is really versatile and make them my go to pants once a week for a perfectly put together outfit.",5
"This jumper is so cute, it is soft, and you can dress it up or down depending on where your going.",5
"I loved this top on the mannequin, so i had to try it on... i am a 36c and normally wear an 8-10, i tried on the medium and it fit great. i have to agree with the other review that the pockets make you appear curvier.. but you can always take to a tailor to have them removed..i just folded the bottom part over for a slouchier look.. i've already received tons of compliments and plan on ordering the blue as well..",5
I saw this sweater at the store and instantly love it. it run large. i am 5'8 and 120 pounds and usually a size s in most retailer tops. i had to go with xxs on this one so def size down.,5
"Great, easy to wear addition to the wardrobe. i wore it all day today and no pilling! plus the pockets are really convenient...they are a good depth for car keys or a small wallet. i'm pretty busty (32ddd) and have a curvy body...with that said, the small fit well. i prefer wearing it with the zippers opened because my behind and hips look odd with the sweater fully zipped...(for ref 36 inch hips). give this one a shot...it's a nice surprise.",5
Love this top! it's great for wearing with leggings. the material is soft and not too heavy. love the variation the zippers give you! i have in the moss and love it!,5
"This is so ridiculously soft and conformable. it can be worn over workout clothes, or with skinnies or leggings. it looks fabulous either way. i wear mine the way the customer photo #2 is shown: meaning, folded over. but it looks great either way. the green is such a nice neutral: it looks great with black or shades of brown, tan, or even grey. the functional pockets are such a nice touch.
----------
my only ""criticism"" is this is a dolman-style/drop hem sleeve, which i am not a huge fan of - bu",5
"I am very petite, however, fuller on top (34ddd). this top looks fabulous! it is cut in such a way that every part of your body looks slimmer. goes with jeans, dress pants of skirt. i highly recommend.",5
"This top is very cute. it is a high low top that i wasn't expecting, but love it. the picture doesn't do it justice it fits closer to the body than on model. fits true to size usually a small and this one fits well in small. got at a ridiculous price which is an added bonus. will get a lot of wear out of this top.",5
"I was so excited to try these, it's hard to find cute bermuda shorts. the legs were so wide. my husband asked if i was wearing his shorts. they don't look that wide in the picture. i am 5'4"" and 130 lbs i bought my regular size 28 but the waist was huge i could have sized down one or two sizes. unrolled they came to my knee.",1
"Lovely, airy fabric and colors true to the pictures online. i am 5'3"" and 118lb. i ordered a regular s, and it fits fine. yes, it is midi length, coming to about 3"" below my knee. i would have preferred the 39"" length if it had been available, but it was not. still, i will compensate by wearing higher heels :-) the embroidered embellishment along the neck and sides stands out more than in the pic, and really makes this dress special. the cutaway shoulders give it sophistication. if you want to a",5
"This is a beautiful skirt. i'm very pleased with the quality. it runs small though, i'm usually size small and went for the medium. i'm 5' 2 and got the regular vs petit, which would have been too short for me to wear at work.",5
"I would say the skirt runs two sizes too small. i usually wear a size medium and based on other reviews, i purchased a large. i could barely get the skirt over my hips. even if it fit in the waist, it was much too short on me and i'm 5'2"". it's a cute skirt but it is fit for a tween.",1
"This tunic is so stylish and pretty. the fit is close but not clingy (5'4, 116 lbs., size xs) and the rear coverage is just right to wear with skinny jeans or leggings. the fit is flattering whether the zippers are up or down, without riding up around the waist. the cowled collar falls around the neck evenly without the bulky look that similar styles can sometimes lend. the moss color is pretty, the fabric is soft and warm yet still fairly lightweight. if the pockets are properly tucked and layi",5
This is by far my favorite romper. it is very flattering and the material feels wonderful against the skin.,5
"Yikes. there is a whole lot of skirt here. i am 5""4, weigh around 120 lb, and usually wear anywhere between a four and six in retailer clothing, depending on the designer. this skirt balloons out from the waist. on the website it seems to flow more naturally from the waist. i think that the flowers are cute but the material is cheap looking. the skirt is very long- hitting way below mid-calf. there is also tons of material - creating a parachute effect. definitely returning.",1
This is so pretty and 60s like. i tried on a return size 2 and it really fit. i am usually a zero so i was surprised. the regular size fit me really well. length was perfect. pretty heavy and substantial though. love the 3 d effect. 115 lbs. 30 dd. 26.5 in waist,5
This shirt is very swingy but true to size. when i tried to size down the shoulders were too tight. the green color has great texture.,5
"Love this dress. i think i scored the deal of the year with this one. found it in my local retailer store. it had been in my ""save for later"" forever but i couldn't bring myself to pay full price... then it sold out in my size online. i was in my local store browsing the new items on sale with the additional 40% off, and there it was 1, and only 1. and my size.... i picked it up, noticed the cut outs that are not very apparent in the online photos, but it back, picked it back up, put it back.....",5
Beautiful dress. i just wore this dress for my wedding. it was a beautiful wedding dress and i got many compliments on the uniqueness and the beading detail. there was one really big problem. the beads and the flowers kept falling off. i sat down and stood up leaving a pile of little flowers and beads. i could be standing still and they would periodically drop off. it was kind of embarrassing and everyone remarked that i was my own flower girl. i am still finding pieces of the dress everywhere.,5
"When i received this top, i thought it was even prettier than the online picture. the colors and beading are more vibrant in person. it is a full cut and does have an elastic band at the bottom but i liked the way it looked on. i ordered my usual size m and it fit me the same as it did the model in the picture. it is pretty shear. if you wear it to work or during the daytime, it will need a cami. however, in evening lighting, i don't find it to be that see through and i feel comfortable wearing",5
"I'm 119 and small frame, but took a chance and ordered the m. so glad...the fit was perfect. the robe is soft and beautiful!",5
"This is beautiful and fits perfect. it's even prettier in person, and extremely comfortable and high quality. i'm 5'3"" and it hits right above the knee. the straps are adjustable and fits true to size. i bought an xs and it fits perfect. must buy for a sweet little night gown!",5
"I ordered this dress with the 25% off everything code as it is a bit expensive. i will say it is well worth the price. from the material, to the design, and fit, i was truly pleased. i am usually a 4p in retailer dresses so i went with the xs-p and it fits perfectly. it is super cute and unique, and i love, love, love the pockets, which is always an added bonus. it is so fun and flattering, as i am sure people will be asking where this one is from. a definite summer must have. obsessed with this w",5
"These are the perfect higher waisted skinny jeans. high enough that there is no muffin top, but not so high they look like mom jeans. typical ag super soft fabric. they are like wearing sweat pants. so worth the extra money for the ag jeans. love the length too.",5
"Very soft and comfortable, great for girls who don't usually like shorts because of bigger/muscular thighs. i would say these run large, but not drastically. for reference, i'm usually a size 6 on the bottom and i got a small. the girl at the checkout counter called them pajama shorts but i think these can definitely be worn out of the house.",5
"I love this top! it flows nicely and fits perfectly. i'm 5' 4 1/2"", 125 lbs. and ordered the small. i love the little bit of sparkle in the blouse, too.",5
"This is a very beautiful dress, with the detail of the inside lining, with a very beautiful fabric as well, creating a double layer effect, it creates a great flow. i am not sure i would use it with the belt (which is beautiful, a part of it is crochet), but if i don't, the dress would be too long. i am a size xl and 5'6"", so if you are shorter than that, i would try it before buying it. since it's getting cold here in colorado, i'll have to wait for next year to really experience going out with",5
"This is a gorgeous flowy top. i paired it with a pair of army green pants and have received a ton of compliments. you can dress this top up for a night out or for work, or style it for a fun evening out. you will be very pleased with this top.",5
"This is a great dress - it definitely runs true to size and is on the border of running a little small. if you're on the fence about which size to order go with the larger size.
the fabric moves nicely but wrinkles easily when packed. love the color.
got a ton of compliments :)",5
"I loved this top from the first time i saw it online. i ordered a size 10 ~i'm slim with broad shoulder & 36c~ the top fit perfect. when i opened the pkg i thought it would be too big since it looked wide but that was not the case at all. its a little longer in the back & a little shorter in the front. on me~it looks exactly like it does in the picture.its really a cute top & it looks lovely over shorts. makes a cute, casual summer outfit. i cant wait to wear it.",5
I bought this top in navy and am so happy with my purchase. it's pretty and feminine. it looks great with jeans as well dressing it up for work. very happy with this purchase.,5
"This is a beautiful shirt. i purchased the top in navy, the silver touch is pretty. i usually wear a size 8 or 10 and m was perfect, tts. great for work or casual party.",5
"The pattern is pretty subtle, almost looks like one color, so it is more versatile as i would have originally thought. the fabric is so soft, the collar is removable, but i love the look with it on. the way it closes is 3 lobster-like clasps, so you can wear it closed or open. sizing is a bit big, as in the xxs p fit me perfectly (didn't even try on the xs p. this will keep me warm, and looked nice with a pant outfit i tried on as well as a dress... recommend (sizing reference: 115 lbs, 30dd, 26",5
"This sweater looks great with chambray colored denim. i wear it with jeans, shift dresses and even leggings. definitely one of my go to sweaters for the fall.",5
"I loved the look of this blouse online. i really wanted a cute eyelet top for summer. the blouse looked great out of the package but the fit was not good. i am a 00p and 32 b bra size, this top was too tight across my chest but billowed out in the back. its as if the armholes were too far forward. it is fairly short but i am short waisted. i really wanted this top to work but i had to return it. if i went up one size the back of the blouse would have been ridiculously large and the top was too e",1
"I bought a size s in the navy, and m in the neutral, and both fit. i usually wear a small, but they only had the size m left in the neutral. the m is a little big, but the extra room fits the flowy, bohemian style of the blouse, so it works. i love this top and am glad i purchased it in both colors. definitely recommend it.",5
"Bought both colors - nice quality top, but they do run large. for reference, i'm 5'4"", 115lbs and xs is still kind of big on me. wish they have xxs.",5
"I love that this top is dressy, yet comfy. it is perfect for work and relaxing with friends after. i recommend purchasing this blouse.",5
These are my favorite flare jeans! they have that lovely 70's style and go with everything and look great all year round. the fit is perfect. my all time favorite jeans.,5
"I love this dress! the pattern is unusual along with the mesh cutouts. i'm a sucker for mesh cutouts. it does look a little bit like a maternity dress, but eh, who cares. let them think what they want. i recently wore it to a casual outdoor wedding and received many compliments. i knocked off one star for quality because the back of the dress where the zipper stops needed to be reinforced by hand to keep it from ripping. this is a common problem i have with retailer dresses, and no i'm not trying",5
"Love this vest! since i am 66 years old i was hesitant to try on this vest because it was out of my comfort zone as to style, but my daughter convinced me to try it on. it is absolutely darling and looked so chic on. my 27 year old daughter bought it, too, so it is stylish for any age. the fur collar is fun and the fabric is very nice and the vest is well made. it can elevate jeans to a dressier look but still have a casual vibe. having a coupon the day we shopped made the decision to buy this e",5
"The fabric is very light weight, more of a shirting material.  this surprised me because the dark flowers almost looked like flocked velvet in the picture.  the flowers are actually printed on cotton that has woven stripes.  it is so soft and light!  there is also a little webbing detail in the front yoke but nothing shows because there is a simple sewn in lining.  the skirt is not lined but the hem is weighted with a trim so that the skirt will hang right.  very flattering.  it does run big tho",5
"I bought this dress for the summer, but it will transition nicely into the fall with a sweater, leggings, and boots. the color and pattern are pretty and without being washed out. the macrame belt is absolutely beautiful. it doesn't show up well in the picture, but is intricate and artistic. seems sturdy as well. i can't wait to wear it out!",5
I love that the dress slip got a different pattern. very easy fun for summer but you can also layer it in fall,5
This maxi dress is exactly what i had in mind! the fabric is very comfortable. the print is very nice. perfect find!,5
"I most often fit into a size medium. based on prior reviews, i ordered this dress in a small and it fits perfectly. it drapes nicely. the fabric is soft and flows well. the under layer has a nice little stretch to it. the dress looks good with and without the belt. my favorite and most-slimming look is to just tie cinch and tie it in the back, such that it does not wrap around the front at all. the dress is so comfortable and the neckline is very flattering. no bra needed for my small bust.",5
I own another pair of this brand and these are just as cute and fit the same. i wish the fabric was a bit nice but they still are super cute. they have wider leg holes which are flattering on my muscular build. nice and lightweight and sooooo comfy!,5
These pants lived up to expectations. the fabric is very soft and did not wrinkle in the dryer. i am normally not a big fan of cropped styles but love that these have the gathered leg and can be styled dressier or casual. i thought the cargo pockets might stick out too much but they lay nicely. i feel i will get a lot of use from these and the best part is they are not constrictive and they are super comfy.,5
This garment has the most beautiful and detailed embroidery on the front and across the top of the back. i purchased this blouse in pale pink in a xs for my daughter-in-law who is an retailer fanatic. i am sure she will look stunning in it. my only negative would be the silver accent thread across the front is overkill.,5
"This top is drop-dead adorable, very well made, and a flattering fit. i noticed other reviewers saying it is wide and short, but that was not my experience. it's a slight ""swing"" or ""trapeze"" shape, but fitted through the shoulders. so, if you are small-shouldered and small in the chest - this is a very, very cute top. for reference, i am 5'4"" and a 32c - and i took a size 2. perfect when paired with dark skinnies or capris. it's also delightfully well made with excellent detailing - the cute vi",5
"This dress is absolutely lovely, from the neckline to the fabric. really feels like a well made dress. i will say that it ran larger than i thought though, so keep that in mind. it is more of a shift dress than the pictures suggest. still gorgeous though!",5
"I'm so glad i saw this in the store, as the online photo does not do it justice. it's elegant, detailed, and a beautiful shade of pink. it has a little silver sparkle which makes it perfect for a casual party when you want to opt out of the traditional holiday colors.",5
"These are so comfortable, it's like wearing jammies outside. i love the pattern and you really can't be the comfort.",5
These jeans are very comfortable. i really like the high waist. just what i was looking for!,5
"Call my corny but this dress inspires me to run barefoot through the lavender fields in provence.  the flowy layers and dreamy prints are mesmerizing.  fit is ideal for my body type as long as you size down.  i had no weird sagging, bagging or poofiness.  and i love the macrame belt!  i tied it offset to the side but the dress looks good unbelted too.  i purchased the small petite. 

my stats for fit reference:  5'3"" tall, 140#, 36dd, 28"" waist, 35"" hips, wide rib cage, size m/l tops, size s/m",5
"I adore the tiny brand blouses! this one is lovely, and i feel new and beautiful in the navy with the sheer sleeves and bumpy, embroidered material, very pretty indeed. this probably is equally stunning in the nude color, but it doesn't show well somehow online. the navy is certainly amazing, and i was so proud to wear this blouse today for work with jeans. i always find the tiny sizing to be one size off. the large fits me perfectly, although i am a medium in most all other tops. 5.1"", 130 #, 3",5
"Love this dress! the colors are a smidgen darker than the photo shows, which i like even better. super comfortable, nice flow, great fit. definitely will be a favorite of mine for this summers",5
This is a wonderful top. it looks great with jeans and shorts. feminine and clever design. many compliments.,5
"These jeans not only fit well, i love the way the fabric feels. for denim the fabric feels soft on the skin. i am 5'8 and the inseam of 30 inches was perfect. they call them ""hi-rise"", but them seem more like a ""mid-rise"" to me which i prefer. i am going to buy another pair in a different wash.",5
The print is awesome !,5
"I just purchased this adorable drop waist dress on-line and personally found it to fit tts in my regular size small (34d-27-35). the length in the front hits right to the top of my knees, perhaps a tad longer so it's not too short for me (i'm only 5'4"") and the back is longer in length. there is also a detachable matching cotton slip that snaps on or off the dress that has adjustable straps that hit just above my knees. i love that this dress was made from cotton and the color is just as picture",5
"I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews. i could barely get this blouse over my head! after getting it on, the armholes too are very small. the blouse other than that is pretty and very girlie. i love the pleating and dolman sleeves but i was strangled around my neck. i tried the small but think a medium wouldn't have been much better. it needs a button opening on neck and sleeves. i would have to put this on before makeup or doing my hair. 
if you have a tiny head and pencil a",1
"This dress got my attention in the store due to the bright color. it's like a tangerine orange that absolutely shouts summer. loved the asymmetrical hem and another plus was the pockets! they look completely hidden so the dress does fall flat. i thought this ran a little big in the chest area, which doesn't happen often. a size 8 worked for me, can't wait to wear this!",5
"The orange version is very nice, bright but not tacky. the fit is super flattering, and i love the crisscrossed hem. the top part is also flattering on the shoulders (halter), but need a strapless bra. the 0 fit me well, no need for petite on that one, might be too short for me.

(03dd, 26.5 in waist, 115 lbs).

pattern is also gorgeous. recommend...",5
"I have an hourglass shape and a large chest, so it's difficult to find dresses that don't like i'm wearing a sack or are too form-fitting to be appropriate. this dress is prefect for accentuating my waist, while still looking appropriate for weddings and other nice events! the color is perfect",5
This will be my favorite fall acquisition! looks better in person. very flattering. does run large. love the combo of tan and grey.,5
"I love this dress. it's a lightweight soft fabric. the blue layer is a bit thin, so you can see the stripped layer underneath which keeps this from being just an ordinary blue dress. usually i'm a size 0xs but got a 2 because i was worried it would be too tight in the shoulders (based on another similar dress from holding horses). the two fits great, the top and waist fit perfect and the bottom is nice and flowy without being too much fabric.",5
"I love this dress. however, it's not what i expected based off the pictures. 

the modeled photo indicates that it's a shirtdress with a drop waist. no. it's a smock dress with more of an a-line silhouette that begins at the shoulders. the waistline is more of a detail, like the button placket, than a structural quality. it's very youthful and whimsical. 

that said, it is quite beautiful. the fabric does not wrinkle easily, as another reviewer guessed. my daughter wrinkled it sitting on my",5
Silhouette transcends many occasions.,5
"I run 170lbs., 36 d, 5'4"" and ordered a regular 14. probably could get away with a 12. i didn't order a petite because i wanted the length. however i ordered the 14 because it is cotton hand wash and thinking there might be some shrinkage. it fits to perfection everywhere - but the waist. it's very loose. they must have clipped it in at the waist in the back of this shot on the model. the picture doesn't clearly show the hi-low concept of the hem. i like that so it isn't a problem. very unique a",5
"Well, i just love this dress. great material. beautiful coloring! perfect length! true to size.
i love the pleated neckline! i feel like an old hollywood beauty in this dress. great one retailer!",5
"I sized down as other reviewers suggested (usually an 8, went down to 6) and the dress fit fine--but it was not attractive. the cut was like a tent with an empire waist. really just not attractive. maybe it has to do with my body type, but compared to the model, this dress was so unflattering in-person. returned.",1
"I never ever buy anything full price when it comes to retailer shopping, love their stuff but way over priced so i patiently watch and wait. this dress though i couldn't do it, i had to have it. i think it is a fabulous addition to my summer collection and i look forward to wearing it in a few weeks to a july 4th get away. get it while you can.",5
"Love this dress, it's comfortable
and it can be worn casualties or formally.",5
"I saw this dress on sale online and it was available at my local retailer. i tried it on and went with the xs, i'm 5'4 130lbs, 34c and it fit great with some room. tts the material is fabulous and it comes with a matching green slip which is great.",5
"Beautiful color, great quality! on sale too. a must have!",5
"This blouse is beautiful and true to size. i was so happy it fit after ordering it online. i'm a bit busty and broad but generally wear a m in most retailer tops and the m fit perfectly. length was perfect on me...not too long and not short. i'm 5'1"" for reference. definitely a top that can be worn dressed up with slacks and heels or skinny jeans and flats. love it!",5
"I love the lacy details on the skirt. this dress is perfectly simple, yet can be dressed up too. as the evenings get cooler, it pairs up nicely with a cropped denim jacket or a cardigan.",5
I was so excited to get this dress...i even paid expedited shipping! i read the reviews and thought that i ordered properly but i sadly disappointed. it was just too big. i'm a size 6-8 petite and the size 8 was overwhelming. the side of the dress were down to my stomach and i just can't wear the dress. not sure what to do but buyers be careful. pretty color and design but not well-designed.,1
I ordered xs/s. i usually wear medium in tops and coats. the next size up would've been too big so this cape does run large.,5
I didn't notice this online but it caught my eye in the store. the colors are bright and beautiful. i wear a 10/12 or m/l. i tried the 12 but the bust was too big (i wear a 36c). i ordered the size 10 and it fits perfect. i'm so glad i saw it in the store. i think it makes much more of an impact in person than online.,5
"I have the pink plaid pippa and this mint one is nothing like it, but in a good way.  shorter, sweet embroidery but the same swing silhouette and drop waist style.  this dress is a little oversized so if you want more fitted look, you can size down.  stay tts if your busty like me.  imo, the mint looks more sky blue than green.  i got the medium regular and i'm 5'3"" 140# 36dd and ends at my knees.",5
"Just got this dress and am very pleased.  fell in love with the bright color in the store and then came home ordered it at a great sale price!!  color is as shown...beautiful lace trim at the bottom.....back longer than front as described and pockets!!  i am 5'2"" and length on a large comes to just below the knees..in front....i may wear leggings under it...dont like the slip as it is far too tight...will wear a tee or turtle under it..  quality heavier fabric. roomy... linen and cotton.",5
"I just got this dress in the mail, and i have to disagree with the previous reviewer.. the embroidery on the dress is so well done and thick. the material is high quality and although breathable, holds up perfectly to the embroidery.. i usually order an extra small in loose fitting dresses, and ordered the extra small in this one. i'm 5'4"", 117 pounds, with a curvy build. the xs was more fitted, which i wanted. i can belt it or wear it loose. did i mention the color? vibrant rich green. can't wa",5
I thought this dress was lovely on. i'm an 8/10 and tried the med which i believe was the right fit. it may have fit a little large but i liked the way it hung. it has pockets and the color is absolutely beautiful. definitely buying if it makes it to sale.,5
"I ordered xs petite. which they are sold out of. but in case you are a different size i wanted to write a review. i'm 5 feet tall and 120 lbs. i am 34  d so busty. the petite did not overwhelm me. the pockets do open. you're supposed to cut the little threads out. ask a dry cleaner or an retailer stylist for help. i like that there is a little ""stiffness"" to the cape. it has holes for your arms. not a poncho. your lucky if they have your size!",5
I love this dress. i wish i had ordered a size bigger because now its out of stock. if you are between sizes order a size up. i'm in between a 4 and a 6 petite and ordered the size 4 and the dress is too tight in the bust. the dress has no give so it has to fit perfect. it is so lovely i don't want to return it. i will try to find a seamstress to help with the fit. my favorite part of the dress are the side pockets. they're big and adorable.,5
"Great sweater. long and warm, but not too thick. i am 5'4"" and ordered a medium. fits and hangs nicely.",5
"Beautiful in person! highly recommend: great quality, beautiful design, flattering!",5
"Gorgeous shirt! the detail on this shirt is impeccable! even with its boxy shape, it was very flattering on my petite, curvy frame. i'd say this shirt runs just a tad big. i'm 5' 118lbs and the xs fit perfectly.",5
I bought this late in the season and love the way it fits and looks.,5
"Perfect denim top! the fabric/material is great and of good quality. there is a structure to the top, but it really makes the looks. the quality is amazing and the top can be styled in so many ways. for the quality, a definite must buy!",5
"I know it's for warm weather, but i am more excited to use as a layering piece for fall/ winter. i bought 2 sizes a 4 & 6, because i wasn't sure on size. the 6 was way big on me, but the boxy cut of the 4 left enough room for a shirt or light sweater underneath.",5
I love how feminine and interesting this top is. what i especially like is that you can layer different colored camis underneath to get a completely different look. the weight of the material makes it appropriate for all seasons. it is very well made and is something you can wear to work and also wear if you are going out afterward.,5
"I ordered this because i can&#39;t resist denim shirts.  i love the unusual shape for a tank top and the full-length, bronze zipper in the back is to die for.  it looks great with everything!",5
"This skirt is gorgeous. i love the dots, the heavy fabric, the slight metallic in the weave. it also has two exposed zippers, one on either side of the waist, which gives it an edgy vibe. a perfect counter balance to the 50s circle skirt cuteness. however, not knowing my size in tracy reese, i ordered my usual retailer size 4. i cannot even zip it. i measured it and the size 4 has a 24 inch waist. there is about an inch of give in the band, but the elastic is so heavy it would not be flattering to",5
"I love the look of this top. my original order was returned because of a defect but the customer service was wonderful. they took it back at the store and sent out another one right away.
the style is very flattering and the quality of the denim is excellent.
love the back zipper as well.",5
"I found this top in my local store. there were two colors available, this coral color and a deep teal color. i purchased the teal in a m, which is one size down from my normal size. it drapes beautifully. it is a tunic length, but not too long. i love the way it makes my shoulders look. i have athletic shoulders, and halter styles are best in the summer for me. this tank will require a strapless bra, i plan to wear a bandeau but i am not very big up top. anyhow, love this top. if it gets release",5
"I think the orange top will look great in the fall as well as spring. i'm 5' 7.5"" and it's a great tunic length on me. it's really pretty and i love it. snap it up on sale!",5
I love this top. i purchased it in an xs and feels it is tts. it can be dressed up or down. i recently paired this with the cloth and stone chambray drawstring shorts and it was the perfect summer outfit. the button details in the back are such a nice touch. i got many compliments on this top.,5
"This blouse is gorgeous. first of all, it's cotton! so, it is extremely comfortable. it isn't tighter in some areas more than others, but fits evenly throughout, which although a rarity, is wonderful. finally, a blouse that fits perfectly! i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i ordered the regular xs and it hits right at my hips. i have a longer torso, however, so although i am not tall, the petite would have been too short for me. it is beautifully made and the red is a beautiful crimson on white. grab th",5
"This piece is just gorgeous. you will almost never catch me paying full price for a clothing item, but today i did! i've been admiring it online, and when i noticed it had sold out (the red version) online, i stopped by a store to see if they had it in stock. well, it looks even more gorgeous in person, and i snapped it up right away. i envision myself wearing this all summer long and beyond.",5
"Normally i like to purchase from the store so i can try things on first, but this top wasn't available locally. i guessed on a medium. i'm 5'5"" and very curvy and the medium fits just like the picture on the model. just a hint of a sleeve and nice and drapey-loose over the body. the embroidery is just beautiful. the only reason i'm not giving 5 stars for quality is that i had to sew two buttons onto the back, my top came without them.",5
This skirt is so cute. the fix print is really nice. it's a great piece to add to the fall wardrobe.,5
"I love how unique this top is, especially the buttons that run on the back.
it is cut boxy, but i think it works because there is so much other detail going on. the fabric is comfortable, and the stitching on the inside is not irritating.",5
Such great detail great beautiful in red and white.,5
"This top is so cute and so comfy. i love the details, especially in the back. this embodies what i love about retailer clothing- the little unique touches that you find anywhere else. very pleased.",5
"I initially saw this top a few months ago, and fell in love. it ended up selling out in stores, so i ordered it online, where it was back-ordered by a couple of months. i received it this past week, and was sadly disappointed. the design is pretty, but overall the quality is sorely lacking. i wonder if maybe the first batch was good, but when they realized they were so popular, and had more made, the newer batches weren't as good? not sure. the one i got had inconsistent red embroidery, and ther",1
"Cute top. a little delicate. my top arrived with a rip in the sleeve. fortunately, my tailor was able to fix it.",5
"Luckily i found this in the store though it is on backorder online, so if you really want it - go to/call the store. it's effortless, fun, beautiful, and nicely detailed. love this top. i'm 5'5"" and usually wear size 6, and i bought a small. really worth the price b/c you can just throw it on and look fabulous. layers well. so happy i got this.",5
Very pretty. love the design both front and back,5
"This is a beautiful top, the pattern reminds me very much of mola designs stitched in panama. i love the contrast of the red stitching against the white background. i'm not as crazy about the buttons on the back sides- not sure what that detail adds to the piece. it is a boxy shape, so be aware it's not going to hug the figure. the cotton is soft and medium weight. overall, it's a stand-out!",5
"Absolutely in love with this top. the embroidery and back button detail make for a unique and fun look. light and airy material will be perfect in warmer weather with a cute pair of shorts. i got a size small and it fits perfectly. measurements: 5'4, 135lbs, 32e",5
Most often complimented item of this spring's wardrobe,5
"I wound up returning this shirt, because i ordered the wrong size! so sad. i should have sized down. i'm tall, and long waisted, but slight on top. 

the shirt is gorgeous, and the detailing is perfectly done. i'd definitely recommend trying this one. just choose your size carefully..",5
"This shirt feels so special. it is mainly t shirt material so i will be dry cleaning to make sure it keeps
it's shape and delicate feel. the stitching is so beautiful! i'll wear this with jeans and even my navy pencil skirt for work. so cute!",5
"Absolutely love this top! i've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top, something that'd be ideal for summertime. this beautiful piece doesn't disappoint. the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning. not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have. highly recommend.",5
"This has lovely embroidery of good quality, and it is nicely lined in the embroidered section too. it is a very loose swingy shape, so size down.",5
"I love this dress. it's beautiful and flattering. not to mention that it is also comfortable with a bit of stretch. i couldn't see it in the picture, but the black parts on the shoulders in front and on the back is sheer, so you have to be careful with underwear choice. i have an apple shape and yet this was flattering and the perfect length. i am short and apple-shaped and it was a great choice.",5
"These are my favorite jeans. the fabric is soft but has a good amount of weight to them. all the details reflect a high quality jean. i usually have a very hard time finding jeans that fit my backside and thighs well without a huge gap at the waist. these sit lower on my hips, no gap, and plenty of space for my butt. they do run a bit large though. i have a 29"" natural waist and think a 28 would have been even more perfect.",5
"I love this top!! i got lucky and found it returned at a store (always always check the ""found and collected racks ladies!) it was a 6 and i was a little worried it would be much to large, but it fit great! i like that i can wear something under it or on its own. i didn't fit it too short, but i'm a little under 5'7"" and roughly 127 lbs, 32/34a. highly recommend!",5
This shirt is really cute.  i love the color and design.  i like wearing it with jeans and sneakers.,5
"Gorgeous color, flowy fabric, unique design - this top is a winner. i don't even mind that i'll have to wear a strapless bra with it! a little bit on the larger size, but not too big in my opinion.",5
"Love this! saw online, didn't place the order and when i came back it was gone. retailer restocked so i got it second time around. ordered the red option. this shirt is beautiful! sometimes the online photos don't do the piece justice, but this time, it's even better in person. the embroidered detail is gorgeous, the fabric is light weight, and the back of the shirt has button down panels that are almost linen-like in look and feel. the fit is just as pictured imo. bringing this on vacation with m",5
"I recently bought this blouse, the soft fabric drapes nicely and the stitching is wonderful. love it!",5
"Gorgeous embroidery, soft fabric, great drape, hides tummy--overall perfect.  size down.  i bought the small and i am 36dd.",5
Love the fit and color of this top. i love that it is somewhat fitted around the arm holes which doesn't allow for extra skin to show. it drapes nicely over my hips and tummy. got rave reviews from my husband!!,5
"This is such a unique and beautiful top. it will be a go-to in my closet all year round. the red embroidery is amazing. meant to be a loose fit. i'm 5'7"" and 120 lbs and ordered the xs. fits perfectly.",5
"Beautiful,lightweight and well tailored 
more dressy than what it appears in photo",5
"Form fitting, hugs in the right spots, and love the pattern. it's a little shorter than i expected and too formal to wear to work. however, an excellent evening dress.",5
Love these jeans!!! they are the perfect fit from waist to ankles. their first wear was like i'd been wearing them for years. i paired them with the pintuck button-down tunic.,5
"Really gorgeous print! i purchased these to go with the top (also recommend it as well) and i love these! i have a larger behind, and it's nowadays it seems to find swimsuits with full coverage without feeling like a diaper - these are it. there is elastic at the leg openings, so that may be uncomfortable for some, but i found no problem with it. for reference, i am usually a 6/8 28/29 in pants, and i purchased a medium.",5
"It might look a bit stiff from the photo, but this fabric is so soft and really is a fashionable sweatshirt!",5
"This blouse is perfect in so many ways: it's cotton, the fit is super flattering, the design is gorgeous. i never, and i mean never, wear red, but i made an exception here due to the exceptionally stunning embroidery. i know this will be comfortable this summer; the fit is slightly loose, so the air can flow. the cotton is light but not thin, no cami needed. a medium size fits me very well; i am size 8/medium top, 34f, 130#. i love that the armholes are high and hide any flaws. the button design",5
This is a unique take on a denim shirt! i have about five other denim shirts but love this style.,5
"Love this top, runs true to size. looks cute with in style army green cargo pants.  great buy at sale price.",5
"The back of this top is very unique and the embroidery looked like it would hold up.
it does have a boxy shape, but it really works with this piece. i found it to run true to size compared to other pieces i have from retailer. for some reference, i'm 5'5"" and weigh 148lbs.",5
What a cute shirt! i got the red and white and it's definitely a summer shirt although i'm sure you could make it look cute under a cardigan. i'm a 10 m and the m fit well. tts.,5
"I love this top! usually i prefer neutral colors, but i looked at every one of the colors, and fell in love with the pink. i think it looks the best with the embroidery at the top. i too love this cut on my shoulders for summer. i would definitely recommend this top. i bought an xs and it's perfect. this shirt made me feel like twirling, i love it.",5
"Soft and stylish - my usual large seems a bit too large, so i will try a medium.",5
"Was really excited for this dress but should have paid more attention to the material it was made with. for the price of the dress, it felt very cheap. i didn't even end up trying it on after i opened the packaging. the colors were not as vibrant as the picture. as another reviewer mentioned, it was more similar to something you would purchase off a boardwalk. very disappointed and will be returning.",1
"These pants are amazingly soft and comfortable. they can be worn with cute flats and a dressier top/accessories to work or with a simple tee or tank with tennies for running errands or lounging around. these are great for multiple seasons. i'm 5'2 so they are a little long but the ruched ankle makes that look by ""by design"".",5
"This is a really great bathing suit top. i haven't purchased a bikini in about 4 years so i'm glad this is the one i finally purchased. the floral pattern is dainty and gorgeous. the fabric itself is soft and comfortable. i listed it as a 'true to size' fit, but if you're on the larger end of your size spectrum i would get the size up for better coverage. i'm a size 8 through and through, and so ordered a m per their size standards. the size m was comfortable and fit but the size l covered bette",5
Really nice green blend of colors. fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum. i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket. is a bit itchy. need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath.,5
"Love the shirt. exteemely comfortable, simple and nice.",5
My new favorite piece of loungewear. super cute and comfortable.,5
"When i tried them on, i didn't want to take them off! they are so soft, so stylish, they drape your body just the right way, they are stretchy, so even though i am wearing 30 in jeans, i took s regular! run hone and tried it on with moss cowled side-zip tunic, 2 different booties and aquaflora reversible vest, all variations and combos looked really cool and great! i even tried with high heeled booties and dressier sweater top (warm-up pullover in charcoal), looked like high couture! the color i",5
"I ordered the black 2 months ago, it was on back order, and i jsut received it finally. the fabric is super soft, itried on both xxs and xs and could keeo either one. the ""v"" in front where it crosses is low, so most people do need a cami underneath, but you could probably do without for ultra sexy look (not my style, but could be done). i plan on wearing this with skirts, deresses and slacks... i saw a commet on the lighter color, not sure, but love this one in black for sure@",5
"I've been looking for a wrap cardigan for a while and this totally fit the bill. it fits well, is soft, and made of good materials. i love the versatility of using it with all my dresses. this is a great staple piece.",5
I love this dress! it is equally pretty in person too. sometimes i will order things and when i get them the colors are totally different than what i anticipated. not with this dress. i love it and will get a lot of use out of it over the spring/summer.,5
"This dress is so pretty; can be worn casually or with heels to dress up! i get so many compliments on it, and it's so comfortable, it's like wearing pajamas! i highly reccomend it.",5
"And the bottom looks like a tutu. first, i have high tolerance for scratchy fabric but this one i could feel it even through long sleeves. there is no way i could wear something that makes my skin itch so badly. second, the peplum part is huge and looks like an exaggerated skirt. finally, the color on the ""green one"" is darker than in the picture and it does have more of a green than blue tint. back it goes.",1
"I was thinking this was another maeve winner but this is actually plenty by tracy reese dress. i love the flowy fabric, the soft but vibrant colors and the gorgeous print. i wanted a size mp but that sold out so i purchased a regular m (with the intention to hem) and i find it too large in the bust. i'm going to order the sp instead too see if that fits better. for reference i am 5'3"" 36dd 140#.",5
"Knitted and knotted makes such gorgeous sweaters:  this is bathed in lovely, almost impresssionistic color, and the deep ruffle at the bottom is feminine and flattering.  i adored the way there's enough wrap-around to get cozy in it, as i wore it through my day.  i went with the green in a regular medium, which is my normal size:  size 8, 34f.  the 27% mohair enhances the soft feeling and lush look.  as i wore this piece today, i felt that i was wearing something very special.",5
"I can't get enough of this dress! this dress is everything. from the flattering fit, to the colors and pattern, to the design, and to the quality.. this dress really has it all. this is worth every penny and in my opinion, a great price for a versatile, high quality dress. the material is that super comfy, stretchy material which is perfect for everyday! it is a no brainer and easy to throw on. i'm so happy it comes in petite as the xsp length fits me perfect! it hits at the perfect length for a",5
"This sweater is stunning. it is extremely well made. tons of tiny little embellishments that get noticed even by the most discerning eye! i've received so many compliments on it. if you want it to fit generously or with extra roominess, i recommend ordering one size up. it fits true to size.",5
"I also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it.  i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it.  the fabric is made of cheap poly that's shiny, thin, and clingy.  it shows every lump and bump you have.  the zipper at the back won't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump.  the sewing and hemline is uneven.  there wasn't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline",1
"These culottes are beautiful! really pretty cerise shade with a nice eyelet pattern. they are only partially lined. the size small, my normal size, was falling off of me so i sized down to extra small which fit perfectly.",5
I've read the previous reviews about this dress and was hesitant to order it but i'm so happy i did! i can definitely understand why certain reviews are saying that the fabric is cheap. it is an extremely thin material as well as a thin lining.  however i think it depends on the person. because neither of those things actually bother me. i get hot very easily so i appreciate the fact that this dress is very thin and flowy.  i think it's extremely comfortable and looks very cute on.  the zipper d,5
"Perfection.  fits like other pilcto jackets and vests.  tapers in slightly at waist for flattering fit   weight is light for summer but substantial and good quality.  silver buttons, not bronze or copper.  slight stretch, super comfy.  no regret!",5
"I love eva franco 
this is a very poor version ! bias seams are puckery... zipper is bubbled 
felt great looked like fun but too much if a mess to be fixed.",1
The sweater is as cute in person as it is online.,5
Such a festive sweater and i've received many compliments anytime i wear it. unique and fun to wear!,5
"Do not buy this dress for full price. the design looks great but after receiving the dress, the material is made of extremely cheap slinky-ish polyester that you would find at a f21 store. the stitching is horrific and created an uneven ""hump"" on the back seam. just absolutely poor poor quality.",1
"This sweater is absolutely gorgeous. the design and structure might make your shoulders look a little bigger, but i absolutely love it. it has a little boxy shape but i feel like it goes with te style. love it! get tons of compliments every time i wear it.",5
Fits well and appropriate for work or going out! love the pop of red in the beads! could easily be worn with a jacket well into fall! i typically wear a 6 and a small fit perfectly. not too short- but hits above the knee! this will get lots of wear!,5
This is a great dress that can be dressed up or worn with flip flops. i also love that it has pockets :),5
I tried this dress on in the store and loved it. i am not a aize 2 (usually a 6) but the dress's a-line shape allowed me to get a size 2. the dress is well made and the orange beaded work is lovely. a very pretty dress that i will wear a lot.,5
The color and fit of this dress is fabulous. i can't wait to wear it out.. casual with flats or dressy with heels. love it!,5
Im so glad this shirt came to me just as pictured and described. color and fit was spot on! thank you!,5
"This dress is just beautiful - color, fit, length, style, stretchy fabric...everything about it seems to flatter all body types. it also passes the armhole test - no issues there! the back closure detail adds a little something special to it. i tried it on with black leggings and a black leather jacket just for fun, and it looks surprisingly cute for multi-season wear. is it overpriced? absolutely, but so is 99% of the stuff at retailer. i will be keeping it anyway though because i think it's a tr",5
"I don't usually go for swing style dresses as i am petite, but this one was totally cute. i like the color a lot, wasn't sure it would work as i am rather pale, but it is nice. the xs p was returned at my store, why i tried it on... winner. 115 lbs, 26.5 in waist, 30dd chest. i can see myself wearing this in summer, spring or fall (with boots).",5
This suit is great for curvy and slightly flawed figures. the vintage look delivers full coverage that still looks sexy. not your mother's one-piece.,5
"Love it! this suit is high quality and comfortable. it's a little tricky to get on but once it's on, it's perfect. i have a small chest and the fit of the cups and twisted fabric makes me feel totally comfortable. i usually wear two pieces, in fact this is my first one piece since i was ten, and i love it.",5
Love this dress...light and comfortable and fits true to size. i have larger shoulders and the halter design is really flattering. you can dress up or dress down which is a huge plus for me!,5
"This swimsuit is super cute and retro. the ruching on the stomach is very flattering and the shaping on the padded cups makes for a very nice hourglass 1950s-inspired look. great for us ladies without a lot up top. i felt very marilyn monroe in this suit! i love the back coverage, too -- your butt doesn't hang out of the suit and the boyshort style offers a good amount of coverage without being dowdy.

i was worried about sizing when i first ordered it. based on what everyone said, i went with a",5
"I saw this dress in the window at the roc center nyc store and knew i had to have it. the one i chose has muted earth-tone colors of tan, green, gold. looks stunning with my complexion. the blue one was nice too, but the earth tones were more flattering on me.  the fit is loose and flowy, very comfortable, but not baggy. i'm 5'5, 34c, 115ish and i took my usual xs. i plan to pair it with a muted green leather jacket and brown boots for the fall. can't wait!",5
"Love this top. fits true to size. not to boxy,, sleeves are so cute! looks very rich. a must have in your wardrobe!",5
"I ordered in blue. so excited at arrival; it looked gorgeous...then i tried it on! i'm 5', 106#, 34d and my upper arms are a little muscular. i normally order 2p (sometimes 0p)...and never a problem. this top was sooo tight under the arms and at the upper arms...if i tried any movement would have probably ripped out the seams! maybe i just received a product that was mis-sized, or defective. all i can say, if you have skinny arms, you'll love it.",1
I love love this top.  it is so pretty!  i am stopped by strangers complimenting me on it. it is so flattering.  i wear a cami under it and find it perfect!  it hits at the perfect length below the waist on my jeans.  it's easy to throw on and go.  casual but dressy.  the sleeves do bell out so you may need to watch them when you eat.  i've accidentally caught them on my plate.  the shirts washes well.,5
"I ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color! looks great with my blonde hair. the bell sleeves, which are all the rage right now, add to the feminine look. i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look!",5
"I absolutely love the retro look of this swimsuit. i first saw it on blogger amber fillerup-clark (barefoot blonde) and i knew i had to have it. this is the first one piece suit i've purchased in about six years. i've avoided one pieces because most of the ones i tried made me feel frumpy, and the mono-kini look just looked odd on me. i have a smaller frame and a larger bust (32ddd), so finding swimsuits that fit properly is a challenge. i am a size 4 but i ordered a size 6 after reading reviews",5
Love the fit of pilcro jeans. it's always a struggle to find a white jean that is flattering around the thighs and doesn't show off lumps and bumps! these are terrific quality indeed.,5
"I got this top in white/rust and it is darling. the lining keeps it from being too see through. the bell sleeves add style without getting in the way thanks to the shorter length. i get many compliments each time i wear it. i am 5'1"", 103 lbs and take xs- fit was true to size.",5
"I ordered the correct size due to reading other reviews who gave their height , weight, and chest size. thank you all for that! i am 5 feet 5 3/4 inches tall and fluctuate between 135 lbs and 139 lbs. i wear 36b in bras. i ordered an 8. fits great! the coverage is adequate on my backside. the rouching is very nice in the mid section for self conscious women like me. the color is fun and beautiful. the quality is excellent! i love the bra support! there are real bra cups sewn in! it was pricey bu",5
"Love this dress.fabric is very soft and flattering. i paired it with wine suede boots. great material, i will be able to wear it most of the year with different accessories. i am fairly busty so i sometimes order an xl but read the reviews and ordered a large and was just fine. great go to dress!",5
Saw this in my local retailer and thought it was stunning. i usually wear a size 8 because of my broad shoulders but ended up taking a 6 in this top. it was not tight in the arms (don't have super skinny arms) and the fabric flows nicely (not too much). the embroidery is amazing and am sure this top will be in rotation quite a bit!,5
"The color and fit is amazing on this dress. i am 5""7 and went with the small and the length wasn't too short either.",5
"I am in love with these jeans!! i can't say enough about them. they are so forgiving yet keep their shape great. they are soft, comfortable and are a great color. these jeans have the perfect amount of stretch while being substantial and durable.",5
"I ordered this last week and received it yesterday and have to say it is a lovely dress. the fabric is light but looks quite rich, making one want to touch the textile. the dress pattern reminds me of a missoni. oh, the dress is lined. i purchased the blue pattern, and am planning on wearing it to work on friday.",5
"Dress it up or go casual - this dress has it all. well made and comfortable where other ""lace"" rubs the wrong way under arms - this is super soft. cant wait to pair different shoe colors and jewelry.",5
"The cut of this dress is what drew me to order it, but it is so much more! first, the fabric is more of a raw silk, which is more like a soft linen than silk.. it's also got a very soft lining that feels great on the skin, and it has pockets! love a dress with pockets! i also love that the design is on the front and back. i am 5' 4"", 133 lbs and a 36c, and ordered a size 6. it's a little big on the sides, so i probably should've returned it for a 4, but it wasn't big enough to make it annoying o",5
Beautiful dress that is easy to just throw on and go. i bought both colors. though it is loose it is still flattering. it has a good length and movement. i'm normally a m/l or 10/12. i took a medium as it is pretty loose fit.,5
"This top is so perfect for the fall... flowy, beautiful embroidery and paired with jeans and brown boots,gorgeous! wore it once and got a lot of compliments!  i'm 5'2"" 125 and ordered a size 4. 2 worked too but just a tad tight in the arms. :)",5
"This sweet dress is perfect for fall and spring because the knit is not too thick, the drape allows layers and the colors are very versatile.  the style is loose if you stay tts but will be a slimmer fit if you size down.  if your body habitus is super slender, definitely size down.  the liner slip is soft and the back side of the knit is a bit scratchy.  i think this dress is beautiful and best of all, forgiving.  i'm happy to have tried both colors--the problem is picking which one to keep!  m",5
I wish summer was longer so i could have the opportunity to wear this more. much more eye-catching and unique in person than the photo. 5 stars.,5
Love this dress. i wore it with black boots and got so many compliments super comfortable.  i feel like this dress will never go out style.,5
"I saw these on the freshly cut + promo discount & decided to order my usual size 28 reg in pilcro. a great fit & appreciate the midrise. not too snug or baggy. look pretty much on me as in the model pic except they fall abt 1"" below my ankles. i am only 5'3"" so not a surprise they are a little longer on me but it's really ok. fyi - the front button & back pocket tacks are gold which gives a classy look to these jeans. just love.. & love the price too! 5'3"", 117#",5
"I am a huge fan of tracy reese because her dresses are works of art, great quality, and super wearable for both work and play, and this is no exception. i purchased this dress in regular xs (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips) and it falls right above my knees. for the office or more conservative setting, i add a belt and a sweater. otherwise, i wear it alone for a carefree look. i chose the regular size because the dress is voluminous and it gets about an inch shorter when i belt it, and it looks",5
"I like this dress. the floral pattern and little red beads. others may think it is baggy, however, i like this type of the style.",5
"This dress is very comfortable, not itchy at all and looks great. runs on the large side and is a tiny bit unflattering in the middle but it's still a worthwhile buy!",5
The dress runs large so if you go down a size you will be fine. looks awesome on. love it. would definitely recommend,5
I ordered a small. i'm usually a petite small. i like my tees not fitted. i will exchange it for an xs. soft. it has like the look of a seam down the middle of the back. i barely noticed it. i think it makes a plain tee shirt a little unique. good quality. 100 percent cotton. it's a white tee. soft.,5
"Let me start by saying i am incredibly picky about pants. i hate probably 99% of the pants i try on. pilcro is the consistent exception, and these are probably my favorites of all my pilcros (perhaps tied with the cords). runs true to pilcro size, which i find to be a bit large--most of my other pants are a 30, and a 29 is quite comfortable in these. despite being leggings, they're thick/structured enough to wear to work.",5
"Flattering, flirty, bright, beautiful romper. i wish it come in other colors because i want more!!!!",5
"Just received my second pair of pilcro legging jeans; having bought them last year as well. great for work, girls night out, date night. so comfortable, with lots of stretch; fortunately they hold their shape and don't stretch out. they feel like pjs, but are nice enough for work. my pair from last year have held up well (color-wise), however some of the leg seam stitching unraveled-- hence the reason for 4 stars in quality. hopefully, these will fare better.

regardless, i highly recommend!",5
"Great top. i bought it for my daughter and it is well made and the fabric is very nice. she is 5'4"" and it reaches just the top of her jeans.",5
"Love this top! however, i'm biased bc i love hd, such originality in their clothing, even in something as simple as a black tank top. also comes with the bra strap snaps, but i find my straps still show in the back, need to wear a strapless or criss cross. please note that the sides sort of rise up to meet the laces. so the more you tighten the laces, the more it comes up (hard to explain!). if you are at all even a little sensitive about a muffin top, again with low rise, it would show! still l",5
I love these shorts. i don't understand why they aren't sold out yet! they are buttery soft and fit great. i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size. they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even. love!!,5
"I am 5'8"" 135 lbs, broad shoulders and normal waste to hip ratio. this jumper fits beautifully and material flows just enough to be forgiving but flattering. love love love, definitely happy with myself for the splurge. can't wait to wear it out!!!",5
Stevie styled ags are my favorite! love the waist! love the length of the short! not to long and not too short,5
"I tried this top on in the store today and had to have it! i love the laces up the sides and the zipper in back. it is short - i found a really cute pair of ""baggy"" pants with a black pattern to pair with it.
in retailer shirts i wear an xs or s - or a 0 or 2. i got this in a 0 and it fit perfectly.",5
"I love this jacket. i'm 6' tall, 160lbs, 30"" waist and a 34d. i normally go for an 8/medium and i bought a medium. i love it! slightly cropped, barely snug fit but i can still snap it closed. totally warm enough for california fall/winter. i like that the sleeves don't have sherpa in them... make it easier to layer! i bought the ""silver"" corduroy and it's less white than the photos, but it still fits the bill perfectly. love that it's machine washable, too. it also has pockets!",5
This is one of my favorite pair of pants. they don't stretch out while wearing and wash well. no pilling or shrinking. they can either be worn like leggings or pants. i wear a size 2 pants but got these in a 27 because i don't like them super fitted.,5
"Ok, so this is true to size-- i recently had a baby (i gained a lot of weight), am in the process of losing it and took the risk of buying a jumpsuit online. i am 5'3 with a long torso, short legs, and a big fat butt so buying pants (especially rompers) are almost impossible. lengthwise, this fits me like pants. the draping is so flattering and the color combination is splashy but not loud. i had to review this as soon as i realized it fit. i don't think i've ever been so happy with an retailer pu",5
"This is a cute,somewhat dressy top-- it has a bit of a sheen, ties on the sides, and a zipper down the back. it'll go great with pants or skirts. the fit, though, is huge-- i'm normally an 8, but i got this in a 4! machine-washable even though it says ""dry clean."" if it doesn't say ""dry clean only,"" you can wash it.",5
Awesome top. slightly cropped. great to dress up jeans or wear with pants or skirt for evening out.,5
Great bra. fits well. works under tighter t-shirts. just be aware that the straps do clearly read calvin klein. more mauve than pink.,5
Love this sweater skirt by tracy reese. i'm a huge fan of tracy reese clothing and this skirt doesn't disappoint. super comfortable. the colors in the skirt are amazing too. many different colors to pull from. i can see myself dressing this up or dressing it down with flat boots and a denim jacket. i felt it fit tts. i usually wear a small in retailer skirts that aren't numeric sizes. got this one in small.,5
"I can't say enough about this sweater! it light, delicate, soft, vintage chic........i could go on and on! buy it already!!!",5
"I am 5'3"" and 34c and bought the regular xs. it fits exactly as on the model. soft and light and comfortable, but very sheer. cami required (have to try this with both a tucked in cami and a cami bra). great with midi skirts and culottes and maxi skirts and palazzo and flared pants. love!",5
"I ordered this skirt in my usual xs. when it arrived it looked tiny. the xs was almost impossible to get on. i ended up returning the xs for a medium, which fit perfectly (and is work appropriate). my measurements are 5'6"" and 125. my recommendation would size up two sizes.",5
"Like one of the previous reviewers, when my jacket arrived, it was not in the great dark wash pictured online. it was in a basic, medium denim wash. i like the wash pictured online; i did not like the wash the jacket came in. additionally, know that it is just huge. i ordered my usual size (medium) and understood that the jacket was meant to be roomy and swingy, but there is no way that one size down would be enough to compensate for how swimmingly large it was. i never tried an xs, but it was s",1
"I absolutely love this bra-it is the most comfortable, aesthetically pleasing sports bra i have ever owned. i love the straps! they take some patience to get aligned properly once the bra is one, but afterward it looks amazing. the bra itself is soft and the padded inserts actually stay in place without much manipulation so they are aligned properly. when moving, i do not have any areas that rub or get irritated uncomfortably. i absolutely love this bra. it gives me the support i need for a high",5
"I was very happy to receive this as a birthday gift. i usually wear an xs or s in clothes i buy from retailer. i was given this in a s, but it wasn't even close to meeting in the front, so i returned it for a m. it doesn't button anyway, but i didn't want it to look like it wouldn't meet at all. i tried on a size s sweater in this brand while i was in the store, and it fit perfectly, so this one is just running small. overall, i love the lace detail on the front and the softness of the sweater.",5
"I joked with my husband that if i were with the resistance  (star wars), this is what i would wear! i actually really like it. it will look best with a girly skirt and blouse. the quilting is lightweight and the fit is slim. well made too.",5
"If you like a slightly heavier, non/clingy basic tee, this is it. i wore the long sleeved version all fall and winter, rotating colors, and i've been wearing these with shorts and leggings since i got them. the colors are great, fabric is quality, and the ribbon detail in the back gives these a little flare.",5
"This is a lightweight sweater...good for the office and summer evenings.  here in so. cal it's a good weight sweater year round.  love the lace trim.  runs a bit large but not too bad.  color is a light cornflower blue, not lavender.  this works for me but if you're looking for a lavender sweater, you might want to think twice.",5
"I have this tee in every single color and love it. this shirt is so soft, airy, and comfortable, and the ribbon embellishment on the back dresses it up a little. i love wearing leggings or skinny jeans with it and accessorizing with an infinity scarf. i normally wear a size small, but i sized up to a medium this time. there is very little difference in the two sizes, but i liked the modest increase in length. i'm glad that i did this, because the tees shrunk ever so slightly after being in the d",5
"This skirt is very comfortable and moves well. i'm 5'4"" and ordered a 2p, which fits perfectly. the length hits just above the top of my feet. the patterned chiffon is sheer and the skirt has a short black slip underneath that ends just above my knees. i have a small waist and wider hips, but found the inner slip to fit loosely enough so that it doesn't ride up when i walk or sit. the two slits on either side were a great length and make this skirt both flirty and quirky. you'll get tons of comp",5
This top is fun. loose but still flattering. the colors are nice and the fabric soft. can fit well. (115lbs 30 dd),5
"This vest is perfect! i live in florida aka where it is hot almost every day of the year. it makes a great layer piece, but isn't too warm!",5
"Just bought this today in xl and i like it a lot. i am very busty so if i see an xl in most things i will try it on. i probably could have fit into a large though. this will look cute with leggings as it is long enough to cover your butt. i didn't know about the emerald color as it looked in store lights, but it is more blue-green at home. i like it even better. well worth $48!",5
"These are amazing quality. i agree, size up to not have such a sheer effect. i would not wear them as just leggings without a long shirt covering the butt.

they are warm. i wore them under some ski stuff. kept me warm.

i also washed them on handwash cycle. seemed to be ok.",5
These are the perfect high-waisted skinny jeans. they fit tts and don't stretch out. are the perfect length for cute falls or tucked into boots. i adore them!,5
"I love this top. of course i love most things that are denim, or look like denim. this is a fun twist on a denim shirt, the flutter sleeves and side panels make it different and eye catching. i have gotten so many compliments on it when i wear it! pairing this top with white or black pants or a skirt allows me to wear denim to work and still look professional.",5
"The dress is beautiful in pictures, but all the reviews are dead on...it was full of snags when it arrived! 8 snags to be exact. and the fabric was heavier than i expected. sadly, had to return.",1
"This vest looked so cute online but it's a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn't work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously, it's bad.",1
"A nice rayon peasant shirt - like the sleeve length. good for a fuller figure, covers all the bad sports and very comfortable.",5
"I like the look and fit of this shirt. can be dressed up or more casual. i got the purple motif, although i also like the brown and think that with all of the black in there (on the brown one) it would give a dressier look. i usually wear small from retailer, although this is my first blouse from this brand -- ended up getting an xs regular. i wanted the sleeves to fit at 3/4 as shown in the pics, but still be loose. i had a ton of extra room in the small, and the sleeves hit at wrist bone",5
This elegant tank made me feel as if i had been transported to downton abbey. the velvet trim and the lovely embellishments of sparkle have an art deco delight. the swing of the fabric was playful and flattering. it's easy to dress up and dress down. fantastic top!,5
"This shirt is soft, long and is the perfect pair for leggings. i am only 5 ft. tall so this is extra long on me in the front and back! i bought it in 3 colors and hope to get more. i bought a large and love how it covers/hides my trouble areas!",5
"I bought a few of these tops in the long sleeved version during the fall/winter, so i was super excited to see the short sleeved version come out! in this brand, i can wear an xs or s - i typically wear a s in retailer tops. if you need a tee that covers your lady parts when wearing leggings, this is it! it perfectly covers my rump and looks great. it's a nice weight, too. the detailing down the back is a nice touch.",5
"I ordered the medium, my usual size for flowing tops. it fits nicely, looks amazing from the front and looks slimming. then i turned to the side and oh my...my boobs protruded like two big balloons. i looked like wonder woman. there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it wasn't the size just the cut. i do have 34 g's but what the heck? the color is glorious but it has to go back.",5
"This tee is a great everyday staple.  it is comfortable and it also drapes very well.  i am 5ft 2in, 100lbs, 34b and i got this in xxs regular.  the length is perfect for leggings/skinny jeans, and it also looks really cute with a side knot in front. i have this is navy, green and black.  the navy color is brighter in person and in my opinion, looks better.  you can't go wrong. planning on getting the grey and pink one as well.",5
"Great tee! i usually wear an xs, but ended up getting this in xxsp. it is very long but the petite worked perfect on my 5'9"" frame.",5
"It is an expensive panty, but so worth the money! it is so unique and flattering!",5
I feel like a pessimist but then again nothings perfect. the only thing wrong with this stunning sweater is no button or snap so it just bags open. love it tho,5
"This sweater is beautiful! it fits/drapes nicely, is a gorgeous color, feels soft, and is comfortable to wear. i'm generally a s or m in this brand and opted for the medium. the sleeves are pretty long--i have to role them up a bit or they cover half my hand, but that's all right--they look fine rolled. i highly recommend!",5
Love this t-shirt. i rarely pay full price but love this and it's already out of stock. fits perfect. i tend to be short waisted so the length is perfect.,5
"I am an hourglass figure with a d cup. i rarely wear trapeze tops, as they make me appear larger. this is a very lovely top! fits nice (i was a medium) and hits nicely around hips (i'm 5'4). perfect for a special night out.",5
"The tee looks longer on the model. i am 5 feet 9 and this tee is showing of my belly which surprise me a bit. i thought it would hit the waist line. still, very nice tee, i love cotton, it simply is the best. colors are nice too.",5
Can't wait to wear this out for the holidays! very comfortable and versatile - looks great with the vegan leather moto pilcro pants or any black skinny jeans for a more dressed up look -- i was originally going to pair with dark gray pilcro but the black moto with black heels looked really great in the store dressing room. beading is gorgeous and well done. velvet trim makes it luxe in my opinion. love that you don't need to pile on anything else to look polished -- top speaks volumes in and of,5
"Nothing ""skinny"" about these pants. they're very cute. great quality. but they run a good one size large. size down!",5
I love the pattern and shape of this top. i can dress it up a bit with white pants and heels or dress it down with shorts and sandals. nice fabric and fit.,5
"These tights are amazing! if i care for them well, i know they will last me seasons upon seasons.",5
This dress was a gamble for a nautical them wedding next year. could not be happier. fabric was surprisingly stretchy which made it move like butter. the dress was stunning on and very comfortable which cannot be said for many gowns. i am so glad i took the gamble.,5
I'm obsessed with this top! i got it for christmas and wore it to dinner with black pants and flats and got lots of compliments. the fit is cute and fun and the detail is about even prettier in person.,5
"This is a cute dress, but not for me. 1. i think it runs very small, 2. it is super textured so if you don't want to add bulk (aka pounds) to your frame, this probably isn't for you. it's too bad it's online only because i would have benefitted from trying this on first. i'm sure it's probably adorable on smaller, thinner people. unfortunately, mine is going back.",1
"I'm really pleased with this jumpsuit. it has great detailing not visible in the online image and the fabric is so soft and comfortable. the navy is lovely. i'm normally a medium or size 4-6. i ordered the medium online and it was far too baggy, especially on top. i tried on the small and x small in store and the x small fit exactly how i wanted (as worn by the model) and the pants were still long enough. i'm glad i didn't give up on it.",5
"I needed an outfit for my son's christening 10 weeks after he was born. one thing i have to keep in mind with purchasing items now is how well they work for easy breastfeeding. this jumpsuit was perfect 'dressed up' with a cropped tuxedo jacket, cute shoes and jewelry. i felt so chic and not only did it fit my new post-baby shape, but was awesome for nursing him when needed. i felt comfortable all day and look forward to 'dressing it down' for less formal occasions. the material is so soft and i",5
"Size 8 always, 36c and i have broad shoulders...i found this true to size. the colors pop more and there is a cleavage alert, just letting you girls know. this is very figure flattering, especially with my body frame, it accentuates the right spots.",5
"I have long arms and they are not really small and the small fit me well. i think the fact that i have broad shoulders made this top work for me. definitely a keeper! i am surprised that the arms fit me though, because i often experience sleeves that are too tight when trying on tops. i'm glad that wasn't the case this time around. i'm 5'4"" 130-135lbs, depending on my appetite!",5
"Gorgeous dress and very flattering but it does run quite small in the bust (i'm 32 dd) and even the shoulder area (i rarely have problems there). i also find the side zipper a pain. sized up from a 2p to a 4p. the lace detail is especially beautiful and the color is more peachy than pink, the print quite saturated and not too pastel for early fall. i can see wearing it for 3 seasons, at least in ca.",5
The fabric of this vest is identical to a old white dish cloth! the cut of this vest is also bad! will be sent back!,1
"Very lovely print and fabric, there is more gray to the print's background than the photo shows. the shape is feminine and flattering, although the sleeves are more fitted on my arms. i bought this to wear to an early fall rehearsal dinner. very happy with the purchase!",5
"These socks feel amazing-i have them in both colors.

you would be surprised at the softness of these socks, yet they are slightly thicker than normal dress socks. i have weird toenails that tend to pierce through the tops of socks so a thicker sock is something that is very attractive to me. i feel like these would last a long time, with the bonus of making my feet feel like they are at the spa-these socks are soft?

these socks do not stay on my thigh so i have to use a garter and wear them li",5
The medium fits perfectly. it's not too long or too short. the feel of the fabric is soft and not heavy at all. i love the detail in the bird too. it bright and colorful. overall a great buy!,5
This dress was absolutely gorgeous and beautifully made. i ordered a size down as the other reviews stated the dress ran large. however it was massive. i wanted this dress so badly and mourn that i had to take it back to the store.,5
"Great fit, very soft fabric, and the sleeves are long enough!! great length in the body too.",5
"I saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream. i have worn it every chance i get. it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans. the length is perfect, the design is flattering, and the material is soft and comfortable. the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature, especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse. this will be a go to item. thanks retailer- another gem!",5
I am normally a straightforward 10 - since i saw the other review i ordered down to an 8 - i am still swimming in it.i would say i have about 4 inches of extra fabric in the waist/hips. this is sized way too large. i love the softness of the checkers but i suspect this could get itchy fast on the arms where it touches the wool - but i won't find out cause i'm returning it?on the bright side i might fit a 6 which would be pretty nice.,1
"This skirt looks just like it does on the model. it is the prefect maxi skirt with lots of movement. i actually bought the off the shoulder top it is paired with. you can't tell on the model but the slit has buttons up it so you can undo or do as many of the buttons as you want to show off as much leg as you want. it is a little pricey,but well worth it.",5
"Love these socks!!! i need to get more colors, they look so good on with boots with the lace showing!",5
"Love this!!! 115 lbs thin arms, the xs fits perfect. it's very flattering and has a boho vibe bc of its length. the arms are a little snug but in a very flattering way. haven't worn it enough yet to experience any pilling, but crossing my fingers. the cream is a really pretty pale oatmeal color imo. the grey is a black/grey speckled look.",5
"I ordered the cream colored duster after purchasing the grey one in store. i loved the grey one so much i had to get the other color. i love the length of the item. i am 5'9"" and don't feel like it is too short for me to get the look. it is light weight so i did not get too warm in it and will be able to wear it much of the year. i did wear it open as i feel that it runs a tad tight on the arms and torso when buttoned. however, i prefer the look of it worn open so that was not a problem for me.",5
"I wore this for the first time today and got so many compliments! i'm a personal stylist and went to an event for the company i work for..which means i was in a room filled with stylish people, and i got nothing but compliments about my top. it is so comfy and i did worry at first about the beading and if it was too fragile, but it was fine. i sized down for this top but can't wait to wear it all fall and winter!",5
"I love these pants! first, they are super flattering. for a new mom, the waist comes up high and tucks everything in without rolling over. second, they are versatile. you can pair them with pointed flats, boots or casual with sneakers. i am wearing mine with cream flats and the cream moth boucle colorblocked pullover sweater. also - normally i am an xl (especially for length!) but the large fit perfectly. i didn't want to say that they ran large, because they aren't too loose.",5
"It's like a coat for your legs, and lined with some silky fabric. the only flaw is a slight bulkiness where the fly hooks up.  i am a little sad that they don't have a petites, because i think this is proportioned for women 5'5"" and over, and i am only 5""3"". also not recommended for anyone with a tummy pooch. so tall women with somewhat flat abs - snap it up. it's a fabulous look for you.",5
"This is a great alternative to a vest. it does have some blue in it, as the other review mentions. i gave it less of a rating due to the potential for snags. i am keeping it though for the sale price!",5
I absolutely love this dress... tried it on one size down from my usual...it fit but my size would be perfect and 8 and 10 are out of stock. it's stunning and i love it... i badly have to have it... please bring it back retailer:),5
Great dress.  fitted but flowing.  i like the colors and think it will easily grams iron to fall.  i am 5 ft 32 d 27 waist.,5
"This is a gorgeous sweater with a great proportion in terms of length and fit. i am petite, so i worried that such a long sweater might look weird on me, but it actually makes me look slim and taller. i get so many compliments when i wear it. i ordered the xxs petite.",5
"This top is soft feeling and i appreciate that it's lined. it's light weight and feminine, but no camisole is needed. when you take it off the shoulder area feels tight, so you need to be a little gentle but it's gorgeous and you should get it. i'm a 32c and i got a 2.",5
"They ripped on the inside upper thighs of both legs less than two months after purchase. i've washed them once, and wear them a few times a week, so they're certainly not worn out. i've never had a pair give out even close to this early. i loved the cut of the jeans and the softness, and they hold their shape well after multiple wearings. the color is lighter than pictured. i paid full price (the most i've ever paid for jeans) because i'd heard good things about jean shop quality. even at sale p",1
"Tried this on in the red because the pattern is so eye catching and beautiful. i couldn't get it off fast enough. picture this: tight in the best, tight in the hips, extra billowy in the middle. so confused and can't see how this would be flattering on anyone. unless you're planning to repurpose the gorgeous fabric, skip.",1
I love all paige denim. i have the flared which i purchased in july and now the skinny. i got the zara ones last year which are a copy obviously and they are just not the same. the ones last year the paige sierra sold out fast but luckily these are here. i actually like these more because they are more worn looking. you can even wear a pretty top underneath to enhance them.,5
"I agree with the other reviewer that the green is brighter in person, which was a happy mishap. the 8p makes this look just like depicted on me in terms of proportion, so beware that this borders on too long for petites. my not small chest made me look pregnant, but it fit well regardless. adding a wide belt made this dress look amazing on me and shortens it to a more flattering length. this is a miracle as-is because i'm very short-waisted. keeper!",5
"This shirt is so comfortable! the fabric is amazingly soft and it is very well made. i liked the top so well that i bought one in grey and one in blue, and both in different sizes so that the smaller (xs) is a little closer fitting and the larger (s) is more blouse and casual. i had originally purchased both in m (which also looked fine, just larger and even more roomy), but exchanged for the smaller sizes. this is a wonderful casual weekend top to pair with skinny jeans, flats, leather boots, o",5
"Quality was not what you expect from retailer, especially for the price. top is lined but skirt is not. material is tissue paper thin and see thru. there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat, it keeps popping up. however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives. was returned.",1
"This has been my go to top for cooler days, so comfortable and soft. i would say it runs tts with a little bit of a lose fit. i am 5'10, 36c and usually wear s and the s fit me well. i could have gone down in size, but liked this to be a bit loser to wear over skinny jeans and leggings.",5
I'm usually a maeve fan. i found this top to look cheap and fit poorly. it is also very thin material and showed everything.,1
"This is one of my favorite new retailer buys. originally got the green for a family holiday party and went back for the sapphire. the cut and design are great. for reference i'm 5'3"", 115lbs and a 34a. the light weight fabric is perfect for so cal winter, but the real winning feature(s) is the detail. so, so cute. only complaint is it wrinkled fairly easily, but i'll deal with that for a cute form-fitting (but not too fitting!) top. .",5
"The cut of this piece is great, the quality of the fabric is terrible. i used it under another layer the first day i wore it and it pilled across the bust. after hand washing in cold water and hanging to dry it shrank in length- so much that i can no longer even wear it. i always happily pay a premium for quality staple wardrobe pieces. this didn't hold up to one wearing, let alone one season. i recommend strongly against it.",1
"These are very soft and fit well. at first i was a bit put off on the stone wash of the fabric; each pair is different. but it adds character and given the color and the soft fabric, it's a nice difference. i love the pockets, they are deep enough for anything you want to put into them. i love good deep pockets and my cell fits nice into my back pocket. take notice makers of woman's pants, there are some of us who *like* deep pockets!

only one negative... i have noticed hei-hei is not sewing",5
"This dress was built for my body to disguise it's flaws. i did have to size up because i am broad shouldered, busty, with a tummy pooch and no hips. this dress skims along all that mess and makes me look slimmer. received the package today and am wearing it right now, i'm so happy! i ordered size 10, my stats are 5'3"" 145# 36dd.",5
This dress comes with a built in fupa. literally there is extra material at the lower abdomen that sticks out and is very unflattering.,1
"I purchased this blouse in the kelly green the other day and i love it. the color is beautiful and i like how it hangs/flows- especially the sleeves. it's not warm enough to wear by itself when it's really cold but would be beautiful layered with a cardigan in the winter months and by its own when it's warmer. looks great with skinny jeans, flares and just about anything including the right skirt. i'm so happy i purchased this!!",5
"I really like this top. bought it in ""purple"" but i would not call it that. it is more maroon or burgundy. color is exactly what it shows in the online photo. really like the green also. crocheted arms are super. i found it ran slightly small, so if you are between sizes, order up. one slight personal problem for me is that there is cashmere in it and i live in florida. even though we do get cooler weather here, i am not sure i will have that much chance to wear it; it will be too warm for me. t",5
Do not buy! i used my 15% discount on this. what a waste. my usual sizes range from s to l depending on what brand. i should have gotten a small. i don't think that would've helped. it was so awkward looking. nothing like the model. it made me look as if i had gained 15 pounds. it was waaay longer in the back-like a mullet. the material was really thick. it is more appropriate for fall. i had high hopes for this-to dress up or down. it was just so ridiculous.,1
"I absolutely love this sweater, very comfortable and flattering!!! i'm thinking of buying it in another color!!!",5
I love this top it is easy to wear fun and very comfortable. i was thinking about it for weeks and kept coming back to it after i read a review about going up a size i decided to go for it and i am very happy i did!!! my new favorite!!!,5
"I got the orange dress and find it super comfortable and flattering. i dress it up with a one-inch taupe belt and taupe wedge shoes. it moves beautifully, i can wear a regular bra and it doesn't show. i got an xs regular and the hemline hits 6"" above my ankles. i'm 5' 3"", 33-26-35 and normally take a size 2 or 0. i'm long waisted, so often a petite will be short-waisted on me. the seam actually comes just below the bust line on me, unlike on the model. on days when i'm a bit bloated, i can wear",5
"I am petite and curvy and was apprehensive about the cropped length of this jumpsuit. however, the petite looks great and the length is perfect. it is light enough weight to keep you cool during the day but provides some coverage for cool evenings. i ordered the xs petite and it was still a little loose. i am 5'3"" and 125lbs. this will be my go to for fall! looks great styled with ankle boots or clogs and will carry me into fall with a chunky sweater!",5
"I promised myself only one pair of joggers this year, and these were the ones i went with (in the blue motif). for me the tipping point was the quality and fit of these were far superior than the others i tried, while still being machine washable. the fabric has aa little substance, yet is still lightweight and comfortable. the fit has a perfect bit of tailoring/tapering to be ultra-flattering while having the comfort of pajama pants. the blue motif is adorable too - love the geometric shapes. l",5
I can't believe i waited so long to get this. it is truly soft and well fitted. the deails in the sleeves and neck are just great. kuddos again angel of the north!,5
I bought these in both colors. i'm usually an xs or a small and i went with the small for the length. they are a comfy shirt great for the hot summer days.,5
"I saw the photo of the young woman wearing this dress in the reviews and she looked beautiful, i on the other hand looked awful. the fabric of the entire dress is quite stiff, so the dress didn't move with me; it sort of felt as if i was wearing a paper cut out. then to contribute to the volume, the sleeve is not set in, it is a raglan style, that on me looked more like a bat suit, than what i was hoping for, a beautiful distinctive dress for an important affair. also the belt didn't enhance the",1
"This dress is so cute and comfortable! it can be dressed up or down, super versatile. love it!",5
"Love this top! has a beautiful shape, and it wasn't too long on my 5'3"" frame. puella always makes items with lovely, soft cotton, and this is no exception! awesome piece for summer!",5
"I ordered this tank, and was very pleased with the quality. each of the stripe colors has a different knit, adding an unusual and interesting look. it has a trim fit. i wear s and sometimes xs, but this fit perfectly in the s. i agree with the other reviewers that that armholes are the correct size- so nice not to worry about a bra showing in the armholes!",5
"Love! adds texture and femininity to a basic sweater. ordered a small so i could layer. if you're busty or between a s and m, you may want to size up.",5
"I love this jumpsuit! i'm 5'3, 122 lbs and the x-s was to big on me. i had to return and order the x-s in petite and the fit was perfect. you can wear it with heels or with slides. i wore it with a thick brown wide belt and some tan open toe shoes. i wore gold earrings and necklace. i got some many compliments and my girl friends asked where i had purchased it. and if. purse i told them retailer;)",5
"I think this is adorable and am so excited to have bought it. it is really flattering. i love how it hangs-- it's loose enough without being unflattering at all. it's a little retro. it feels really soft! i hope it holds up well. 
i'm 5'1 and and 103. i got an xs and it fits perfectly.",5
Lovely dress!  i&amp;amp;#39;m wearing it with a blue denim jacket and brown suede boots.  it is most certainly purple - a little more so than the picture.  still love it.,5
Beautiful white denim pants. the fit is perfect. fitted on the top with a nice flare on the bottom. very classy and versatile cut. paige denim runs long for me and these are no exception. will be getting them hemmed but i don't mind because they are perfect!,5
I had eyed this simple yet stylish dress for awhile but hadn't tried it on yet. i managed to snag the orange version during the tag sale - $40 for maeve?? it is super flattering and will be a wardrobe staple for years.,5
"Purchased these in the blue motif. love the hei hei brand. . they run true to size. they are very comfortable and wear well. you can wear them to the office,dress them up or go casual with a tee. versatility and comfort, what more could you ask for.",5
"Purchased these in the blue motif. love the hei hei silky pull on pants. i got hooked on them last summer and was thrilled to see them for the upcoming spring. they run true to size. they are beyond comfortable and wear well. everyone should have at least one pair of these comfy pants in their closet. dress them up, down or wear them to the office. versatility and comfort, what more could you ask for.",5
I love this sweatshirt! i truly did not pay much attention to it on line but while in my local store one was returned and it caught my eye immediately as the flowers are embroidered in a nice substantial rope type yarn to give it a more demential effect. the torn holes here and there give the appearance of being the most loved garment in your closet...and it has become mine along with the jacket with the same embroidery...funny how 2 pieces i did not give a second thought about have become my li,5
"I was immediately drawn to the ochre yellow color of this dress and it's stitch and pleat details and was happy to score it early enough in the season still in my size and preferred color option. unlike other reviewers, i was not turned off by the ribbing at the neck and arm lines. i received the dress yesterday, am wearing it today, and have already received compliments from even the most sour-faced co-workers who can't give a compliment or share casual conversation in the hallway. the sunny ye",5
"Really like the cut - it's tough for petites to find good joggers and these hit the mark. light, easy, comfy - great with heels for work or sandals on the weekend.",5
Absolutely love this sweater! it is a tad bit large. i bought it in a medium but because i like the loose fit i will keep it. it is very light and great for the summer. i've only worn it once so far and received many compliments on it. great quality as well!,5
"I love these! i adore tracy reese, and these are my favorites. they feel like pjs, fit true to size and are just perfect for work (i'm a teacher) or for going casual. very lightweight and not too hot for texas summers.",5
"These were not tts, imo. i am a 10 and ordered the m. they did not look bad, but b/c these have no stretch, they were not comfy, like joggers are supposed to be. i ordered the lg when they went on sale and while they are baggy, the comfort is spot on in the larger size. i got the navy after seeing the irl pics. happy with this sale purchase !",5
"I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on, it is so big on the bottom, it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad.",1
These truly are tights and not leggings. they could not be worn alone but definitely great under skirts or dresses. they are thick and warm. i thought they ran a little big.,5
I love this top! it fits perfect and is of great quality! i ordered the pink and love it so much i'm getting the navy one! colors are so trendy as well. this top is so much cuter in person. hard to tell the detail online. definitely recommend to others!,5
"I saw this dress in a store the other day. it is so cute in real life. i don't think the pictures online even begin to show how cute it is on. the dress is well-made and it fit perfectly. in fact, it is quite flattering. i am so happy i saw it in the store. even though i am big online shopper i would have passed on this dress if i only saw it online, but don't because it is worth every penny.",5
"I had been on a white jeans hunt for some time. pilcro is one of my favorite brands, and i can buy online with confidence knowing they will fit. if petite had been available, that would have been better in length, but it was not so i had them hemmed.",5
"The good: the sloths are cute because sloths are always cute. 

now the bad: the material is wretched. it feels damp even when it's not... it's see through and unlined... it's scratchy and wrinkly... and though the cut of the dress would be fine, the fabric is so limp that the high-low hem looks more like a tail. 

i wanted to like this, but charging nearly 200 dollars for a see through piece of awful fabric with a passable cut was simple not acceptable. i returned it as fast as i possibly c",1
"I have been stalking these pants since they first showed up on retailer's site. i have never even tried on anything like this before though, so have been waiting patiently for a review to get an idea of what they might look like, fit like...etc sale plus 30% off was incentive to take the plunge without a review though. i am wearing them right now and they are so comfortable and pretty and just...everything summer. perfect!!!! i am not a ""shorts"" person, generally wear skirts and dresses. these are",5
"I cannot speak more highly of these jeans! i am a standard size 2, 5'3"" and have never been able to purchase a pair of jeans and wear them right away. i *always* have to hem them by massive amounts. these jeans are so flattering, the wash is amazing. i have worn them with cute ballet flats and tall boots so far, but i think the possibilities are endless. i am petite but in a curvy way and i haven't felt these great in a pair of jeans in so long. the wash is great for dress up/dress down. i have",5
Seen it online so i ordered it is so cute great fit patchwork is so pretty very vintage looking runs large would be cute with some skinny jeans and some booties,5
"This dress is much cuter in person than it looks on the model online. it's so flattering, it fits like a dream, and i love the fabric. i love that the skirt is a true a-line, not poofy, so it's sleek, slimming and flattering. the neckline is feminine and gorgeous and is a bit sexy, while still being classy. oh, and the length, perfection! not too long, not too short. i never ever pay full price and for this dress i had to. i am a curvy size 4 and it fits perfectly true to size. i couldn't be hap",5
Saw this in the store but didn't have my size. ordered online- wore it twice already and got so many compliments! very current and flattering!,5
I got the blue and love the color. it's bigger than it looks here! almost like the model has it pinned in the back...but it's swingy and super cute and fun!!,5
I loved this dress when i tried it on. the plaid is darling and the plunge is sexy. i so wish it would work for my body type. the waist came a bit too high on me (almost a line) and it made me look kind of frumpy in the midline.,5
"This elegant-with-a-slight-edge top has a lovely neckline and is very comfortable. i chose the denim/blue version, which i wouldn't wear with jeans, but it's great with crops. i imagine it will be a good layering piece in the fall. it's long, but not long enough to be a dress. overall, it's flattering and slightly structured up top with tiny buttons at the back of the neck?generous and full below.",5
The stylist at my local retailer recommended i try this dress and it did not disappoint!  the material is fabulous and it looks exactly as pictured on the model.  it also has pockets which is a bonus to me.  i normally wear a 4 but bought a 6 in this dress - i am a 34c and i felt the 4 was a little tight across the chest - otherwise i feel the dress is pretty much true to size.,5
These are more than what i had expected! they're beautiful and fit like a glove. i'm thrilled that i purchased them.,5
Wide fit. usually an 8-10 at retailer. got a large for online order and was large for sure - great for summer or winter with long sleeve and tights,5
"The color is great, a nice alternative to all my black tights. good quality.",5
"I bought this in blue and have worn it with jeans, khaki shorts, and camo pedal pushers. added just a perfect amount of feminine detail without being over the top. i'm loving that it shows off my shoulders (they're tan from my vacation and i've been working like a fiend on my arms in the gym). it's well made too!",5
I live abroad where there is no retailer. so i  rely heavily on reviews.i took the advice from others and ordered a size up.  glad i did because the top portion of the dress runs very small. if you have larger breasts this dress may not work for you. luckily for me..it fits wonderfully..i love the fabric and the fact that it has pockets. it's lined..but not too bulky.its a lovely summer halter where you can show a little skin.,5
"This is really a gorgeous blouse. the design is very feminine and elegant, and fits true to size. i didn't think it ran short and the material is light and airy. it sold out so quickly so i had to wait awhile and managed to get my hands on a 4 when it was available for a quick second. it was def. worth the wait. a gorgeous top.",5
"This dress has been in my inbox for a long time and when it went on sale i purchased it right away. i am a size 4 petite in everything retailer and have not had a problem with fit, if anything i might have to size down. i purchased a 4 petite in this dress and i couldn't zip it all the way up. it was as if i was trying to get into a 0 petite.  i don't even think a size 6 would fit. there is something not right with the make of this particular dress i received. even if the fit was perfect i didn't",1
"I needed a summer party dress for a few casual special occasions this summer and this dress fit the bill perfectly. fits tts (5'8"", 160lb - sz 8) and is really flattering. it is quite open in the front but i was able to keep everything situated w/ the right bra. purchased it on sale and am so pleased!",5
These white jeans are super cute. the longer length is perfect for tall ladies who can still roll them up. you can also adjust the height of the cuff since it is not pre-attached to the jeans. i will wear them all the time.,5
"I get compliments on this top every single time i wear it. the pattern is so pretty, and while it's very lightweight, it still drapes nicely. i would caution that someone with a larger chest may find that the shape is not quite right - i am a 34d and just on the cusp of having it be too balloon-y on top.",5
The color is great. the fit is accurate and it is a great transitional piece.,5
This top is perfect!! i am small chested and it actually makes me look like i have a chest! plus for me!! it's also great for work and casual.,5
"Cutest dress i own. very flattering, makes your waist look tiny.",5
"Love the luxury feel, so soft. perfect for day out. i'm 5'6 and the fit is just right. not too long or short. dalls right at the shoulders too.",5
"This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like i'm not wearing a bra at all, except i have the gentle support i need. the material is very thin and the pink color is see through, so not recommended under a white or see through shirt. perfect for sleeping or lounging in!",5
"So, i really like the plaid designs by siyu. i saw these pants and questioned whether they would be tight and scratchy and ill fitting, but they were so cute, i had to find out. i'm really glad i did. the wool is soft and actually a little stretchy. it has an elastic waist, which is a plus, because sometimes, even if the legs fit, the waist is too small, or vice versa. i am a large, and very curvy on the bottom, and these are perfect and flattering, and the elastic waist is just right. as on the",5
These pants are so fun! i use them to sleep in as they are see through. i had to size up as the waist band gave me muffin top. i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large.,5
"I loved this dress immediately. it is soft to the touch and super comfortable. i will be wearing this so much this summer! the arms are true to size and the body is flowy and roomy, but it is still flattering! highly recommend!",5
"This top is truly adorable. it runs a little shorter so better with higher waisted pants. the bow is nice. it did come with the folded pleats showing. we'll see if they come out when i iron? i ordered 0 and am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs. the top is structured and zips all the way in the back.",5
"These are very fun and breezy pants. i first ordered a medium, but the waist was too low. i exchanged for a large and i love the fit now. i like them loose and airy. for reference i am usually a 10-12 petite and the l regular is super cute ;0) i hope they wash well. they are perfect for the hot and humid northern va summer.",5
Love the material and how the back is longer than the front! adds style!,5
Great purchase. true to size. so flattering. love it simplicity.. buy it if you enjoy compliments!,5
"I agree with another reviewer who said to get these while you can. the fish print is adorable! and you can't beat the style and uniqueness for this price. i am 5'6"", 145 lbs with long legs and a thicker waist. normally wear size 8 in pants and purchased these in size small. i would definitely recommend sizing down. the mediums fit me ok but the small was more flattering overall while still being roomy and having lots of flow. can't wait to wear these!!",5
"Love this product; got them in the coral and they are comfortable, easy, flattering & versatile.
dressed up or down, they always look good, they hang beautifully, and their ease & comfort make them my go to staple in this southern heat!",5
"I admit i have a soft spot for a most anything from maeve. this dress is no exception. i had overlooked it online due to the white shirt they show with it online. but the material, design tex are great. the colors are very me and i can see this being a great fall, winter and early spring dress. the material is very soft ( i have sensitive skin) and i love the little pop of color that the front piece adds. the only draw back for me is the lack of pockets and it runs big. i got this on sale so siz",5
"Great style and cut, love the deep v. the fabric is soft and its very comfortable. it gives some support. i don't wear it with light blouses or shirts, unless i'm hanging around the house. i have this is pink and black.",5
This dress is perfection and i bought the blue one. please make this in black or other dark colors.,5
"This sweater is beautiful!
the lace is gorgeous and the sweater is soft and cozy.....rare to find a top that is stunning and comfortable at the same time!
the lace is very high quality, and enhances the sweater in a very sophisticated way.....adding that little something special.
the color keeps the overall look elegant and appropriate for any age.
runs true to size.",5
"So comfortable! i wore it during my last airline travel day, and a complete stranger complimented me on it.",5
"This shirt dress will make a great piece for the summer to throw on. the length is perfect for either a dress or throw on some tights as a shirt. i bought the beige color one and it's a little see through. would def need to wear a slip on.

i am 5'8 120 pounds and the xs fit perfectly.",5
"I saw this dress in the retailer store and fell in love with it. tried it on, and even though i was wearing jeans and desert boots, the dress looked terrific! it's great, can obviously be dressed up or down, a wonderful addition to my wardrobe! thanks retailer!",5
"I bought this in a medium at the store (usually a size 8 -10) and bought one for my daughter who was with me ,in the coral color. (she's 7 months pregnant , and bought her a small. it fits fine below the belly. she loves how comfy it is.) my other daughter saw them and i had to buy her a pair as well. :>) so, we were hanging out at the hotel on a girls weekend and wore them at the pool and even to sleep in. i think you can actually dress it up and wear it out and about as well. i did see that a",5
"I ordered these in the pinkish color, and i love them! i'm 5'8"" 140 lbs. and the size small fits perfectly. they are definitely sheer, but they're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected. these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini, bandeau, or even tankini. the price is great, especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms. no pockets is the only negative.",5
"I get more compliments on the stress. it is perfect for work, perfect for summer night concert, perfect date night. love this dress!",5
"I tried this on in the store, but almost didn't because i thought it would look like a sack. the dress looks so good. it fits nicely in the shoulders which gives structure and then the rest of the dress is roomy, but no so much it looks stupid. im 5'5"" and it hit above my knees by an inch or two.",5
"These are adorable pants!!! i ordered them in both colors because i couldn't decide which was cuter. they are light and airy, but not see through. they will be perfect to use as a swim coverup, pajamas, dress them up, anything. very comfortable and versatile! i am a size 8 and ordered a medium and they fit perfect. the elastic doesn't pinch, but probably would have if i would have went with a small.",5
"Super soft, light fabric. this dress is perfect for work or the weekends. this brand is new to me but i'll definitely be checking out their stuff more in the future.",5
"The fabric wrinkles so easily and any slight moisture or liquid immediately turns into a dark spot on the blue grey...condensation drips from a glass, gel deodorant, etc. i tried the cream but it's very sheer. i had to return this dress-- not practical!",1
"Love the soft fabric and easy fit of this dress. i'm pleased that it does give a hint of one's figure and doesn't just hang like a sack. i found the blue to be most flattering and was playing with styling at home and found that the wider retailer ""tabby"" leather belt gave it a whole new look.",5
"So cute, great for over a swim suit or walking around town. got these on sale. xxs fit perfectly! fabric is very soft, pom poms add fun styling.",5
"I went into the store to buy this in white after seeing it on the website. i ended up with the blue/gray color. the white was completely see thru. could have worked as a swim cover- but not at this price for me. the blue on the other hand is fine. the fabric is soft and hangs nicely. you can definitely dress it up with some booties and a belt, or keep it laid back with flip flops. i'm sure i'll wear this a bunch this summer. the color is versatile enough that i will pair with leggings and boots",5
"I looooove these. the styling makes me wonder if i could even wear them to work on casual fridays with the right top they are so great. i am a little concerned about how they will hold up over time since some of the stitching looks a little shoddy, but they are still worth it at this price. i am going to order another pair just in case they don't hold up, i love them that much.",5
This product is the best if not the most excellent garment i have purchased in years i feel like a model even though i am full body lady what gorgeous piece of clothing,5
These are very comfy and can be worn casual or dressed up. love the pom poms.,5
I thought it would be heavier than it is. it's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater (it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer). it's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too.,1
"These are not only comfortable, but so cute. they are something you don't see on everyone else, and people always comment. i get so many compliments or inquiries every time i have them on. the materiel is lightweight and flowing. i love these casual, beautiful beach pants. i got a small, my usual size and they fit great. 5'3'"", 130 lb.s. i wear tee shirts, bathing tops, coobies, any kind of top looks swell. get them while you can. i got the peach and black color.",5
I just got this dress in the beige color and i absolutely love it. the fit is perfect and i feel that it is just the right length. i got a small and i am 5'9''. the pockets are a great touch and really are the key for tunic style dresses for me. i love the soft material and could live in this dress. such a great staple for my closet!,5
I buy everything that retailer sells in chambray. this top did not disappoint. it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing. the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying. i am not big busted so i didn't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have.,5
This is a very flattering top and the details are spectacular. it is very comfortable to wear and the the appliquã©s and embroidery make this very slimming. as the other reviews noted the side slits go up quite high. i won't be raising my arms much wearing this. the small rhinestones in the center of the black flowers go around the entire sleeve and they catch on the rest of the shirt sometimes. i have to be aware of it and more careful not to make very fast movements until i'm sure i'm not tangl,5
This was an impulse purchase for me. a year ago i would have never considered a jumpsuit but they are growing on me. i had yet to find one that fit without too much need for tailoring. this one did the trick! i like that the cut is in such a way that you can wear a normal bra underneath it without it showing. the fabric itself is very lightweight so i would recommend a bra for some support. i like that the fabric is incredibly lightweight so you can wear it on a hot summer day. the jumpsuit is l,5
This is not your basic white tee. the ruffle and seam down the front add visual interest. cute alone or paired with a sweater and statement necklace.,5
I got this vest on sale in the navy color and love it! the quality of the fabric is great and the draped design of it is so chic! really adds a stylish touch to almost any outfit.,5
"This vest is much silkier than the pictures online show, which was a great surprise. the cut of this vest is beautiful and it can be worn so many ways!",5
"This shirt is amazing! the soft fabric, detailed embroidery, and gorgeous little beads/sequins..all fabulous quality and make this piece worth the price. i love the length and cut of this too - not boxy, yet not too tight or fitted; just covers my bum. can be dressed up or down.",5
This vest is awesome. it can take any dress/outfit and instantly make it more fancy and formal. the way it drapes is very forgiving and the back bow can be modified and switched out for different colors depending on outfit color. .,5
"I hope you can get this top.this is a great classic,that will be in my closet for a long time.",5
"This top is beautifully detailed , it is flattering and i am very happy with my purchase!",5
"I picked this up at my nearest retailer this afternoon after placing my order a few days ago. i purchased the off-white version in size small. i actually tried this on in the dressing room to make sure i was satisfied with the product. when i came out, i asked the retailer customer service rep if she could cut the tag off so that i could wear it out today. she not only helped me out but also commented on how much she liked this sweater while also wondering why she hasn't seen it in store; i informed",5
I found this jumpsuit at my local retailer it must have been a web order return i love it the fit is true size the colors are perfect it's very comfortable and gorgeous on and at the sale price i could not pass it up,5
"I'm a big fan of left of center as a brand, and this top is definitely a winner!  the deep green is gorgeous and looks fantastic with denim. the shirt is true to size and is flatteringly loose without looking too tent-like. highly recommend!",5
"This dress is gorgeous! i absolutely love the embroidery. a note about the sizing- while the top portion fits snugly, the hip section runs slightly big. i was surprised to find that the 4 i ordered looked baggy, so i went into the store to try a 2, but the 0 was the best fit! however i'm small-chested (and 5'6"" 113lbs), so i was able to go with the 0 as it fit the hips much better. if you're a bustier type though, the top may be tight. other than the tricky sizing, it's perfect.",5
"Makes me feel like a sexy ice skater. true to size, i am 5'0 and 120 lb and both the small and medium fit. i kept the medium. love it!",5
"This top is so beautiful! looks even better in person. i was hesitant because of the price, but i am so happy i bit the bullet and ordered. i am a 36c and the bust is slightly snug.",5
Bought this dress for an indian wedding- it was perfect!,5
"This top is beauitiful. gorgeous detailing with the eyelet lace, black flower appliquã©s, silver beads and tiny rose gold sequins down the front. true to size. i'm 5'2"", 130 lbs, 34b and took my usual size 4. the slits do come up a bit far on the sides like another reviewer noted but not really enough to be a problem. i didn't find it necessary to get the petite size in this top. i was going to wait until further markdown since the top is still pricey even with a 20% discount but couldn't resist",5
"Like other reviewers, when i saw this top in person i was struck by it. i would never have even looked twice at it online. i hardly ever buy things at full price from retailer but i treated myself to this one. the only thing i'd disagree with is that it runs true to size. at my store, there was only 1 left (in a size 10). i'm usually a 4/6 but i figured i'd try it on since the style is loose anyway. and the 10 fit very nicely. i did try a 6 in another store and found the slits came too high and th",5
"The top is just as shown in the picture and it is tts. lots of detailing with beads and lace. i'm 5'1, 92lbs and purchased a petite 00. just as the other reviewers noted, the side slits do come high. high waisted jeans or leggings works perfectly.",5
"Absolutely gorgeous top! i have purchased so many retailer tops and this is the 1st review i have ever written. this top is just that deserving for a review. stunning in so many ways. i am 5' 2"", 118 lbs and purchased a size 4. fits perfectly. maybe runs a tad small. can not wait to wear!",5
"I have looked at this dress a dozen times online and passed. after reading other reviews felt compelled to see why everyone is in love with this dress. when i opened the box i was blown away. this dress is so beautiful and the crystals, which look like sequence online are high quality, as is the fabric and craftsmanship.
a perfect 10!!!!!!!!!!!!
you must have this dress in your closet!!!!!!!
ordered my usual size and fits perfect.",5
This sweater is very pretty. i had my concerns being that i don't normally pay $300.00 for a sweater but i found the material to be extremely high quality and the details really make it a beautiful piece. i literally got a little tired of people telling me all day how pretty it was. this is definitely a piece of clothing i will cherish for years to come.,5
"I saw this vest the week it came in the store. i was hesitant, thinking, ""what do i have to go with this?"" i left the store and had to go back and purchase it. i'm so happy i did! it really does go well simple tops (dressy or casual). it is also perfect for the ""winter white"" trend happening this year!",5
This skirt is amazing! it has the right amount of sparkle and the right amount of shape. i bought this in a size six which i can really switch between 6 and 8 depending but the six fits perfectly. i also bought the regular length even though i could probably be considered petite but it ended up being perfect. but the skirt is so lovely in person and has just enough wow that you can wear this thing with a simple tee and still look amazing. i wore this to a party with a black high neck tank and re,5
"Pictures do not do justice to this beautiful piece of art. the embroidery and jewel detail is exquisite. just don't plan on holding any kids or pets, you won't want to snag it or them.",5
"I had been to the retailer store several times in hopes in finding the perfect top for my upcoming reunion. as soon as i saw this, i knew it was perfect for the occasion. i'm sure i'll get a lot of use out of this top as you can dress it up or down.",5
The details and colors are exquisite. stop hesitating and get this dress,5
"I saw this top online, but i didn't fall in love with it until i tried it on in the store. the retailer salesperson told me that she owned this top and that she always received many compliments when wearing it, but she also warned me that the rhinestones on the sleeves were a problem as they kept getting snagged in the fabric on the body. i decided to purchase the top in the end because it is so beautiful and one of a kind, but i ended up removing all of the rhinestones on the sleeves and i haven'",5
"Comfortable, flattering, one step up in formality from jammies, what more could you want?",5
"My daughter tried on this shirt in new york & loved it so i ordered it for her for christmas1 i am thrilled, & she will be thrilled! love my purchase!",5
Very intricate detail with stitching. love the contrast of black on cream. has slits on each side. bought it for holiday parties! just what i had hoped it would be.,5
"Such a gorgeous top, the detail and fit are amazing. however, after wearing the top for about 8 hours, 7 of the center rinestones fell off. the beads on the sleeves also snagged the embroidery where the sleeve touches the body. but, i love the top so much, i exchanged it for another and hoping i have better luck with quality this time around.",5
"Absolutely adore this dress and plan onwearing it to a wedding. it is so well made and luxurious, i feel amazing in it! even more gorgeous in person",5
"Beautiful piece that i loved from the day i received it in the mail. lots of compliments, just a fun, pretty outfit.",5
"The details on this top are absolutely gorgeous, from the lace, to the sequins, to the rhinestones! that said, the details are not overpowering, yet more subtle. can't wait to wear this over the holiday season. sure to get tons of compliments!!",5
"I think of tracy reese as running small, and usually size up, but the 8 was the only size left so i grabbed it and it fits perfectly. i got a million compliments on it and got rid of my other jumpsuits because this one is perfection. please note that if you are busty it will show cleavage, so you need the right bra.",5
"I love this t-shirt - the moss green color is just what i wanted, cute fit and true to size. purchased the medium b/c i like t-shirts to be a little loose.",5
"I was quite surprised to find the background color of this dress was grey,not the stone/linen that i was expecting. it still works beautifully against the citrus. fits true to size; the 3/4 sleeves are slightly narrow around the forearm but not tight. i'm 5'4, fairly slim, 132 and i'm in the process of exchanging the petite m for a regular medium as it was just a bit too short for me. i'm very short waisted/long legs, so the straight design is perfect for eliminating the issue. i also found no p",5
This shirt is gorgeous. i bought it for my engagement party and got lots of compliments. the only thing negative was that the particular shirt i bought had one of the stones on the sleeve that the prongs were bent so it snagged the beautiful embroidery on the front of the shirt.. of course my local retailer exchanged it for a perfect new one without hassle. it's an expensive shirt but perfect for a special occasion.,5
"Saw this in the store, looked at the price tag and decided to wait for a sale. got it this weekend with the 20% off and love it! (thanks retailer) wore it for my birthday dinner and received a ton of compliments. as someone else noted, it does catch on itself so take care when wearing. also, the slits on the side are semi-high but as my husband noted, this makes it a touch sexy instead of just a tunic. i went with an 8 for this reason(you could also wear a tank underneath). and yes, even on sale,",5
I was so excited to receive this in the mail. it fits true to size and is extremely flattering. so glad that i made this purchase,5
"Weather changes during a day to extremes in nela. lightweight cardigan for when little is needed that's pretty and practical, if you take a close look at photo you will see the weave is open, so could snag. nothing hidden. it is what it is-pretty, lacy, feminine.",5
"I give this sweater a five star review. i am always thrilled to be able to add a cardigan or caccoon sweater that is a color that is different than black or white.this pairs beautifully with so many of the shells and sleeveless shirts that i have from retailer.yes this sweater is extremely delicate, it didn't pull at all while i was trying it on. this will be a great transition sweater.",5
"I received this top by mail yesterday and opened it this morning. all i can say is wow. it's gorgeous. the detailing is stunning, classic retailer amazing. a true standout piece. can't wait to wear.",5
A must have sweater with great details. it can be a star piece with leather tights or very long flare jeans. i recommend platform booties for perfect body proportion.,5
"I was able to get this on sale. when it arrived, it was missing half of the rhinestones. i am very surprised that this top would be sent out this way. it also was missing the little bag with extra stones. i'm reaching out and wondering if anyone else has experienced this and is there a store that sells rhinestones like the one on the blouse? any help from anyone would be appreciated. i hate to part with this, but where was quality control?",1
I love this blouse! the details are beautiful and and it is so versatile! i can where it with jeans and boots or slim black pants and strappy sandals and get tons of compliments every time. one of my favorite retailer purchases ever!,5
"This product is awesome! i'm a tall lady with wide calves and thighs and these socks look and feel fantastic on me; they are tight enough that they don't wind up sliding down around my ankles, but not so snug that they make my legs look like sausages. i would recommend this product to all of my girlfriends.",5
"I was considering this online for days before a ladies lunch date meandered into a brick & mortar location. i had been thinking of sizing up, if i ordered online, just to be sure it wouldn't be too tight or awkward, and when i had looked for it in stores nearby, it was out of stock, but i hadn't thought to look for my tts, which happened to be available in the store where i went. i tried it on, because i was so curious, and it worked!! i love it. it is so easy-breezy. it will be perfect to layer",5
"This jacket is totally adorable. i wore it with a man tailored shirt with the color up and the sleeves poking out.
it has a great swing to it and is very comfortable! it is sized perfectly. and i got it on sale!!!",5
"I just purchased this cardigan, it is better in person than the picture. the fit is fabulous, it is very versatile. it can be worn with many different options, definitively be wearing often.",5
"Great sweater. looks and fits as shown. if you're between sizes, size down as the shoulders are relatively broad.",5
This skirt is stunning. the red is so vibrant. this will be a staple in my wardrobe for years to come. it can be dressed up or down. love it!,5
"Much nicer in person -- the chunky knit reads more gray with black accents than ""blue"" as described here. there are lovely flecks of rust, blue, goldenrod, green throughout. super soft, stretchy; it's fine sizing down...otherwise the arm holes dip down very low. i'm usually a size 4/small and xs was best for me (33"" bust, long torso, broad shoulders). i can see wearing another layer underneath when cold weather sets in.",5
"I bought this in the olive green and blue a while ago, both in the small. great jumpsuit and true to size. i accidentally washed the blue one in the washing machine (in cold) but caught it before the dryer. it still fits, although it seems a bit shorter in the legs.",5
"I ordered this top in a size 'm' as i heard mara hoffman runs small. the size chart on her site would have me order a size 's' as i have a 33"" bust (33-25-~37). however, my bra size is a 30d or 32c and the size m is what fit. therefore a m might also fit a 34b and a 36a as the back is adjustable. it even stays up without the halter which is highly unusual for me.

the only negative that really disappointed me is that the patterns are not quite symmetrical as i expect from this brand and from t",5
"This is adorable and unique. i've tried shawls and ponchos before, they usually swallow me up, this sweater has that type of feel but isn't so much fabric. goes with everything.",5
"Love these shorts! not too tight and not too short! they match so many tops! tts for my hard to fit figure! great for weekends, vacations, and just to be adorable in!",5
"This is such a great top - it can be easily dressed up or down. i love my tops flowy, and this is just that! i have a larger chest (34d) and the flowy nature of it keeps it from being too short up front. even though it has eyelits in it, it can be worn without a cami underneath as long as you wear a good nude bra. it'll be a great sweater for all seasons. i'm even able to wear it to work. highly highly recommend.",5
"I wore this sweater last weekend and received so many compliments. not only is this a very pretty style, the poncho is comfortable. i really glad i purchased.",5
"This is the cutest poncho style sweater (but the arms aren't attached like a true poncho. it doesn't work for a petite customer, unfortunately, but on average sized it's gorgeous. so pretty.",5
"Adorable! great for yoga or everyday use. can even fit a strapless bra under with no showing(i purchased the black). i'm 5'4"", usually a 6-8 and it fit great.",5
I absolutely love this sweater. it will take me into spring and right on in to summer beach bonfire nights. a great staple!,5
"The look, quality, and feel of this jacket is perfect. it does run a large so i would order a size down. i definitely worth every penny.",5
"Beautiful, detailed sweater. when i tried it on, i felt it made me look a tad bit boxy, but once i pushed the sleeves up about six inches, i loved the way it looked! i'm wearing it tomorrow and know i will get lots of compliments!",5
"I was able to grab two of these in grey and navy during one of their awesome sales. it doesn't look like much on the hanger, but it's lovely on the body.
____________
pros:
- lots of stretch.
- comfortable and roomy without looking frumpy.
- lovely color and texture.
- can size up or down depending on how you want it to look.
- minimizes bust size nicely.
____________
cons:
- if you have curves like me, it won't be as roomy as the model, unless you size up. i actually bought a size down and it b",5
"This is such a cute sweater! i wouldn't really call it a poncho since it has standard sweater sleeves. it has a wide circle hem which is very flattering. i would have loved this even more if it were available in other colors besides white.... red, black, or navy would have been perfect!",5
"This sweater has instantly become a favorite. it is incredibly soft, the detailing is delicate and feminine, and the fit is cozy and flattering. the body has a definitive swing cut while the arms are slim - though not tight. i find the loose body, slim arm combination to be very flattering and forgiving. run out and buy this now if you love anywhere where it gets cold, foggy or dark -- it's a guaranteed go-to!",5
I happened upon a pair of these shorts that someone had returned. they are the perfect length. they are very well made. i have worn them to my son's baseball game and the sec tournament. they are tailored and have an interesting design. they make me look as though i have lost ten pounds. i am thrilled with them.,5
This is so beautiful and looks hand made but in a really good professional way. this will be a perfect fall wardrobe addition and i can't wait to wear it with a long sleeve top and jeans and boots. it's not too long and it is very flattering and soft and drapes well. love it.,5
"Beautiful and flattering, i am a 6 across the board but felt the small was too small. ordering a medium cause i need this beauty for fall.",5
"Living in florida, i thought the design of this sweatshirt was to die for. i was so pleased with the quality when i received the top; however i was nervous to see that it recommended washing before wearing due to the dying process. i washed cold gentle cycle and tumble dried low. turned out perfect and did not shrink! it's adorable. plan to wear it with white denim shorts. i ordered a size 1 and i normally wear a size small.",5
"Love this piece. can be worn casual or fancy. runs slightly big, but that seems to be the style. size down if you are in between sizes. the color is unique and organic. really comfortable and fun fabric.",5
Saw this in the store yesterday and had my daughter try it on. it was really cute on her and she loved it. in fairness to the other reviewers she tried on a size 0 which was perfect for her petite frame and i can see how this blouse would run really big in the larger sizes. but the fabric and detail is so pretty and it was on sale.,5
"Love this! only wish it wasn't so seasonal so i could wear it more often. this is the softest shirt in my wardrobe. can't believe how nice it feels on. a little bit slouchy and over-sized. i usually wear a m and bought a m and it feels perfect. like the other reviewer, i was a bit worried about shrinkage but washed it in cold and hung it up and and it cam out fine. did wash first before i wore because the dye smelled a bit strong.",5
"This dress is very soft and ultra comfortable. i got a size 10 and probably could have gotten away with an 8 but due to being busty on top stuck with the 10. i love the length ,even though i got the regular and not the petite.",5
"This blouse was just right for me. 5'3' and in my late fifties. not too frilly so still age appropriate yet feminine and fun. i have largish arms from working out and the sleeves fit with give. and at this stage of life, the boxy look that falls just below the waist is flattering. i took a 10 regular (i'm usually a medium r or m-petite) and the fit was comfortable and right. both colors are unusual and it works nicely with pants and skirts.",5
Love this vest!  just got it in the mail last week and i have already worn it twice with two different looks.  it's timeless and can be worn in so many fun ways!,5
"I just bought this dress yesterday in the store and love it. i'm 5'1"", 110#, 34b and purchased the 0p, which fits perfectly.

it's made of a cool material and is lined which adds to the quality of the dress. i love the neutral print and the square v-neck makes it a little different than just an average dress. this dress can be dressed up or down, depending on accessories. it also makes a great work dress if you add a little cardigan or blazer. very versatile and a great buy, especially a the s",5
"This dress looks better in person. the shape is pretty much straight, but fits nicely even if you are curvier. it doesn't show your imperfections. the type blue and white color is nice, but a bit see through on the bottom and the slip is a little short. came to about mid thigh for me so i would wear leggings underneath. i don't think a belt would look good with this because of the shape and if you have curves. very cool summer style.",5
"I honestly don't understand whey this top isn't sold out. i have it in both colors and love it! it's a cool, gauzy woven fabric, super soft and perfect for warm weather. the white fabric is doubled so it's not see-through, the pink (more of a pale terracotta) is doubled halfway up, so it's slightly sheer on top but your pants/skirt waistband will not show through. it is a loose-fitting top, so you may be able to size down. i usually wear size 4p, but it was sold out so i got regular size 2 and i",5
This is the perfect duster! transitions you perfectly from summer to fall without being an overly heavy piece. simple and classic! i know i will get a lot of wear out of this item!,5
"I'm fussy about robes. i'm fairly small (size 2 or 4) and a lot of robes swamp me. in the smaller size, this robe fit well and was flattering. the material is soft but absorbent. the pattern is lovely and feminine without being dowdy. the wrap is generous--i wear this robe just out of the shower and don't feel exposed.",5
I love this top! nice lightweight material but not too sheer. runs a little big and may be slightly too boxy for some people; for me it was perfect.,5
"This top is so pretty and festive. i am purchasing it for a holiday party. i debated between a m and l, but went with the m, and i'm glad i did. it is generously sized. finding bottoms for it has been a little tricky. i'm thinking i will try the velvet pants as shown.",5
I love this jacket! it is stylish and is ideal for a casual night out,5
This is my first time purchasing a bra from this brand and i am in love. the style and quality are amazing. it is the most comfortable bra i owned to date and i will be buying more from this line. it provides a lift without all of the uncomfortable padding which requires continuous adjusting. i am saying goodbye to vs forever. i got this in red and the bra looks more expensive than it actually is and the fit is simply amazing.it is sexy and classic at the same time.,5
"Well-made, gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person, which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs, etc.) 
you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.",5
"In the on-line picture this lightweight sweatshirt looked so inviting that i decided to order it. when it arrived, i could not believe how soft and comfortable it felt! it was equally comfortable on. the rayon, tencel and cotton content of the fabric created such a comfy feel, that this top is sure to be a favorite for a relaxing week-end or evening. i ordered the size 3 even though i usually order a small in most tops. this one seems to lend itself to the oversized look, and i was right about t",5
"Absolutely perfect for summer. great weight, lovely soft lining. love pockets in any robe. sleeve length is perfect. actually flattering, if you consider robes such a thing. i love it!",5
"This is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished! it is not a ""cheap polyester"" fabric as one reviewer wrote. it is a rayon and nylon blend. it does wrinkle easily. i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back. i don't typically gravitate toward warm color palette, but the burnt orange color is really lovely. it can be dressed up or down very easily. and it has pockets! i typically wear xs in retailer brands, and the size 0 fit me well.",5
I found this while shopping at my local retailer and loved it. i was able to size down from my normal 10 to a 6. i got the warm white and it's lovely - couldn't wait to wear it. the detail is so pretty and love the buttons and 3/4 length sleeves - i am thrilled! i couldn't be happier!,5
"I chose the petite small for the shorter length & fits perfectly. it falls abt 3"" below my knees. normally i am a small in tops. waiting for some cooler weather to wear with some of my swing style turtlenecks i have & jeans. 5'3"", 115#, 3c. looks pretty much on me as in the pic.",5
"Cute and comfy. seems to fit true to size. flattering and roomy on top for my 34ddd shape, but doesn't make me look pregnant or fat overall, which sometimes happens without a waist to define shape. super cute!",5
"Oh this skirt is gorgeous but i feel it runs small in the waist!!
i'm sending it back and ordered up- i'm happy i did as today it's sold out.
beautiful and vibrant colors, very well made- just wish some of the retailer sizes wouldn't run on the smaller side!!!",5
"These are my favorite jeans i've bought in the past year! they're the perfect length for booties, i love the rise, and the denim feels amazing- so soft. mine haven't stretched more than a normal jean (in fact they may have stretched less than others i've had), and i can wear then multiple times before washing with their shape being in tact.",5
"Love this top! so soft, fits perfect.",5
"This dress is absolutely adorable. runs true to size, i am five foot nine and a medium fit perfect. the denim has a lot of stretch. i can't wait to wear it in the winter with tights and boots! don't wait too long before this one sells out.",5
"I am a big fan of trench coats and i love that this one is navy. i typically gravitate toward blues because it brings out my eyes and my wardrobe tends to fall in a blue-ish category. i love that the color of this coat will compliment other pieces of clothing in my closet wonderfully.

i especially love the design of the trench with the wider, pleated bottom which allows for fluffier dresses but also creates an illusion that is slimming for anyone's figure. this is a fantastic, unique design for",5
"I love, love, love these jeans! they fit like a dream and the fabric is so soft and giving. the waist comes up higher and stays snug, which means no muffin top. plus they look awesome! i truly hope paige comes out with more like this!!",5
Very comfortable sweater. the material is very soft and not itchy at all. i had the hardest time deciding between sizes. the medium was slightly longer and loose through the arms. a bit of a boxy shape. the small was slightly more fitted through the arms and instead of hanging straight had a slight fit and flare look to it but still loose. ended up going with a small since it was less boxy. it's a sweater that can look more put together or more laid back just depending on sizing but overall love,5
Absolutely love this skirt. it is well made and fits as normal. i love the fact that it can be dressed up or down.,5
"This coat is fun, flirty, & flattering. i bought it strictly for how good it looks on - it's not a coat for warmth. the top is tailored and fitted, but the bottom is very full and swings. (there is a lot of fabric on the bottom). i'm not sure why some people had a hard time with the sleeves - i do not have the smallest arms and this was not an issue for me. however, i had a very thin shirt underneath the coat and that is all you can fit under it, so keep that in mind. the small fit me perfect. v",5
"This skirt is beautiful. fabric is gorgeous,with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it. there is a ""life ""in this skirt; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way. or,i better say, it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it. unfortunately, it stretched more than a full size, and generally lost its shape. now, the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore.",1
"Pretty cut out design. it is a great length for work but it is also unique enough to get compliments. the skirt seems true to size but the waist does not have a lot of ""give."" in this regard it may seem a little small.",5
"I saw this in an email and loved it but by the time i tried to order it that evening, some sizes were already gone. the medium was back-ordered but didn't have to wait too long to receive it.. i especially like the design with the full skirt. the material is light weight, which is prefect for my florida climate. the design and fit were beautiful!!! i love it and will get years of use out of it. my only complaint is the material wrinkles very easily. i tried to get them out myself but ended up se",5
"I had to size up to a medium because otherwise my boobs would not get along well with that button down front, but once that was taken care of i really loved the silhouette this created. the belted waist flatters an hourglass shape nicely. perfect for sipping tea and eating finger pastries like a fancy little lady. i have no idea what i'm going to do when the time comes to wash it though... we'll cross that road when we come to it, i guess. also - the interior seams are a bright, electric blue -",5
"This skirt is great for anyone who wants to highlight a defined waistline, but may want to skim over a few lumps and bumps. the skirt has a nice, wide waistband that hugs tight at the middle and pleats that give a little flare without being too much.

the fabric is nice and thick and the skirt is lined.

i am looking forward to wearing it to the office with a fitted dark top and heels.",5
"This was sold out in an xs when i first saw the email. i ended up seeing in my local retailer store and tried on my usual xs. i am 5'3"" with a longer torso and about 108 pounds. my chest size is 32c and the xs was just too tight. it buttoned up beautifully and the length was as it is on the model, even though i am much shorter. however, when i tried to move my arms, the jacket constricted all movement. this is a huge disappointment and i imagine going to be an issue for many girls who order online",5
"I was looking for a dress for an upcoming interview. this fit the bill. when i took it out of the packaging i was worried it would be boxy, but it hit in all the right places. it was loose enough allowing for movement, but accentuated my waist. it hangs to just above my knee in an xl (i typically wear a 14-16). i was very impressed with the material. it feels very soft and luxurious.",5
"I purchased this in-store in a vivid red color, but didn't try it on until i got home. big mistake! literally the first time i tried to zip the dress, the cheap, horrible zipper noted in previous reviews just...broke. midway up, right under the waist tie. i was trapped in the dress for a good 15 minutes and was scared i'd have to rip or cut the fabric to get out of it; eventually i pulled the zipper apart to escape. can't wait to return this asap.",1
"I like the edge of this dress and it balances my narrower hips well. i'm usually between 0p and 00p in retailer dresses and xxsp definitely fit better on my 5'1"" frame (armpits and knee-length where it should be)

love that it's machine washable and unusual. super soft and beautiful color even though i normally gravitate to cooler colors.

bring it on everleigh!",5
"I love the bright red color and also the texture of fabric. it's light, soft and crisp, which is perfect for summer days. the dress is definitely designed for people with a short torso. the waste line is a bit high for me, but overall it didn't feel weird or look funny. there is just something about this dress that made me very difficult to part with. once i tried it on, i had to bring it home with me!",5
"I was a little worried this top wouldn't look quite as nice as it does online due to the price, but it is super cute in person too. tank underneath is attached but does not get in the way. great top! cannot wait to wear it!",5
"The cut and color of the dress is awesome. however, the biggest flaw is the zipper. i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke..sad day especially at the price. there also were a number of loose threads. i recommend waiting until it goes on sale. you'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper.",1
"My only complaint is that there is no lining. it also came very wrinkly and i need to figure out how to steam it.

however the fit is perfect (tts) and it is so very flattering!",5
"First of all, i'm not a ""navy"" person at all. i much prefer black or other bright colors. i received an e'mail showing this trench last saturday and i pulled it up online and noticed how darling it looked. i didn't order it, but i went back the following day to check it out again. it was nowhere on the website. then a few days ago, back it popped up online again. i noticed it wasn't in my local store so i thought i'd go in and look this weekend. i just had to see it. i actually made it to the st",5
"Saw this on the retailer emails as a cover and knew i had to try it on. went into the store following day and tried it. to my delight the tencel fabric is light enough for southern california weather and can be worn as a trench coat over skinny jeans, leggings or dresses or act as a dress in itself! love the navy color as it is has more of a washed looked and not too bold. what attracted me to this piece in the first place was the ruffled bottom and the rounded flaps on the back that is different",5
"This sweet little number in the mustard yellow has become my fall and winter ""go-to"" sweater. so easy to wear, understated and a bit retro. looks great tucked into skirts or high-waisted jeans, or out, and the subtle shift in textures is a nice detail. highly recommend, and a great price point!",5
"The skirt on this trench has tons of fabric. it goes on and on, and drapes and twirls beautifully. as a trench, it fits well and does the trick. i believe the skirt is heavy enough not to blow around too much, but i haven't been out in extremely strong winds yet. it fits true to size, at the knee (i'm 5'5""). i sized up because i assumed i would be layering it over clothes. my regular size fit fine over a lightweight cardigan.",5
"The green is vibrant and beautiful, and the sweater is very soft.",5
"Love this skirt! i enjoy being trendy, but i love the retro vibe. can be dressed up, or worn to work.",5
"Very pretty skirt, makes me feel very feminine and makes my waist look smaller than it is.",5
This coat is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is soft and almost silky and the style is timeless. i ordered an xs and it fits true to size and has excellent quality.,5
"I usually wear a s petite so that's what i initially got in this. i'm 5'2"", 32c-27-36. the shoulders were about an inch too wide on either side, the sides along the top had tons of extra fabric (almost like batwings or a dolman cut) and the waist was at least 6"" too big! i'm re-ordering in petite xs and hoping for the best, because this is a gorgeous coat.",5
"This sweater is flattering, fun, and practical. i wear to work and out at night to dressier functions. i bought both the green and black. both are cute on and super soft.",5
"After being tentative to splurge on skinny jeans (i've always been a small flare jean-girl), i am thrilled to say i love these jeans. the rise is perfect in that it ""holds in"" anything you want ""held in"" and makes a slim shirt look even better. i have worn them with booties and regular boots alike and have no complaints. i was unsure of the jean's claim to not stretch out but have been pleasantly surprised at how they have kept their shape...even after sitting for many hours at a time. wash cold",5
"Can't say enough about the style of this trench, the material is soft and the shape is amazing for all body types. the color is great and there's some pretty aqua colored piping in the inside of the coat.

the sizing is a little hmmm. i ordered a large. i'm usually a 12 on top or a large, mostly to accommodate a larger chest (ddd i think). proportion wise i'm more a medium through the shoulders and in length, so sometimes i can size down to a medium or large petite depending on the shape.

"I've been buying and returning several denim shorts lately searching for the right pair. these are fantastic. they are so so soft and comfy. i'd say they run slightly big but not to the point where i needed to size down like i do with the hyphen chinos. love that they are not so short but not too long either and can be adjusted by how you roll them. these are a nice medium wash and i am 5'5"" 110 lbs and went w my normal size 26. seems like they may stretch out a little but that's ok bc then they",5
I am very pleased with this skirt! you can tell it is very well made and is just beautiful! very true to size!,5
This product has a terrible zipper that ultimately caused me to return the dress. it's pretty bad when it won't even zip up on the hanger. such a beautiful dress; it broke my heart!,1
"This trench coat solves my eternal problem with trench coats - which is that when i see one on a model in an ad they look effortless and casual, but then when i try one on it looks rigid and stuffy somehow. this trench coat drapes beautifully. that said, it's not the same kind of fabric as a traditional trench coat so it probably isn't water resistant. i'm fine with that, it looks amazing.",5
So happy this came back into stock! beautiful trench! love the flared skirt. the coat is perfect for the warming weather here on the east coast. it adds elegance and sophistication to any outfit. a must!,5
"I knew i needed to buy this trench from the moment i saw it on my computer screen, but something prompted me to stop by my local retailer and try it on first. thank goodness for that.

at first glance, i knew i wouldn't be buying this. the construction leaves much to be desired. from the flimsy, single layer of unlined, unstructured fabric, to the thin strip of fabric serving as a belt, i could easily see this being sold at a cheap store for teenage girls where throwaway clothes are a dim",1
"Cute skirt! i bought it to go with boots (tall and short) and looks great. if you pair it with the right top, it reminds me of the funky eclectic retailer look that this retailer is famous for! i usually wear a size 2 or 4 and i went with the 2 because it didn't hang so low. but that's just me.",5
"Got this style in both black and green. the fabric is soft and the neck design is very elegant! i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.",5
"I want to wear this skirt every day - it's so much fun to wear and versatile and i just feel great wearing it!
can dress it up or down - it's pretty darn fabulous!
i highly recommend it - you'll be grateful and feel pretty!",5
I saw this trench in an email a couple weeks back and instantly fell in love. i bought it for myself for my birthday and got it just the other day and it is just as beautiful in person as it is online. fits true to size and is so flattering. i love the true navy color and cannot wait to wear this on cool spring nights!!,5
"It goes without saying that trenches are timeless. but this one broke the mold with its femininity in the flare and the (finally!) different color. i saw this and put it in my cart, debated, and went back a few days later (as i always end up doing, because i could not live without it) and it was no longer available! i was devastated and could have kicked myself. but i waited a bit longer, went back on the website and thank god - retailer had ordered more from the designer and had replenished stock",5
"This dress looks better when wearing, i am 5.8 regular size s or 6. cup 34 d and fits perfect. length and width. in the front is shorter while the back has that pretty extra length. the video that is showing here is pretty much the full length.  but in case you need to adjust you can shorten easily. i wish the slip is the same length as the dress. i want this dress for a wedding anniversary by the beach so i will need to add some extra fabric. i hope it helps.",5
I love this dress because it is everything i have been looking for. it is flattering because of the details and it gives the illusion of an hourglass figure if you don't have one. i love that it has sleeves because sometimes i just don't feel like finding a shawl or bolero or whatever in case i get suddenly anxious about my arms. the green is dark and shimmering almost like lace over jewel tone emerald. love.,5
"I feel like this brand is very good at coming up with dresses that are flattering and i feel like they tend to fit my body well. i like the design of the dress a lot because it makes me feel like i am walking along with beach-it gets me in the mood for summer, and it is the perfect casual everyday dress for the summer. i love that the color scheme is understated which reinforces that this could be warn anywhere-even for everyday use. the strips are perfect for the look of this dress, and i don't",5
"This tee is super comfortable. it feels and looks like a well worn favorite right off the rack. although it only comes in s-m-l sizes and i wear an xs ( 32a/b, 105 lbs) the small fits well. no gaping armhoes to worry about. the pics don't show that the tee does trapeze out somewhat but it is not to worry about. i purchased the reddish color which is a wonderful faded maroon shade. i will be getting the black one as well.",5
"I love this shirt. it's different than other summer tops. it's pretty much as pictured in terms of color and size, and runs true to size. on a windy day the front will come open, but only to your stomach.",5
"The dress is pretty, i ordered a 4 and 6 not knowing how it ran, i took both back the neck is too tight!",1
"I just received this dress in petite extra small. for reference, i am 5""7 and 118 pounds. to answer the previous reviewer's question, the regular size of this dress runs long. if you want it to look like the one in the video, then order it in petite. i personally love the style and the material. however, the inside slip is very short with the petite given my height but this can be solved by adding a half slip underneath it.",5
"Love the pattern play on this skirt! i had to size up to a 6 (i usually take a 2 or 4 in skirts) as it was too snug in the hips/waist. going up a size worked well and the hem hit me at the knee (i'm 5' 6""). thought it looked cute with the cloth & stone chambray tank :)",5
"I normally don't write reviews for clothing but this dress warrants an exception.

i am a little over six months pregnant and have a shotgun wedding at city hall in a couple of weeks. with a limited amount of time to plan, i bought a bunch of pregnant wedding dresses online and rented the runway, to arrive just before the actual ceremony. out of curiosity, i walked into retailer today to see if they had any white or ivory dresses that would look cute and city hall wedding-ish. they did! so i too",5
"This dress is made with stretchy cottony fabric, yet, very forgiving. it fits like a glove but doesn't show bulges. fit is perfect, i had originally purchased the white and grey, but the petite length is better. too bad as i do love me some red. oh well.",5
"5""5', 130, 32dd. i saw this dress online and thought it was beautiful, but considered not buying it because of other comments that the bust was too small for women with more curves. fortunately, the lovely blue dress was in my local retailer store and i decided to try it on in a size 4. i think the dress fits perfectly and i have gotten many compliments, including from random strangers. i have had no problem with a tight zipper or a low back, which is perfectly able to cover my bra in the back. th",5
"Online this dress caught my eye but the reviews seemed to indicate there was something weird with the length so i did not want to order it online and have to send it back etc...because i am 5'5"" and did not know weather to get the petite or the regular! my local store had it and i bought a regular small and it is not too long. it comes just to the ground in the back like any other maxi. it is super comfortable and gorgeous! i am not sure where i am going in it yet....but it was just too pretty o",5
"The fitted top and flared skirt are really nice on this piece. i am 5'6"" 125lb and i took a 6. a 4 might have been ok, but i felt more comfortable in the 6, and it had a really nice fit.

the quality is good, but there were some areas that were starting to pull and the floral details come a little frayed around the cutout edges, so i'm not sure how it will wear.",5
"I specifically bought this dress for my bridal shower and loved it! i'm small on top and have hips that don't lie. i purchased the size 2 petite. the waist portion of the dress came up a little higher which was ok since it fell at a small part of my waist. the length was just above my knee, which i prefer. the dress has a nude lining which compliments my tan skin tone. i wore a regular nude bra that didn't show beneath the liner. i received many compliments and would highly recommend it.

"I feel in love with the dress when i saw it hanging at the store. usually, i feel bailey 44 dresses make my body look really round and short. i've passed up a few because i didn't find them too flattering. i almost even just passed this one up because of my past experiences, but i tried it on and felt like i had the body of another person! it hugged my body very nicely and i felt like it gave me a shape! i also saw all the possibilities it had. the store had it styled with a denim jacket. i can",5
This skirt is adorable. there is no give to it though. i usually wear a 4/6 and got the 4 and i can't gain a pound or it won't zip. it is perfect for spring and summer. i'm 5'8 135.,5
This skirt caught my eyes right away in the clearance section. i would have tried size 2 but it wasn't available. however size 4 fitted just fine. the print has bright summery feel to it. the lines on skirt are more carrot orange than it is to red. fabric is soft.,5
"I find it very difficult to find office friendly yet unique designs and feel this one fits the bill and also has the ability to be dressed up for the evening. i am ""curvy on bottom"" so i sized up from my normal retailer 4 to a 6 and surprisingly the dress fit my hips just fine. i'm 5'8"" 140 about 36-27-36 if it helps as i know it's hard to determine sometimes if this style will fit a more curvy figure...my advice is to go up a size if you are. the fabric i found true to the photo and the emerald i",5
"I read the other reviews on this skirt and tried the 4 and the 6 (i'm between the two sizes, typically) in case it ran small. technically it does. the 4 is tighter, but it looks better sitting higher on my waist. the 6 is looser, but doesn't look as good. likely sticking with the 4. the colors are gorgeous and the fabric is light and high quality. it can be dressed up or down.",5
"I've been looking for a dress to wear to wedding this summer, and this is it. the blue color is lovely and the lace overlay is feminine and pretty. i'm small busted (34aa) with an athletic lower body (think, 120-lb marathoner), and the flare of this dress is perfect. i ordered this in a 0 and a 0 petite. the petite size looked little-girl short; the regular size hit just at my knee and was much more sophisticated. the waistband also fell at a more flattering place in the regular dress. i'm on th",5
"I bought this skirt for an end of summer ""caribbean"" party. the floral detail is even more fun in person. it looks great with a red top or black tank.",5
I love this dress's gentle blue lace. the silhouette is just as seen in the pictures. i found the dress tight in the chest and had to size up one size (6 to 8).,5
The dress looks even better in person. the fabric is very delicate though but worth the extra care it needs. the fit was perfect and the color is just as in the picture.,5
"I wore this top right out of the package i loved it so much. i am 5'8"" small busted and size 4 was great. the sleeves hit me perfectly. the pleated detail in the back is flattering as well. my daughter now wants her own top. it would be nice to have a second color option.",5
Top opens in the middle right in front. should have some sort of closure inside to prevent this top from flying open will return,1
Very pretty dress! wearing it for a family beach portrait. it may run a little big but not terribly. it is also not super long as pictured. i'm 5'6 and it's perfect with a flat.,5
"This one is a beauty! my store is not carrying the white - they had a lovely blue (periwinkle-ish) that immediately caught my eye. the ivory model shot makes the details of the lace and top layer really pop - more so than the blue variety but both are stunning. the details and layers on this dress are lovely and intricate without feeling overly delicate. quality most definitely in line with the price.

"I love this top. i'm not one to iron, so i wash (and hang dry) and wear it. great with skinny jeans.",5
"In the photo, this looks like a heavy knit top, but it's not. the fabric is very light, thin, and soft. it's like a knit nightgown material. i said this runs big b ecause i'm normally a size xl and i can wear this. it actually fits me a little less flowy than on the model and i think looks better. so, to me, you can size down if you want this not to have so much flowing fabric.

"This dress is so short! i double checked to make sure i didn't get a petite by mistake.  i'm 5'10 and ordered an extra small because of the deep v neck. it fit well on top, but  you could see my underwear in the front. seriously, i dont even think miley cirus would wear it that short. the lace was really beautiful so i was disappointed that it didn't work out.",1
"Really cute dress. i bought the white. i am usually a size 2 in retailer dresses but i could not even zip this! side zip was also slightly awkward. had to return, waiting for the 4.",5
"I bough this dress in blue and i cannot tell you the compliments and the looks i get on the street! no kidding! this is a beautiful dress which has a very feminine/romantic quality to it. i bought size 4 and it sits perfectly on my waist i completely fell in love with that dress and especially with the lace work and the design. this is a classic piece, that is always going to be timeless in my opinion. no regret at all to have bought it!",5
I wanted to love this top -- looks so comfy and cute. but hangs like a bag. going back!,1
"I knew the ivory color was online only so i tried the blue one for size and i couldn't believe how nice the blue one is. i ended up buying it. i purchased a size bigger because mine wasn't available but because of lace and side zip, it still doesn't look huge. if i find my size in another store i can always exchange, but i couldn't leave the dress behind.",5
"This cozy sweater has the feel of cashmere. it fits loose and has a similar look as a wrap or poncho. looks better over sleeveless or short sleeve tops. i'm surprised it isn't one size fits all b/c it is very generous in the xs/s, which i got and i'm a 6. i can see wearing this all year long, even summer cool nights. very classic style. the picture on website looks frumpy to me, but on it is very flattering.",5
"I am a short frame with broad shoulders and a large chest which means peplum tops typically look horribly unflattering on my frame. not this top! the cut is very flattering due to the lower peplum. not too much fabric to add to the waistline, truly a perfect fit. if this top came in any other colors, i would buy them all.",5
Wonderful colors and fit tts. love the style. can were on or off the shoulders . love it!!!,5
"First i found the picture of this blouse stunning because the colors caught my attention . with that said, i found myself thinking of all the many events this could worn to, dressed up or down. so.... i found myself ordering it asap, paranoid that others were thinking i was thinking the same thing. well , i received it in the mail , and it was better than i thought!!! the colors and cut of this blouse is just as in the picture. i personally love this article/pattern of art, as i see it as an exp",5
I love the way this fits and feels on. it is a beautiful piece and makes me happy to wear. i ordered my usual size medium and it fits well. the only con is that it is dry clean only.,5
"I love everything about this sweater. it is very well made, beautiful material and such an effortless way to pull it all together. it runs large which was unfortunate for me as i bought the xs petite and i really need xxs in this one, but none are left. i am 5 ft. tall and weigh about 96 pounds. i can wear a 0 but not in this sweater. it runs very well and i highly recommend it. hope they make more in this style. it is so fresh looking and so comfortable.",5
I love everything bordeaux so when i saw this one i knew i needed to try it and it's my favorite top from this brand ever. i hope they keep the style and offer it in all of the colors going forward. it's a very flattering style for anyone - accentuates shape without being tight or clingy and the stripes are lovely. also the material is so soft. i have not washed it yet so i hope it stands up to wash and wear well. overall this is an amazing top. it runs slightly large. i'm usually an xs in tops,5
"I agree with the previous review, i too would not have purchased it if i had not tried it in the store (which is 2 hrs from my house!). the colors are much more saturated but not gaudy. the caveat, it is quite short. i am 5'10"", 135 lbs. i purchased a medium as it gave me the length i needed.",5
"I'm so thrilled with these! the fabric is a little heavier, and they just fit really well when similar styles tend to be baggy.",5
"The heart version is very pretty, i can't speak for the striped one as i have not seen that one in person. i ordered the xxs after trying on the xs, as i felt the petite would be perhaps too short. the xs was a little big on me. the only problem with xxs regular is the sleeves are longer on me, like 3/4 length, not to elbow as shown on model. but i don't want the shirt to be too short so sticking with that size.

for reference, i am 115 lbs, 30dd chest, 26.5 in waist, and short.",5
"Truthfully, i wouldn't have looked twice at this shirt online. i came across it at my local retailer store and i'm so glad i did. the colors are more vivid and beautiful in person. i purchased the small (my normal size) and it hits at the waist.",5
"I agree completely with the previous reviews suggesting that this top is much prettier in person! i failed to notice this top online, but was drawn to it in the store (the green color). it is perfect for early fall weather. although i could probably wear the xs, i ordered the xxs online after trying on the xs because i wanted it to be a bit shorter and have less extra fabric in hopes that it would be just that much more flattering.",5
This is the second tulle skirt by bailey 44 that i have bought. the color is a little more grey blue than the picture online but the quality is excellent. i am normally a size 6 and i purchased this skirt in medium and fits fine. it is a pull-on skirt but the waistband doesn't have a lot of stretch to it.,5
"I love any bow tie tops but most have the bow too high up which looks dowdy. i love the layered look and the contrasting colors. i am 100 lbs, 5'3"" and got the regular xs. i wanted the petite xs but it was sold out unfortunately. the regular was a little too big but it still works! looks great with jeans or dress pants....even a skirt! very versatile and classy and creative styling.",5
"This skirt is perfect. i'm a size 10 and i'm 48 years old. i've really been wanting a tulle skirt, but didn't want to look like baby huey in it a bip puffy tutu above my knees. this skirt is indicative of the quality that is bailley 44. the fit is great, the length is perfect. i plan to wear it with a chambray shirt and the burgundy colored obi belt.",5
"It was love at first sight when i saw this dress online. the color, cut and delicate details are perfectly balanced with a moderately sexy neckline! ladylike with a little attitude. the fabric is gorgeous and is a stunning shade of midnight blue. this dress is perfect for a summer beach party or to attend a wedding. cut is extremely flattering, and the halter tie top allows for adjustment for a perfect fit.

"This is a beautiful dress with so many interesting textures and colors. it is form-fitting yet modest enough to wear for so many occasions - i plan to wear it for my son's graduation, but i think there are many potential uses for this dress. be aware that, like many byron lars sheath dresses, the bottom part is very tight- makes it hard to fit for more pear-shaped people. the top is a tad loose on me while the bottom is quite snug. however if i go up or down a size it will be too big on top or t",5

"Love, love, love this top. i want to wear it every day! not only is it striped, which is super chic, but also, the peplum hits lower so it really accentuates your waistline (in a good way!). plus, its soft, like so many wonderul bordeaux tops are. i wish they had this is solid colors because i'd buy them all. for reference, i bounce between an xs and s at retailer, more along the lines of s...and i got the xs in this and it still has room (5'7, 135 lbs, 34a/b chest).",5
"I always chuckle when i see this dress because it looks so busy and so crazy with all the mixed prints, i think it's a lot of fun. not so fun to put on, but it's worth the trouble. i swear my shoulders are sore after manipulating this on myself. i also own the mona dress in 8p, but i had to size down to a 6 for the melodist because the hips were not fitted enough and the back bloused out too much.",5
I love this top. it looks as great in person as it does on-line. it does require some adjustment while wearing because it slips up onto the shoulders more than i prefer. the quality is nice and it is very pretty. it is great with skinny jeans and heels for a fall look.,5

"Bypassed this blouse online, but it's striking colors caught my eye at the store. bought the olive green color and it's gorgeous! the color is great for both spring and fall. i'm normally a petite xs at 5'0 feet and 104 pounds, the regular xs is a great fit for me. not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist. material is lighweight and flowey. don't hesitate to buy, it's a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans..",5
"Beautiful fall colors, perfect with work pants or jeans. i'm tall and was a little worried it would be too short, but it was a good fit.",5

"This swing tee is amazing! i bought the blue one and the color is true to what it looks like online. the material is so soft and cozy. i am typically an xs and bought an xs, however it runs ever so slightly big. if i had purchased the xxs, it seems like the arms would have been to tight and i'm definitely not a fan of that. whatever the case, i highly recommend this tshirt and love its versatility and that i can wear this all year long.",5
"This looked like a simple, chic blouse, but the fabric felt cheap to me, like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.",1
I bought this in red and wear it a lot. it is so soft and comfortable! i love all the fabric and the design. the longer sleeve length is amazing! it is a perfect tee! you can tell from the pics there's a lot a fabric and it's supposed to be loose and drape like that. it fits like in the pics and is true to size. wear a tank underneath in case there's a strong wind.,5
"I am a sucker for a good swing top. i own many styles from retailer and similar retailers. i carry my weight in my stomach butt and hips, so this style is always good for me. as soon as i saw this online i fell hard and waited patiently for it to arrive at my store. finally it did! i love this top. its very swingy. almost cut like a circle so there is tons of room in the body. the sleeve is more fitted, but my arms are larger so it might just be fitted for me. there is a bit of stretch to it. the",5
"I love this blouse, it looks great under a blazer dressed up and great with boyfriend jeans.
it is loose and flowy, the neck line is low. i bought a medium and it is a little large but fits with the style of the top.
i happen to love the fabric, it is soft and feels great on the skin. one of my favorite fabric combinations is rayon (viscose) and cotton.",5
Awesome shirt...great transition into fall. somewhat sheer. extremely comfortable!,5
"This top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape. the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to ""bloop"" open constantly. the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i couldn't get to look good.

i'm busty, but this isn't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me. the blouse fits tts and everything was covered, so it's not like it was too small and tugged. that's not the case. this blouse just didn't",1

Didn't like the dress. look pregnant in it. this dress is going back.,1
Love these vegan leather pants. the fit is great for my petite frame. i bought them in regular size because the petite sold out so fast. i just got them hemmed of course. i love the fit but i also loved the color. the green was a just a little bit different and took me away from the basic black,5
The first day i wore this dress to work i was amazed by how many people commented on it! i knew i liked it but apparently so does everyone else!,5

Beautiful dress. when you look at it on the hanger you think this could be really good or really bad. but it is absolutely beautiful. would highly recommend it - can dress it up or down.,5

"I have been continually disappointed in retailer's clothing for the past year. i feel like their prices have soared and the quality has remained so-so, but dresses like these somehow make the cut. it does not make sense. since when did retailer exclusively market to older women? no, retailer's market has always been young adults. this dress is extremely matronly. although the bottom print is nice, the hot pink belt?? is completely mismatched and gaudy. i really hope retailer starts curating better dress",1
"Can't say enough about this cute dress....i bought it in red/ which is more of a burgundy, and paired it with a pair of over the knee burgundy boots. i can see wearing this in the spring, summer; heck, all year round! quality is nice and the gold zipper down the top of the back is a classy touch. don't pass this one up!",5
"Purchased this in the wine color and love it! the detail at the neck at the bottom hem gives it an extra flair. i went with a small so that it was more fitted. love that it is stylish and comfortable. paired with knee high boots given it length but could also work well with short boots, like the photo.",5
I ordered this in black and in the print and i am super happy with both. the fabric is very soft. i've worn it with denim and khaki shorts as well as with a cute skirt for work. very versatile.,5
I tried these on when they were full price and waited for them to go on sale and was very excited when they did! i'm not the type to buy leather pants but these look like i can dress them up or down and dress them like jeans. i'm a size 26 in pants but i bought size 25. i highly recommend!,5

Beautiful embroidery and good quality jeans. you can really dress up with these for special occassion.,5
"These are great pants, have them in the green holly color",5
"These jeans are pricey and worth every dollar.  fits in the right area and makes your butt look perfect.  ladies, if you have thick legs...these jean are meant for you.",5
The photos do not do this dress justice. i loved it as soon as i tried it on! it is good quality and the fabric is not too thin. definitely recommend!,5
"I love dolan dresses! the fabrics are always beautiful, and the colors are always unique. i usually wear an xs petite in dolan, but i ordered both the xs and the xs petite, and i think i'm going to keep the xs. i had a hard time deciding which to keep, but the xs petite was just a hair too short. i think this is a versatile dress for all seasons. you could pair it with tights in fall/winter, but it is great for spring/summer, too...",5
"I love this skirt!! it slips seamlessly from day to night, and looks great on those of us who happen to be on the taller side. it's super warm, so it's perfect with tights and boots on those colder winter evenings out.",5
"Great length, very comfortable, very pretty. perfect dressy winter skirt!",5
"I ordered a medium as the large in the store was a bit too big. i wore this dress to a casual dinner at the grill in the country club and felt so cute, but also comfortable. i think it is a flattering dress shape and fabric. looks just like pictured on your website.",5
"I really love this dress. the material has a lovely feel to the skin, silky. i typically wear a large (occasionally a medium). if i wanted this dress to look like the model it would be the large. i ended up going with a medium because i wanted to accentuate the smallest part of me (rib cage area). this made the black portion a tad snug around the bum, but it eased a bit with wear (but still tighter than model picture)
size down if you want it snug, normal size for a looser, boxier fit. either w",5
"This dress by dolan is my go to favorite for work. it gives a polished look with a pair of booties.i purchased it in an xs. i'm 5'1 and c-d cup. fit me perfectly. i can't wait to team it up with a sweater for chillier fall days. you will get a ton of compliments with this dress. love, love , love.",5
"I immediatley bought this adorable dress after trying it on at my local retailer and absolutely love it! it fits tts for me in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it's incredibly soft and comfortable to wear. the top portion is so great as it has nice short sleeves, the color is a nice deep, rich orange which looks great now in the summer but will look especially cute in the fall with tall boots and a light denim jacket plus the bottom half is cut in such an interesting way. the material is amaz",5
"I have been needing a perfect go-to white tee for layering purposes and this one met and exceeded my expectations. it's the perfect weight for year-round use, love that it's 3/4 sleeves (again great for year round), and the slight front v adds a nice special touch. fell in love with the first one i bought online, so ordered a second for backup. it's a winner (and great price)!",5
"Very comfortable dress and cool for our hot summers. i ordered in my normal size medium. neckline is cut a little low, but not enough to change my mind on the purchase.",5
I loved this dress so much i got it in two colors. the colors match the picture online. it's very soft and will work for summer and fall.,5
"I have an hourglass shape, so this skirt is winner for me. classic a-line fit but with a modern hem. it's subtly shiny, very stylish, and comfortable. paired with a tight shirt and heels it looks extremely sexy. a sale price makes it all the sweeter.",5
I love this dress! it's so comfortable and perfect for the summer fall transition. it fits true to size and isn't to boxy or tight. i love the colors as well!,5
"I bought this dress tonight and i love it! the fit is perfect and the color is perfect! the dress runs true to size, as all dolan products do. i ill wear this dress to an interview with tall heel boots. love this dress and think everyone should give it a try!",5
I loved this dress so much i got it in 2 colors. i had to send it back twice to get the size right. i ended up with a medium. the fabric was pretty wrinkly on arrival. it is dryclean only. overall it is an easy and relaxed dress appropriate for work but still very cute.,5
This skirt fits in a strange way. there is one pleated area but it is on the side so it is not flattering and i kept feeling as if i wanted to straighten the skirt.. the elastic looks frumpy. unflattering.,1
"I'm in love ... with this super cute dress!!! the material feels so good on my skin and it has more 'body' than it appears on the pic ! i'm 5'2"" 115 lbs - i bought the s petite and it's perfect for me - slightly loose - i could have probably fit in an xs but i like the freedom that the s gives me! it my official spring dress !",5
"Bought this in navy in the spring and this fall in green. i am 5'10"" and 57 with very long legs and they are too short to be work appropriate as a dress, at least for me. i wear both with leggings, short boots and a variety of jackets and love them. they feel like butter against the skin and are incredible comfortable. recommend. for reference i'm about 157# and an athletic/straight build and bought m in the blue and l in the green. go figure.",5
"Spied this dress in my local retailer and figured i would try it on for overall fit before ordering the petite on line. for some reason retailer has eliminated in-store petite items (so disappointing). i was pleasantly surprised the xs regular fit well and was soon in my checkout pile. the dress is very soft although i suspect it will wrinkle when packed in a suitcase. the color blocking is great and makes this dress so versatile for spring, summer and fall. the xs regular fit my 5'1"" 115 lb",5
"As t-shirts go, this one has a flattering fit...shapely waist yet not so tight that unwanted curves show. i bought the striped one in my usual medium and it fits perfect now, so will have to be careful when washing. if it were available, i would have tried the large, so if you're a tad senitive about tight clothes i suggest upsizing. it's a nice weight fabric and the details around the v neck are great....the v dips just like the photo - approprialty sexy and age appropriate (i'm 62, 5'3"" at 125",5
"I love this tee. it has a very flattering fit and the fabric is very soft. it runs small, especially in the arms. i suggest sizing up. the tee looks great on. it is slimming and super comfortable.",5
"Love this skirt, i ordered a small, i'm 5'1, about 120, still losing some baby weight, so the elastic band is really nice because it will still fit once i get down to 110. really love the cut, it falls just above my knees in the front, longer in back. i wore it to church with a cream top with victorian lace around neck, tucked in, and added a belt for a nicer finish, although the band looks good without the belt too. i got tons of compliments from everyone. definitely a score.
(p.s. shoes are fr",5
I love this simple but stylish t shirt - the fabric is soft and it fits true to size and i knew i would love it even before it was delivered. i recommend it!!,5
"This is such a lovely dress -- and it looks great on! like other customers, i like the petal hem and the top part, which is stretchy, is soft and not clingy.
 
i think the only drawback is that the color isn't as rich a green as it looks in the pic. i've attached a pic for comparison and contrast purposes.

i'll be wearing this way into the fall!",5
"This dress is great! the fit is perfect and very flattering. the two colors and asymmetrical hem on the front make it different than you average sundress. looks great with flip flops, sandals, wedges or booties. will be a great piece for summer but the darker colors also make it the perfect transition to fall dress.",5
"I love the color combo, look and feel to this dress. 5'4, 120lbs and the xs fits as pictured.",5
It is the cutest detailed little white top. i recommend this because you can wear it anywhere and dress it up with a scarf.,5
"Everything about this dress is perfect...the material, style, and fit. flattering and comfortable. i'm 5'9"" and the length was just above the knee. you can dress it up or down. comfortable. i definitely recommend.",5
I purchased this for my 20-something daughter. it is so complimentary and cute and stylish!,5
"I saw the colorblock horizon dress in my local store (which sadly no longer carries petites) in the red/black color combination and loved it - the colorsblocking, the fabric, the length. after ordering a few petite sizes online the only xsp was the green/black. although not what i would normally where colorwise, i love this dress and the xsp is the only one that fits. this dress runs large and on a smaller frame, the sp looked shapeless and unattractive. perfect length and attractive v-neck that",5
I love this skirt. it fits perfectly. great to transition from work to after-work event. very comfy. got lots of complements.,5
I ordered this skirt because it looked cute and versatile. when it arrived the pleat in front (shown in the center) was far to the right so the overall look was crooked. not sure if it was a quality control issue or if that's the true design but it will have to go back. too bad because i had high hopes!,1
I am petite but chesty and this dress is flattering. it is a loose fit but not tight across the bust line. i tried it on with nude shoes and it dresses it up. i ended up buying this dress in a regular cut (s) because i wanted it to not be so short which made it look more like a casual dress to wear with the ocean behind you. i think it is a perfect day dress to go anywhere and by changing your shoes or adding a thin sweater or short jacket you can go out to dinner or theatre. the picture is a tr,5
My favorite new dress. i love the feel and slight weight of the fabric. it's very flattering and easy to wear.,5
Love this shirt! got it in white and it will be perfect for spring! very flattering fit!,5
"I really like this piece; the fit is great, the double zipper falters and cinched waist and 3/4 sleeves flatter. i will say, it's pricey for what it is (a cardigan) - but it's a great, versatile closet staple.",5
"At first i didn't like the way this skirt hung -- the fabric seemed stiff and it stuck out at the sides where the straight front seam meets the dipped back. but i ran it through a wash and dry, and it softened up and hangs much better! you have to love a polished looking skirt that you can launder with all your other clothes. i am also very pleased that although it looks bulky in the pictures here, it isn't at all, and it doesn't wrinkle - perfect for traveling light. note also that the front pl",5
Ordered two of these and they fit great and will be perfect for layering.  true to size fit.  cute detail in the back for a racer tank!,5
"I completely disagree with the previous review. i purchased this dress and i absolutely love it! i went out for a couple occasions (one being special and the other not so special) and both times i received compliments all night! my husband loves it and that really says a lot. i feel the dress runs true to size, and the quality is right where it should be... runway worthy... absolutely!.... worth $3000's + ?....probably not, but i personally can't afford that anyway. i'm so happy to have found th",5
"I am 4ft 11and 114 lbs. and i tried on the regular 0 and 2. the 2 fit  better but there was too much extra material in the back so i order the 2 petite. the 2 petite fit perfectly, very classic in the front with the right amount of flow in the back. i can't wait to wear this to work or out to dinner with the girls.",5
"I love this tunic. the fit is just lovely for me--i'm a large busted, muscular shouldered woman who wears a 4-6 on the bottom. the 8 fit perfectly across my chest (34ddd) without horrid, gaping armpits. and the gathered back gives just enough extra fabric so that the buttons do not pull at all in front--not easy to achieve in a button down for a big chested girl! i also love the cut and flow--it is fabulous and hip with skinny jeans and platform heels, but also cute with flat sandals for a day o",5
"This dress looks nothing like the photo. the sequins are dull, no sheen at all. the faux leather panels and straps look and feel like cheap, shiny plastic. i didn't even try it on, because it was so hideous, when i pulled it out of the box. not remotely worth the price and wouldn't buy it on sale for $20 either. skip.",1
"Perfect for the change in weather, this sweater is very thick and a tad big. i would say it is true to size, but if you're like me and usually order up in sweaters and outerwear, don't. there is ample room for layering underneath without being too cumbersome. the color is a bit different than that shown; it is more of a blush heather with light gray threads intertwined. just a note, the pin does not come with the sweater; the closeup made me think it did, but it really doesn't matter. the color",5
"Gals, if you absolutely must have this top wait for it to go on sale (don't worry, it will). between the poor fit and the polyester, i have no good things to report about it. this is very much below retailer's usual quality and style.",1
I ordered this for my honeymoon and it's perfect! true to size and great with cute shorts!,5
"I ordered this online which is always a gamble when it comes to fit. i was pleasantly surprised. color is true white and lace is not flimsy which i appreciate. good coverage of the girls so i don't have to layer over a tank. also arm holes don't gap and they're not too tight. beautiful with trousers, jeans or a skirt. i've already worn it twice to work. i know i'll be wearing it a lot. fit seems true to size. i usually order a medium and i ordered a medium which fits me perfectly.",5
"I just got this skirt in the mail, and i'm absolutely delighted with it. i'd ordered both my normal size and one size up, taking a tip from the reviewer who'd found it snug, but my usual retailer size fit beautifully. (i do have narrow hips, though, so maybe it's snug on more curvaceous figures?) the fabric is so soft and supple. and i've already tried the skirt with several widely varying shoe styles, so i can confirm its versatility: it looks feminine with heeled sandals (as in the pictur",5
"Adorable skirt. the eyelet part on the bottom is cut-out so see through but cute and subtle. found it fit a little snug on me- could just be my build, but i ordered it in normal size and 1 size up. the size up fit best.",5
"Beautiful blouse. i bought this in cream. runs tts. can wear with jeans, skirts etc. love front and back! very flattering arms.",5
"I love these pants! the pattern is polished and the flowy style is perfect for warm weather. i ordered a small and was worried they would be too short (i'm 5'10""), but they are just right when i wear them just slightly lower than my true waist. my new favorite summer pants.",5
Saw this tee on line and thought i'd give it a shot - the fit is very complimentary and the material is heavenly! i get lots of raves about the casual yet pretty style too. great shirt!,5
"Like another reviewer, i recently had a baby and ordered this to hide my belly. the m fits perfectly without looking too large, and the sleeves fit me just fine. i love the thicker fabric, and his is he perfect length for leggings.",5
"I am not sure why so many gave only 3 stars, yes, this top is for a strapless bra, my bra top (where the strap starts
0 was showing, but so nice... shape was ok for me, it does go in at the hem, givinng a bubble-like shape, but it's part of the charm. i dnd't experience the loose straps, but didn't pay attention to that when i tried it on. also didn't notice the stitching was red in the store, but checked, and yes, that's true... love it.

not an online exclusive, as it was in my store, i pur",5
"Like all maeve tops of this nature, i am absolutely in love! maeve always has a cute spin on an otherwise basic top. this top looks great with jeans, shorts, skirts, etc. i purchased it in all 3 colors. the blue is more of a robins egg blue, the orange is a great tangerine color (perfect for us tennessee fans!), and the ivory is a wonderful brownish-white. the ivory is my favorite because it's a very unique color.. i have a ton of white and ivory tops, but i do not have one in a color like this",5
I ordered a size 16 in the orange. it ran a size smaller than normal size 16 maeve tops. the quality of the material was terrible. it wrinkled and was also so thin that you need to wear a tank underneath. that messes with the look of the lace on the top. the color of the orange was gorgeous.,1
"Works great on my 5'11"" frame.  is pretty and feminine.  great with skinny jeans and booties!",5
Super cute and comfy. bottom of the legs have about a 8in slit that is not shown in pictures. also the hem came unraveled after the first wear. worth the money on sale! received many compliments. not see through!,5
"I've been anticipating the arrival of these pants and was literally at the doorstep with ups. i have a birthday celebration visiting wineries and thought this would be the perfect outfit.it did not disappoint. fits like a glove....very flattering and comfy! i am 5""4 and ordered a small petite. not too short, but still have the option of wearing sandals. i hesitated because of the price - but so worth it!!",5
"I wore it for the first time this week and received so many compliments. i bought the white one and it's a tiny bit see through, but still love it.",5
"Although i was worried it wouldn't live up to its sticker price, i'm glad i bought this shirt. it is extremely flattering in the way it drapes. the lace details make it seem dressy and special. the fabric feels luxurious. sleeves are almost too short for my long arms, but they are good enough.",5
"I wore this for the first time this weekend and loved it. it is long and lean but not baggy or tent like. i'm 6'0"" so i appreciate the length and fit. 
will get a lot of use out of this. good w/ skinny jeans and i can't seem to have enough black tops.",5
"Was not expecting to like this - tried on and super cute, comfy relaxed fit. looked good with leggings i had on but color will be great with jeans too. will wear both unzipped and zipped.",5
"I love the greenish option, beautiful color. the fabric super soft, and like the peek thru openings on the arms - they call it lace, but it's not really. i'm 5'9 and 140 lbs, medium was good. it is long, but it is what i wanted so works for me.",5
I love this top! it is long enough for my torso and arms. i am thinking of ordering in another color.,5
"I ordered a size large.  i recently had a baby and was looking for a top to hide my baby belly until i lose it.  this shirt fits amazingly.  i don't find the sleeves to be snug at all.  if the shirt wasn't so distinctive, i'd order in several colors.  the quality is fantastic for a tee and has a nubbed appearance you can't see in the photos.",5
"These are amazing! wide slits on out seam show off your cute shoes! runs large! i'm 5'7"", 140, size 6, hourglass. small was quite loose at waist. xs fits my actual waist and makes length right for flatter shoe <3"" heel. or small petite sits on my hips and makes length right for flatter shoe. both fit. there is ease through entire pant leg. beyond comfortable! doesn't wrinkle. looks great with the roll-neck sweater in ivory and a silver wedge shoe!",5
Excellent quality! i love this camisole with it's muted shades of black. based on other reviews i sized down from my usual 4 to a size 2 and the fit was perfect and no problems with the straps being to long. a keeper!,5
Love this hoodie. i bought a large to fit bigger on me and it works well. love the color and embroidery.,5
I saw this in the store in a display and tried it on. i got it in the sky color which is a lavender blue color. the front and back are both cute. this top can be dressed up or worn with jeans.,5
Hands down most comfortable bra ever!,5
"I have been eyeballing this shirt online. during my visit yesterday an associate just happened to bring one out for me to try on as my store had just gotten it in. happy coincidence! 

the fabric is very soft and comfortable with some give/stretch. the sleeves seem sturdy like they will hold up in the wash. i thought the shoulder area was fitted but not too snug, however i have smallish shoulders. the v neck wasn't too low (no cami needed) but low enough to be a little sexy/not dowdy. it's fai",5
"This top is lovely and flowy! it fits true to size, and the lace detail at the neck is perfect to make this top stand out. i felt like it was a little sheer, but it wasn't problematic enough for me to take away a star :-)",5
"I agree with one of the reviewers that the armholes on this dress are big; however, the garment is tight around my chest area (even though i am not chesty) and lays next to my body perfectly so this is not problematic. i don't feel like they are gaping holes, there is just more area there than i would be used to. i like the fabric this is made out of. it is not quite as soft as i had hoped, but it is comfortable. i would say it is a medium weight-a little more than i was expecting. the flare is",5
"I can't believe how much i paid for this top~got free shipping special; so worth it. i ordered the blue and i love it! size small fits perfectly. i am into peplum tops lately, they are so flattering with highwaisted jeans. i usually wear a size 4-6 in retailer.",5
Fits true to size. i am a size 4 and it fit perfectly. nice quality. fits like a glove.,5
I bought this in both yellow and green. what a gorgeous and flatttering top that fits beautifully. i love this top!,5
"I bought this dress for my college graduation, and it's truly gorgeous! i love the loose, breezy fit, but it did feel just a little bit sack-like on me, definitely more-so than i expected from looking at the product picture, even after sizing down to a small (which was comfortable, and i'm usually a medium). i ended up pairing it with a small belt. 

really pretty dress, just be advised - leaves a *lot* of room around the waist!",5
I love these pants! i ordered mine in green and retailer definitely offers vanity sizing. but i love them super cute and comfortable. i wish they had more colors available. these were a great buy!,5
"Super cute dress - swingy, flattering, easy to wear. the pattern is great, and i felt like it was the perfect length for me - though i'm short, so it may be too short for someone taller. the dress runs big. i'm usually a 6, but i got this is a 4. only complaint is that the pockets add unnecessary bulk.",5
"I have a racetrack bra that works with the arm holes (a bit large - like you see on the model), so i am not concerned about them. i may or may not have my tailor tack them in. length was good, knee length (some of retailer dresses are a tad short for my 40-yr old self). shape was flattering. i've some weight on my bum and things, even though i'm small. the back of the dress hung well, not clinging to the derriã¨re. the swing shape didn't overly accentuate my hips. i really love the dress. it's a kn",5
"I typically wear a small or x-small in most brands from retailer, but decided to order a small and medium in this dress since it's a non-stretchy fabric. i'm glad i did because the medium was a good fit and the small would have been very snug. so i would agree with the previous reviewer and say that this dress runs at least a size small. otherwise i really like the fit the fabric.",5
"Just as pictured, this little top is just too cute! the fit is exceptional, and quite flattering. another very feminine top, and the yellow color is perfect! i love pairing yellow with black, of course...but also with reds, blues...and it looks great with white 'pedal pushers'!!! i think they call them 'cropped' now a days! at any rate...this is a first rate top that i highly recommend!",5
"This is a cute dress. the quality is very good for a dress of this type. the fabric is not too thin and the stitching is perfect. i do think it runs a little small. i typically wear an xxsp or a 0p and i purchased this in the regular xs. regular xs is typically way too big, but i took a chance on this one because i really liked it and i also like my dresses a little bit longer than shown on the models. surprisingly, it fit well in the chest and the armholes were not too big, as is often the case",5
"Love this dress. the fringe makes it so special! it's a little shorter than i anticpated - it hits me right about where it shows on the model and i am 5 2"". i love the length. can't wait to wear this.",5
"Love this dress! i agree with some of the other reviewers, the arm holes are a little low but not a deal breaker. i'm 5'8"" 120lbs. and ordered the xs and it fits perfect. would definitely recommend!",5
I purchased this in black. as in the other reviews the lace detail is a little snug in the arms but it did stretch. i did not have a problem with any fraying or quality issues. the shape is very flattering. i've been asked where i bought this several times.,5
"So often you find dresses in a cool, breathable material like rayon or silk, but the manufacturer lines it in hot, non-breathable polyester. which leaves you sweating on a hot summer day (or night). thankfully, someone at antropologie knows what they're doing and this gorgeous silk dress is lined in rayon. thank you to that person.

yes, this dress is a bit on the short side. with it's modest neckline, it looks like it could be great for work, but it does hit a bit above the knee, so if you wo",5
Just received this dress and i am in love! the colors are beautiful- perfect for both summer and fall. the fabric is very soft and the fringe detail adds a nice feminine touch. i was disappointed when i missed out on the first fringe stripe shift dress from holding horses at the beginning of this summer. it was completely sold out in my size 0. however when i saw they restocked the dress in a new color (and now lined yay!) i had to buy it. would defin recommend!!,5
"This dress didn't do much for me on the hanger but it was on sale and thought i would try it on in the store. so glad i did, definitely cuter on than just hanging there. the back has a belt feature that adds a little structure. the colors are nice and bright. will be good for our hot austin summers.",5
"Very comfortable. love the built-in lining. it fits loosely, but i don't like anything binding so it works for me. length is fine, i could easily wear it to work.",5
"The shirt fits very nicely, a little large but very confortable. amazing color (i got it in green)",5
This looks beautiful and fits true-to-size. the material has enough weight so that it hangs well. this is a very form-fitting dress - i wouldn't recommend it to someone uncomfortable with a close fitting style.,5
"I love this top! although it is a tad big, i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big. however, i am still able to wear it without any nerves that it's too big.... hope that makes sense! the navy was more lovely with my skin + hair, but the yellow was so pretty too!",5
"Love the colors on this adorable, flattering style!",5
"When this dress first came out i thought it was weird.  then i started seeing people on instagram wearing outfits that look super cute and i wanted it, but sold out.  so when this version came out i snatched it up right away.   it's different from anything else i own, very quirky and in style details and has a bit of a man repeller vibe, that is why i love it.",5
"It's a casual dress with a luxurious feel. very flowy, but the back panel gives it a bit more structure. i like that it graces my body without showing any lumps. i will very much appreciate it on hot days! i'm anticipating a big of headache when ironing it, but i appreciate that it's not dry clean only. i'm on the shorter side of average height and it hits me mid-thigh.",5
"This is my first tracy reese piece, and i love it already. the somewhat edgy, unique, grommet and navy embroidery on the neckline and upper arms is very flattering on the body. the silky cotton texture surprised me; it's 60% cotton/40% viscose. it drapes well and feels good on. i will definitely enjoy wearing this for work or nice casual. i love that it is regular bra friendly. and that i don't need to stress about a low neckline. i am size 8/medium, 34f, and the medium is terrific. i got the an",5
"What attracted me to this beautiful piece is the lure of angel of the north quality and design. i know that this sweater/jacket will be worn and enjoyed this fall / winter and years to come; it's a classic beauty. when i put it on, it has a comfortable vibe, high quality, medium weight, dark black wool, and beautiful lines. i love the deep collar, slightly lower back hem, and inverted pleat at back waist to give a slight flare to the drape .it accents a feminine look and will be an invaluable st",5
"This is a great piece, it fits really well and the fabric is nice and soft. it is a good thickness so you don't have to wear a shirt underneath.",5
Looks great on. i am 5'11 and the length is perfect hits above the knee but not too short. also room in the chest area.,5
"Ok, so first things first. i'm 5'4"", 125#, 4/27, 32g and i took a small in this. it's your typical cloth/stone fabric and feel sooo good!
i do agree that this romper is on the shorter side but i liked that about it. it is far more flattering than the modeling photos online. it doesn't look that ""oversized"". i can see where taller ladies won't go for the shortness but at 5'4"" that's just not an issue for me. the bottom is very flattering and doesn't do that ""long grandma butt"" that some rompers",5
"I actually like this better on the instagram picture than on the model... anyway, i ordered the xs petite (for 115 lbs, 5'1.5"") and it fits really nicely. not too short. the material is nice and soft, nad looks like it may not wrinkles, which would be a bonus... the little gold buttons are super cute, but you can't really wear this untied, so it is pretty much a strictly tied short. sleeves are flattering... i think i may keep it :-)",5
"I tried this on in the store. the embroidery is very nice and the shirt is very flattering. however, because of all the stitching, the shirt is a bit stiff on top. there is not much give. i am also concerned that after washing it, it will look terrible, so i passed.",5
"Ok, so the shirt is ""dry clean only"", however, i like it so much that i'm not going to knock out a star in the rating. the quality is really nice and it was not too short for me ------ i could reach up without worrying my stomach would be exposed. i'm 5'6"", 36c and 125 lbs, and the size 6 was perfect. wonderful for work and also great with jeans. i know it's a little pricy, but it's cute and unique --- plus right now it's 25% cheaper.",5
"This product was very disappointing. fabric was thin, it has no shape and hangs like a pajama top. so it's not flattering at all. at $78, it's really overpriced for what it is. it might look good on someone who has the perfect body shape (what wouldn't?), but they would probably still look like they went out in their pjs. i'm 5'9"" and not well-endowed (a b), so it did nothing for me..

also, the online picture of the moss version looks like it's a grey/black combo. it's not... it is really green",1
This is a great fun dress! it's very unique and well built. my only complaint is that the colors are not the same in the photo. the real colors are black on top and a bright red with shiny torquoise thread running through it. it's still gorgeous!,5
"This top will be great in 3 seasons. i can wear it alone in summer to dress up and with a blazer or sweater in fall and winter. the velvet is beautiful and luxurious without being excessive or too much. it's very soft and comfortable on the skin, although a little larger than i expected. i ordered my usual size small and probably should have gone down a size.",5
"I ordered this online and love it. the fabric feels nice and it if fitted on the top then the bottom flows. i ordered a 4 which is my normal dress size and it fit perfect. comes a little above my knees. i'm 5'6"".",5
"I ordered this on a whim and didn't expect to like it as much as i do. it is very flattering on and seems like you could dress it up or wear it more casual. the back is all lace, in the photo she must be wearing a cami because it is see through in person. some people may be able to pull off a black bra but i am wearing a cami, which also helps with the low cut in the front. it has sort of a flirty a line shape to it, my top is a bit shorter on me than the model photo. the top is also well made,",5
"Very pleased with the fabric and design of this. it is thick, but not heavy, and the cutouts in front fall so that you don't really have to wear anything underneath (there is one cut out pretty low in the middle that i didn't initially notice, but wasn't really a problem). i'm 5""4/b cup and i bought the small but would have been better with a medium as the small kinda pulled through the chest. i couldn't wear anything over it without it pulling the whole top up. it's also a bit shorter than i th",5
Wasn't sure what to expect but i like it. ordered size large and it's a perfect fit. the color is a blush beige. it falls at the top of my hips. i don't think you need a camo under it because the holes are small. it's a sweater type knit that's substantial but not heavy.  love that it ties at the shoulder to adjust the fit and length.,5
Love this top. so soft and it fits true to size. i am a 36b and always wear a large. i am a size 12 in most tops and dresses. this top is flowy and comfortable.love the purple color. wish there was a large in blue left so i could order that too. love it!,5
"I love dark colors and i loved the summer touch to this top that i feel like i can wear it year round! the little anchors on the buttons are such a cute touch (very retailer). it does run slightly smaller, but not in an extreme way. i'd love to see more styling options for this top because i'm a little stumped at how to wear it outside of my white high waisted shorts, haha.",5
These fit around the waist but there is so much fabric and it poofs out and looks awful and bulky. no way.,1
"I tried this shirt at my local retailer and absolutely loved it ...until i read dry clean only!!!
really retailer? i know you can do better than that...",1
"This dress is amazing! love the fit, quality and design. so unique and is perfect for dressing up or down. wore it to a wedding and plan on wearing it to work. also, i'm a tall girl (5' 11"") and this dress was such a good length for me. no one likes a dress that's too short. i ordered a size 8 and it fit perfectly around the waist and chest.",5
"This is such a gorgeous tee with beautiful embroidery. the colors are exactly as shown and while i take petite sizes at 5""1, i like the length of the regular for myself. i'm 104 pounds and tried the xxs but found it to be too fitted and went with the xs in the end. i do feel that it fits tts and that is just a personal preference.",5
"I absolutely love this romper. the chambray material is super comfy and easy to wear. i ordered a size up (l ), and i'm happy i did bc it would have been a little too tight in the arm area to squeeze into and gave a little extra wiggle room in the belly area. for reference i usually wear size 8/m and i'm a 34c",5
"Picked this up yesterday in the muted teal. great shape, great color. the pink one is way brighter in person and the green, i think, is more of a forest green. each one was a little different. super cute. good price.",5
"This top immediately caught my eye in the store.  not only that, it was the pink color and i don't usually gravitate towards pink.  i live in a warm weather area so i can get good use of these tops year round.  i say tops because i bought a second top in the green a couple days later.  you can definitely see your bra when you raise your arms but this top is just so soft and breezy.",5
"This is a great every day dress. the buttons in the back make it very figure flattering, and i love the long sleeves. the fabric is light, so i'll definitely be wearing with leggings.

it's a little tight in the shoulders, which is pretty standard for this brand for me.",5
"I've been searching for wide leg trousers for what seems like years. and finally, i have found them--and on sale!!
i agree that these trousers are long for ladies of average height. i am fairly tall (5'8"") and the length is perfect for me. i don't anticipate that i will have them hemmed.
i really love the detail of the tie waist. one could wear these with or without the ribbon belt. i would say that the button closures are a bit less than substantial for the quality and weight of the fabric.
i s",5
"This dress is even better in person than in the photos online. the colors are vibrant, the material has a nice, warm weight to it, and the buttons give the whole dress that something extra to make it special. i only wish the dress came with a couple of extra buttons, as the first time i wore it one of the buttons came loose and i had to sew it back on to make sure it didn't fall off.

the dress does run a little small, i think - i normally am an extra small, but the small fit me very well.",5
I got the blue print and i love it. easy to match with any bottom really. i like that it can be made strapless.,5
"This sweater dress is very beautiful in person. the colors are very ""fall"", i actually decided against it only because i felt it was too busy for my personality. as for the fit, it runs fairly true to size, maybe slightly small. i tried on my usual medium, but i think i would have sized up for a more relaxed look. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 135 lbs, and wear a size 6. this could be quite a stunning piece on the right person!",5
The armholes on this dress are totally bizarre. i can't believe no one else has commented on them yet. i am a size s on top and m on the bottom so i usually try on both in dresses. i tend to be a small/ size 6 in retailer. the armholes are so long that the dress doesn't lay right on top. i showed it to on of the clerks in the store and she agreed with me. we looked at all the others and they were the same. going up a size made it way worse. this dress might work for someone with really broad shoul,1
"Everything about the dress is worth it. it's true the buttons are loosely sewn on, but that's easily fixed. i'm a slim person but broad in the shoulders, so i had to exchange the small for a medium because it has a narrow, fitted construction. large-chested ladies or athletic types should size up.",5
"One of the most comfortable tops i own. fits loose, such a soft fabric. looks cute. love it!",5
"Great peplum top, beautiful whine color. very thick material. i'm hourglass figure, 36d top so it was very flattering",5
"Omg i am absolutely in love with this dress, i saw it on line and knew immediately that i had to have it! i decided to go into the store to try it and it looks even better on than it did on the website. the a-line shape is very flattering and the retro pattern and colors are amazing! the only down side if there even is on is that it is a little tight across the chest but i am a 36ddd so sometimes that happens, i just took a large rather than my usual medium. other than that, this dress is my fav",5
This is a really great dress - especially for the holiday season - you can do work and post work events with it easily. i ordered a large but it fit me more like a medium. it is very comfortable and the quality feels great. boots give it the day look and a nice set of beige high heels gave it a great evening look.,5
"I think 4-5"" shorts are the best length if you want to show off your legs, but still feel comfortable running errands, and these fit the bill. they are short, but they are loose, the pattern ( i got the grey) is nice, wore them with a black top that flowed over the waistband and felt they were perfect. memorial day, wore them 2 days in a row, all day, everywhere, got lots of compliments, comfortable, washed and air dried, ready to go again. i am typically a 12, ordered the large, could probably",5
"I love this dress. colors are great, but a little tight in the chest and arms. i am 5' 8"" and usually wear a size 6. i bought the medium because i like a little looser fit on top. the arm holes are a little large which makes reaching up for things awkward.",5
"I love these pants. a dry cleaner lost my favorite black pair ten years ago. i have not used them since.
if you wait long enough, everything comes back in style. i bought black and rust. these pants are comfortable, the perfect length, can dress up or down and are very, very cute.",5
"I loved this dress as soon as i saw it online. but the price was high, and i was nervous about taking a chance on a knit dress. would it be too clingy, too stretchy, too scratchy, too...wrong? i took a chance on it after reading other reviews, and as soon as i tried it on, i knew i had found the perfect dress for winter. it is super comfortable, and the quality of the knit is very good. the material is soft and warn. the dress looks fabulous with bright tights and high boots. in the two weeks i",5
"The colors and design of this dress is stunning. i am usually a large in retailer clothes, this dress is true to size.this can be worn as a dress with boots or flats or even as a tunic. i purchased a scarf to also wear it with. this is one of my all time favorite retailer pieces!! don't hesitate.",5
"This top looks so much better on than it does in the pictures! very flattering cut and the fabric is amazingly comfortable. runs true to size, i got my normal xs.",5
"I loved the look of this dress online, so i was excited to order it, but when it arrived i found it was not at all how i expected it to be. i thought the material would be more lacy, but it seemed pretty cheap. there was also some boning at the waist which is nice in theory, but it made the material poof out just under the waist, making me look like i had a belly. no matter what i did i could not get it to lay flat. returned to the store and bought the embroidered perennial dress instead, which",1
These pants are beautiful. the color is a nice deep red. pretty color for fall and the wide legs are very complimentary for athletic thigh women like myself. my only regret is listening to the other reviewer. these pants run true to size. i am normally a 0p in elevenses and should of stayed with that but went for a 00 because of the review claiming they run small. the waist is accurate sizing. the only thing running big on these pants are the width of the legs and that should be expected from th,5
"Knitted & knotted are my new bff. their sweater dresses are amazing and i'm now tracking down sold out versions of their apparel to enhance my closet and have a party. i adore (and drool...just a lil bit) this dress. the colors and styling and warmth make me happy. i sized up to a l because of my linebacker shoulders/broad bust (thanks retailer user reviewers!) i am comfy as long as i don't flail or flap. my one teeny tiny little complaint is right out of the factory cellophane bag, i had a loose",5
"I love this dress. i was afraid it would be too long because it said petite was 56"" but it was perfect. i am 5'0 and ordered the size xsp and the length is perfect. however, in the picture the lining is shorter than the outer layer, but on my dress the lining in longer than the dress in some areas. the dress is very modest in the front and the back has a nice plunge but not too low.",5
Great tank! i really like the black and white striped one! very versatile .,5
"For me, this skirt runs a little large. my waist is smaller than my hips so i was able to order a small, which fits perfectly. i'm 5'5"" and the length hits at the right spot, too, so there is no need for hemming. i have yet to wear the skirt, but i anticipate that it will be a great piece to transition from summer to fall with an easy switch of the shirt and shoes. can't wait to get a lot of use out of this one!",5
"Great maxi skirt that flows as you walk.  i can see myself wearing this year round.  i'm 5'7"" and it's still pretty long on me.  i would have gotten the petite if it were available.  i usually wear a 10 or 12 in pants and the medium skirt was perfect for me.  so you may want to size down unless you have bigger hips.    i'm not usually a fan of the drawstring waist but this one doesn't add bulk like most do.   overall great skirt!",5
"This is a great summer staple tank! i first ordered it in black + white, and i'm now ordering the coral + navy. i'm usually a petite xs (i have a short torso), but seeing the length on this tank, i went with the regular and glad i did. also, i had previously bought the filigree lace tank (same brand), and the length of the petite on that tank is the same as this tank's regular length, so i knew it'd fit perfectly.",5
"I so wanted this skirt to work, love the design! but, it's way, way too long... i am 5, 5, 116lb, and the small is 1 inch on the floor. i step on the skirt as i walk.",1
I found my experience odering the moon lake maxi skirt very easy. i received the skirt in a timely manner and am very happy with my purchase.,5
These are a comfortable and fashionable pair of shorts!  they run true to size and look great!,5
This tank was much needed for my wardrobe. i love the vivid colors and forgiving cut. i am 130lbs and purchased an xs .,5
"I love this tunic, i wore it with black leggings and boots. it is well made and flowy. i wish it came in more colors.",5
Love these shorts! fit true to size and the material is so amazing.,5
This cardigan is so fun to wear. you can wear it like as it is shown on this model or turn bottom up and wear upside down as tag suggestion.,5
"I've been eyeing this piece for a while and gave in when there was a sale. admittedly, i was first drawn away when i read that it was a pull on style, which always seemed cheap to me; however, it worked in my favor since the small was a tad big but the draw string helped cinch it (the store currently didn't have xs). the skirt, as shown on the model, seems like it'll be great as a transitional piece for autumn and winter (and when i tried it in the fitting room, i paired it with a cardigan and a",5
"Around 5 years ago, i bought 4 pairs of ""daughters of the liberation"" brand (very similar style) shorts at retailer, and have been repairing any and all frayed fabric in the first two pair, in a lighter material than the second two pair, ever since, in order to preserve my #1 favorite shorts. thank goodness pilcro - another longtime fave brand of pants available at retailer - came through this year with these very similar, but perhaps even nicer, shorts. i bought the yellow striped pai",5
"I love these. the white actually has a more pronounced look between the top and bottom with a little but of shading. since they look a bit different because of that i got both white and black. perfect wait and not to giant, and perfect for year round work. the shawl color is a tad flimsy in how it sits but overall these are fabulous.",5
This is adorable!  lots of compliments on color.  great fit!,5
"Besides the beautiful print, i found the fit to be extremely flattering. i'm typically a medium, but the small was a better fit. this dress hangs beautifully and the unusual waist ""band"" gives the dress (and me) a great shape. i felt so wonderful wearing this dress!",5
"I feel both confident and comfortable in this dress. it runs true to size, though maybe just a little bit large. i enjoyed wearing it from the get-go!",5
I just bought these shorts in the gold color. the fit is just right and the material / quality matches up to the price you pay. totally worth every penny.,5
"This dress hits all of the high notes for me. it is crisp, elegant, and it looks like something a european coutour designer would create. i am so glad i have this dress in my wrardrobe. it hits me just above the knee which is super flattering. wear this to a fancy party when you want to look feminine and classy. it is a dress that will serve you for a lifetime.",5
"Really love the pattern and color combination. the dress has an attached lining to around the knee. i would say this is tts or a little big. i'm 5'8"" and around 135 and size s fits well with a bit of extra room around the waist. print and fabric cover any perceived flaws and create a long, lean look. i love the feeling of effortlessness--with cute sandals this is an outfit.",5
I'm returning this cardigan. it doesn't fit me at all. it's shapeless and loose.,1
I love the cut and style of this simple striped tank! it's good fabric,5
"These pants are uh-mazing!! i love that they have a seam in the front of the leg and in the back of the leg. i didn't notice it in the photo online but in person it stands out more and anything vertical on my petite frame is a+. way to go! these are my new favorite pants...i wish pilcro would make this style in more colors, and fabrics. 

i wear a 25p or a 24p and i'm glad i got the 25p because it's true these are tight in the leg but i think that's a good thing since cords look awful when the",5
Cute everyday shorts. run tts to maybe just slightly small. not too short for this mid 30s mom.,5
"Gorgeous top/tunic. runs true to size. i paired it with jeans, but i love the look of the white pants in the picture. beautiful and flows nicely.",5
Love this t-shirt....i will be wearing this until it wears out. very soft; great fit; and very comfortable....,5
"Love this skirt. i wore it to work after purchasing this, and i had at least 20+ people comment on how beautiful it is. many office ladies asked where i purchased it and one (who asked the cost) said it was worth the steep price. the green in this skirt really pops out, as do the gorgeous golden flowers. the pockets are a nice addition as well.",5
"I'm going through a blouse phase, and this was exactly what i wanted. i'm not svelte, and blouses rarely hang off my frame in a flowy flattering manner, but this one is perfect! it is just loose enough and just form accentuating enough that it looks amazing! i am petite with broad shoulders and a large ribcage/short torso, so flowy is a tough one for me.",5
"I was very excited about this dress having seen someone where it on the street months ago. i got my usual size 6 and could not button it up for the life of me. i get it, i'm busty and sometimes button downs are a tricky. however, the arms were impossibly tight. my boyfriend starting cracking up when he saw my arms busting out of the sleeves.",1
Very flattering suit. embroidery is unique and the cut flatters.,5
"I love the design on this top. it's a little thin, but it's held up great with a few washes.",5
"Completely in love with this dress! i'm a huge fan of byron lars, and this one by far is my favorite. everything about this dress is perfect. it's very well made too. i usually wear a size 4, but kept the size 6 instead. the waist felt a bit too tight with the 4. btw: the belt is adjustable.",5
This blouse is a disappointment . fabric is cheap looking and the cut is very off. just odd. sleeves awkward . the back of the white shirt on the on-line model is not the same as the white shirt i received. mine was plain in the back like the blue shirt on line even though my shirt was white. no ruffle. returned.,1
"Very flattering suit. runs large. i stumbled into this in my local store. must have been a return. i tried it on even though it was a size small not my usual medium. fit like a glove!! covered my 36c chest. i have tried many suits and this is best on my curvy shape. flattering to tummy. i am 5'6"" 127lb.  not very toned at 59 years of age. this suit is amazing. highly recommend!!!!",5
"Fun pattern, great colors and super comfy and versatile! great pickup at the sale price!",5
This dress is like a piece of art. absolutely beautiful on. i wore it to a charity event and received several compliments. it's just so gorgeously different!,5
"I ordered the skirt on friday and it arrived on monday. my expectations were exceeded. the fabric is great quality and there are subtle flecks of gold throughout. the fabric is substantial but not stiff at all - for this type of skirt, you need a thicker fabric. i'm about 5'4"", 123lbs and i ordered a 2 regular. the fit - everything from the length to how it fell on the hips, is perfect. can't wait to wear this skirt!",5
Love love this skirt! such a pretty green color and a great quality. this will be a staple in my closet for years to come. and i love a skirt with pockets.,5
"Bought this dress for easter and the compliments were relentless. the quality of this is superior, hence the price. the fact that it can be worn year round, i will get my money's worth out of it. my only ""complaint"" is the belt. that little sucker was way confusing to me so i just went without it. i needed directions to figure it out or a phd. ; )",5
"Soft fabric, the blue is a nice color, rich. the drape effect is very flattering on the body. the length of the regular xs was fine on me, i often get petite but would not need it in this case. could wear this with jeans or dress it up with a nice skirt. good basic.",5
"The skirt looked orange online, but is more of a nice red (i do like orange too though).
i had orginially palced this in my basket as a to order later to see, but my store had it. glad because i would have ordered petite, adn i do think that would have been too short for me (not appropirate for work or (in my opinion0, my age). the skirt (size 0 regular), fit my waste, and fell about one inch above my knee. i am 5'1.5"" (115 lbs if it helps#... so petite would have been short.

the only thing tha",5
"So i ordered this because i like amadi dreses in general, and was curious how hte long one would fit. i do love it, it is really comfortable. color is pretty neitral, material is thick enough for fall, california winters and cold spring days. can be dressed up a little with nice heeled booties. i am less than 5'2"" (115 lbs if curious# and this worked on me #petite, xs). i say go for it!",5
"I fell in love with this skirt at the store, but was concerned i wouldn't have enough to wear with it. i ended up purchasing it online and when it arrived found that it goes with so many things. black turtleneck as pictured, navy blue blouse with bird print, white t-shirt, white blouse, the options are endless. fits true to size. too short to wear to work but will be perfect for spring and summer weekends. can't wait for the weather to warm up.",5
I agree with the other reviewers. this shirt is cuter in person. it is a flattering cut and the design is even prettier than in the photos. the color is more navy--not the charcoal color it looks in the photos. the stitching is also more colorful in real life.,5
"Just got this in a 2 petite (5'4"" 120lbs 34b) and it fits perfectly. the length is right at the bottom of the knee. it is fitted tight at the waist and the belt is even more beautiful in person. this dress has some weight and the quality seems excellent. there is a scalloped nude lining that is attached to the dress and the dress can be unzipped from the bottom as well.
there is a darker lace fabric under the armpit which i like since it hides your armpits much better than the sheer red lace fab",5
This dress is absolutely stunning and well made. it can be worn throughout the seasons. i love this designer and this dress is a masterpiece.,5
"These pants are gorgeous! they are not a denim material, more like the softest khakis you've ever felt. they're very flattering and hug all the right places. i am a 4-6 in pants and the 27 feels great. a worthy investment!",5
"Yes, as much as i'd have liked this to be a true red, it's kind of red-orange; i am relieved, however that it is not as orange as it looks on my monitor! that is my only slight-and i mean slight-disappointment in this cute-as-all-get-out skirt! i am 5""5"" 140 lbs and the six is perfect, leading me to believe that this is tts. it is a polyester mix with a same-color liner, large buttons followed by smaller, silver colored buttons at the apron. the larger buttonholes are red and white striped and t",5
This dress is stunning! the quality is impeccable and the craftsmanship is stunning. i ordered my typical size and it was snug but sizing up would not have worked. this may be the most beautiful high quality piece i've ever seen at retailer!,5
"I ordered a medium, as i like my shirts a bit loose. it is a beautiful shirt, and looks great in person. however, this shirt is cut more wide and short than it is long and lean. exchanged for a small!",5
"It took a minute, but once i figured out how to wear this, i loved it. it is meant to be oversized, and for me looks best with leggings and ankle boots (too much bulk to be worn with even a slim skirt). i'm 5'9"", curvy and long limbed. the fabric has a thick, high quality feel; i find it quite soft and comfy. the unexpected design of the ribbing gives it a subtle chic; it's fashion forward without trying too hard. the ""cowl"" is really closer to a boatneck with an extra fold, which works well for",5
Ag jeans have been a main stay for me. they are the most comfortable and best looking jeans on my body. however this pair was too tight and shorter then i liked. the fabric and color is beautiful. i wear the same size for ag no matter the design. but this one ran too small. i have to return it. i will try the next size up if they still have them.,1
This skirt is a keeper. great quality. beautiful color. great fit!,5
The colors in this skirt are gorgeous. a super pretty emerald/green color with graphic silver and black flowers. this skirt can be dressed up or dressed down. i'm loving the idea of wearing black tights and flat boots with it to make it casual or wearing it with tights and heels for a holiday party. the weight of the skirt isn't heavy so i think with the right colors can wear it in spring too.,5
"Versatile and flattering. i don't order many clothes online because i'm a tough fit and need to try on first, but this was one of the rare times it was worth the risk. i love the high waisted, vintage style and the length is perfect. the bold color is fun. the little details are even better- navy blue piping, the buttons and the ribbon laced on the back. great skirt.",5
"Currently wearing right now :)
purchased during the first days of the tag sale. runs large (i.e. i typically wear m-l, and ended up going with a small!). definitely need a tank underneath, as the hook does not close the top of fully. like the blue color; the pink is more of a peach and made me look incredibly washed out.
a must at the tag sale price!",5
"I love this skirt! i feel in love with it in-store and when i couldn't stop thinking about it a few weeks later i knew i had to get it. beautifully made with high quality materials and so flattering! fits very well for my figure (big butt and hips w small waist, sits just below my belly button and accentuates my waist and slims my hips. must have!",5
"This t-shirt is great! it fits really well and is very flattering. the colors are nice, including the t-shirt color itself. the fit is perfect, including the sleeves. and it's very comfortable. my only concern is how well it will do after you wash it a few times.",5
"This arrived in white at my store and it was so airy and dreamy i had to try it on. this is the epitome of the effortless tank. its a simple throw on with enough style that all it needs is your favorite pair of jeans and a cute necklace. unfortunately it didn't quite work for me. if you have any kind of tummy or chest, size up. i tried on my typical large but it was too tight and ended up looking like a maternity shirt on me. however, my coworker who is much more of a slimmer shape tried this on",5
"This skirt is absolutely beautiful and is a gorgeous vintage red which is more pigmented than i'm used to in my closet, but that's not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. it runs a little large in the waist. also, the skirt comes up higher on the torso than pictured. mine comes up to slightly above my waistline and ends at about mid thigh. however, i love this skirt and its timeless design assures me it will stay in my wardrobe for years to come.",5
"Not sure who this is for but its not for me. skirt was long, stiff and puffy on my hips. i could not get it to lie correctly. maybe you have to be 6' to pull this off...",1
I absolutely love this skirt! the picture does not do it justice. it is absolutely beautiful and fits perfectly. i received so many compliments when i wore it!,5
"Nice modern print, vibrant colors, and not sheer (no need to add an extra layer which is nice for those of us who run hot!)",5

"I went with my instincts and grabbed a size l as opposed to my usual medium.  fits great and flatters the girls while hiding my meaty back!  such a great artistic design, i will love wearing it this weekend.  i am scared to wash it, i may just have to dip it in lingerie powder and drip dry.  for fit reference: 140#, 36dd, i hold my weight in my neck, shoulders, back, upper arms, tummy (i'm not a gorilla.)",5
"Very disappointed the back of this blouse is plain, not as displayed.",1

This skirt is beautiful! the green really pops and makes the skirt stand out. it runs true to size. definitely a great addition to your wardrobe.,5
"I honestly, have to give these jeans 5stars.  i loved them when i saw them in the store and had to have them and when i wore them, i got tons of compliments. they are super comfortable too!  i read some of the other reviews and thought that their comments were a little strange.  these jeans are obviously not classic and they will go of style but, if you run a little outside of the style box you will welcome them in your wardrobe.",5

Omg!! i just received this dress and it is absolutely gorgeous!! fits me like a glove. lovely rich reds and quality..... for reference i'm 5'2 and 99 lb and the 00 petite was perfect i could have even gone with the 00 regular. if it's within your means i highly recommend. :d,5
"This tank i am in love with. the color is great to go with jeans or any color i have in my wardrobe. it works with skinny jeans, culottes or a skirt and perfectly compliments the current shoe styles. my gladiators, summer booties, and my espadrilles are all equally cute with this outfit topper. it is made out of the most beautiful lightweight material and will be great for the 100 degree plus summers that we have here in texas. the bra thing is a bit of a problem because a strapless bra dose not",5
Really cute and comfy and casual skirt. i am looking forward to travelling in this skirt and running around for the summer. i did size down one size. highly recommend. will get lots of wear.,5
"I bought this cute ruffled tank in ivory to go with a silk wrap skirt i've had. it arrived today and it fits perfect. i am 5'5"", 125 lbs and small busted 34b. i bought size small after reading the reviews and glad i did because it fits perfect. the straps are not too long (a common problem for me), it's a nice length, nipped a bit a bit at the waist with slight flare below. also it does not gap under the arms which is much appreciated. a lot of thought went into this little top. i can wear it to",5
"These shorts are a must. they are so soft and go with every top imaginable. i bought these in an xs and feel they run tts. for reference i am 5'1"" and normally wear a 24,25, or 0. you will not regret this purchase.",5
"Bought the blue romper and love it to bits! definitely a summer staple. i'm 5'4"", 105 lbs and generally consider myself proportioned, but curvy on the bottom, and the xs fit perfectly. many rompers have really short inseams, but this one is a relatively conservative 4-5"" so i feel comfortable and can dress it up or down. i've worn it a few times and received tons of compliments. it's super comfortable, forgiving, and flattering. i originally purchased it in black in pxs and ps, because at the ti",5
"The fit on this is so strange. the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift. the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price. the cups are padded, which is nice i suppose, but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i'm guessing. i'm a 32dd, size 8 in pants, and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium. i also have a long torso, which probably didn't help.",1
"Love, love, love. like another chambray item i have, they feel stuff and rough after washing, but once you put them on, they soften up and look great.",5
"I love unstructured pull on dresses in the summer and this maeve is better than photo. i wear a medium and fit is spot on. i also purchased the earlier version of this dress, same style and maker, different pattern and have gotten a lot of wear out of it this past summer. i expected this dress to be identical, but it's even better, it's fully lined and is a slightly different and more substantial fabric.
and did i mention pockets! i plan to wear it into the fall with a short cardi to dress it u",5
I purchased this dress in 4 colors...beautiful and so comfortable. highly recommend,5
"Love this dress! runs big though, size down",5
Love this! i sized up to xl from large.. great pattern. very soft. i am thick legged and big booty. this romper is the perfect length. the only issue is when i need to use the bathroom. hard to unzip from the back in a hurry. i had my husband unzip for me in order to pull down.,5
Love the dress. runs a little big. i ordered a size down than i normally wear and it fit. versatile too--i even wore it to the office with a black blazer over it and got lots of compliments!,5
"I love an item of clothing that i am able to justify its purchase by knowing it is unlike any other piece in my closet. this skirt definitely fits that desire.the material looks almost like the colors were ""felted"" onto the dark background creating a wearable art piece! very vibrant colors. the material itself is somewhat stiff and maintains its structure when on. i needed to wear a size 6 (i'm sometimes a 4; sometimes a 6 with a waist measurement of 28"") and the skirt sits at the smallest part",5
"This sweater/coat is great. it super comfortable. it's perfect for my california winters! it could be layered for colder areas. this piece definitely runs large- like really large. i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium. it is meant to be boxy, and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering. i'd definitely say go in store and try it on, you'll love it!",5
"I'm pear-shaped so my inclination is to always grab an a-line/fit-n-flare style dress or skirt. but for some reason this stood out to me and i'm glad i tried it on. i love this dress! i'm 5'9 with a longer torso and this still went down to my knees so it definitely works for taller girls. the cut is so flattering and, along with the thicker material, it gives me more of an hourglass shape that enhances my curves instead of making me want to camouflage them. i got my dress in a size 6 and it's tt",5
"I recommend this dress for women wth a small bust. this is an absolutely gorgeous dress, but it runs very small through the bodice and is almost empire waisted. if you remember the coral dress from spring by the same designer, it fits the same but this one has a tiered skirt. so sad- i love this dress-the colors and design are beautiful.",5
"I ordered the cream. the fabric is unique. similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality. you definitely need a cami or tank underneath. its form fitting without being too snug. i like to wear it with distressed jeans, front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle, (my trouble spot) with chunky accessories, belt, necklace and a block heel. it's a little pricey but decided worth it.",5
I didn't realize that the grey sleeves are attached (i assumed that was just an undershirt on the model). needless to say it looks cheap and poorly made. will be returning,1
First thing i would say these pants run large i'm a size 6 the size 4 fit perfect i love the style and look of the cascade fabric on leg of these pants but these pants are a little heavy still a beautiful pant,5
"Contrary to the first review, i find this top to be gorgeous. the fabric has a silkiness to it (with a slightly heavier weight). the lace thru neckline is beautifully done (the eyelets are high-quality). the fit has flow, like on the model, but still a bit of shape (not the formless fit that some blouses like this have). i love the open sleeves. i am 5' 8"" 120lbs 34b and am happy with the xs.",5
A finely laced sheer bustier along with a gown split along the sides makes for a lovely sleeping garment. the material is cooling and the lace is not itchy.,5
"I ordered this in the peach color and it is a beautiful pale color. the underside of the cuff has a pretty pattern on it, so if you roll it up once it adds a little something extra! it is extremely see through though so you might want to wear a tank under!",5
"This dress is beautiful! 
i am on the short side so i ordered in regular and petite and due to the length the petite is better. 
the material is soft and comfortable to wear.",5
"There'd a reason this dress is all over instagram and like. it's stunning and beautiful, perfect for a wedding or event. the beading is beautiful and the tiers on the dress are more flattering than you'd expect , especially since it does have a bit of pouff to it. love it, 5 stats! i sized up so that it would be longer",5
"This dress is way prettier in person than online. fits like a glove. a little tight up top as are most side zips. i did not have to size up, however.",5
"Lovelier in person! fit tts; i tried this on, walked away without it and returned to my store to purchase because i couldn't stop thinking about this dress. most definitely can be worn now, but will layer well through the winter - dress it up with heels and accessories or make it casual with a denim jacket and booties :) perfect floor length at 5'3.5"" in the regular 0; tiny bit of room in the bust for a 32b",5
"1. i'm 5'5"" tall, 145 lbs, and 38 (36d) -32-40, and a solid size 10. the size 10 fit me perfectly, but if it shrank it would be too tight across the bust. the size 12 also fit me well but was an inch looser all around. the darts on the 12 hit me in exactly the right place, so i decided to go with the 12, even though it looks a little big. it makes me look smaller.

2. the fabric is a soft ivory color, and the fabric is soft but thick. it's not see through at all. 

3. the lace on the sides a",5
"I'm 5 ft 3 inches, 130 lbs. this dress fits perfect! i bought a 4r. the petite 4 probably would have fit and been a inch or two shorter but i don't the regular looked bad. it hits an inch or two below my knee. medium thickness of fabric is forgiving even though the dress hugs in all the right places. beautiful dress!!",5
"I love this sports bra. i do various exercises and it works great for all of them from yoga to running. the floral pattern is what really drew me to get this, but the quality of this bra is the best i've ever gotten. i wear a 34b bra and the medium fits perfect!!",5
"This is a really nice dress for the money. i definitely had to size down. i've always taken a 4 in hd in paris tops, so i initially ordered a 4. but it was a little too big in the chest area. (i wear a 32dd so normally this isn't my issue.) i replaced it with a 2 and it fits great. i also have a long torso, which can be an issue for me with dresses. but this one works on me! this is definitely a good dress for taller girls. the material is high quality too. i'm going to wear it to my friend's we",5
"I knew i had a winner when my husband said ""cute top"" the first time i put this on. the style, quality and sizing are all excellent. i love the lace detailing in addition to the open shoulder style. i am always looking for long sleeve tops that go great with jeans and are right on trend. this a great addition to my all wardrobe.",5
"I love this gown so much, i would wear it everyday if i could. it is cozy, beautiful, and feels special like an heirloom. the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft. color is much prettier than the photo picks up!!! i love this gown. my favorite, hands down.",5
"I tried this blouse on and loved the style, comfort and color of the peach so much that i was preparing to buy it. when i pulled the sleeve the fabric came away from the cuff. i tested another spot pulling only gently and the same thing happened. too bad since the color would have been a great addition for me. 

but--i also tried the blue and it gets 4 stars, as the fabric is much better. it too is adorable, soft and did not tear on gentle testing. the two blouse colors are made from different",1
Oh i simply can't say enough about this dress... it's just so pretty! i've sometimes had trouble with beaded pieces from retailer but not this dress. it's a very flattering piece and the material is comfortable and soft. really flattering. you can dress it up or down as well - i'm glad i'll be able to wear this into fall with a leather jacket.,5
"Just had to review this dress because it is so beautiful. the fabric is light and soft, and is really perfect for this flowy tiered design. the colors are really pretty, not too bright, and it fit perfectly. i would say that it is much more dressy than it appeared in photos. the bodice has some beading, and it was much longer on me than on the model, though still a perfect maxi length. it would be perfect to wear to a wedding or formal affair.",5
This skirt has no closure along the slit. i can't begin to understand how it could be worn as shown in the photo-you would be completely exposed. it completely baffled me,1
Love this coat! super soft and cozy!! did not realize the sleeves are built in to the jacket. wasn't too excited at first but once i tried it on i fell in love. great quality!,5
"Lovely colors and print. my problem with this dress was that the bust was on the smaller side (it will fit those with a smaller chest nicely!), and worse, the beading on the bodice was attached with black thread, which showed through the sheer netting layer on top. 

for the price, this particular detail should have been addressed.",1
"The design of this shirt is stunning. i can't even tell you how many people complimented me on the shirt. the only thing is it does run a bit long. with it being long, it can go nicely with leggings and boots.

material is a bit thin and should be hand-washed or dry cleaned. i do wish there were more sizes in petite.",5
"This dress is so flattering! i absolutely love it! it hides a multitude of flaws. the sleeves are just the perfect length for me, as is the length of the hem. the waist also sits right where i want it in the regular sizes. the material is comfortable and has a little give to be a little clingy on top but flares perfectly on the bottom not too far out that it makes your bottom half look huge. just perfect!",5
"It's hard to tell how you will like this top unless you try it on first. 1. yes, it runs big and wide but not long, which i like. 2. yes it it is fairly sheer, but the design allows for a fitted tank. 3. i found it adorable once those first two issues were corrected. it's a cute late summer top, easy breathing for humidity. 
i like this top as well because it allows for a normal bra strap, so you feel covered but the sexy shoulders peek out. it also is a bit longer in the back than the front wh",5
"After seeing how this looked on model in the picture i had a feeling it might be not only a bit short but also high waisted. so i took a chance and ordered a regular size 2. i am 5'1 115lbs, so i typically order a petite 2. received this today and am very happy i made that choice. the waistline hits where it should and the skirt hit right at my knees. the fabric is perfect for winter. i was actually surprised at the weight of the dress when i pulled it from the box - it was very heavy. the lace",5
"This looks great with the pilcro lace bottom white jeans. i bought the yellow and blue and it is flattering on. longer in the back. i love the style of the sleeves. very flattering style and fun, flirty and feminine. slightly see through. depending on your modesty level a nude bra may be just fine or else a nude cami. a really fresh look for summer. i do not think it looks cheap. i do think it is overpriced but i have a hard time finding tops that hit me at the right length in front and are not",5
"I just received this in my normal petite xs and it fits perfectly! it's gorgeous in person, and i know this will be one of my most worn tops this summer.",5
"This is probably my current favorite dress. it is beautiful, comfortable, and flattering. i wear it with swept up hair and delicate earnings.",5
Beautiful overlay runs large had to return for a smaller size,5
"This is the sort of top i love to find at retailer. it's versatile because the fabric is comfortable enough to wear everyday and the lace gives it a dressy, feminine feel. i love the navy because the white behind it shows up the lace beautifully. the yellow behind the white is also very pretty. it's fuller than it looks in the product shots. even in an xxs, it's long on me at 5'4"" but it's fine. not sure i can wear with shorts because of the length but good with a mini. the neck is also a little h",5
This dress is everything i wanted it to be. i bought it to wear to a winter wedding and the material is perfect for that! i initially ordered it in a 0 regular and ended up having to exchange it for a 0 petite and it fits absolutely perfectly! the detailing on the shoulder is beautiful.,5
I am obsessed with the quality of the fabric on this top. i am giving it as a gift and can't wait!!!!,5
This blouse is wonderful. i just got and wore the wine colored blouse today. i received so many compliments. i love it and with the sale price it is so worth it.,5
"The material is very soft and the lace has a beautiful design. it looks very elegant and romantic. you will need a racer back bra to wear with it though, because of the design of the straps. it is very flowing and i think the cut is flattering. the material in the back is slightly transparent so you might want to wear a tank underneath. overall, very pretty and i would highly recommend. (i purchased the white and yellow version.)",5
"Such an easy to wear and nicely cut summer dress. it does not wrinkle, has pretty colors and fits very well. i haven't washed it yet, but i like the idea that it can be machine washed. highly recommend. the fabric is good quality, a little bit thick for hot days though.",5
"To sum up my review at the beginning: i walked out to my best friend and two retailer employees and all 3 of them stopped and said, ""whoa."" it's an understated stunner.
i tried this dress on a whim: and boy am i glad i did. i'm 5'4"", 140lb, 34b with weight carried on the bottom, usually wear a size 4 in fit and flare dresses: the size 2 fit like a glove here.
i'm shocked at just how incredible the lace is: thick, well laid on the base dress fabric, gorgeous without being too 'lacy'. the base fabri",5
"I purchased this dress in our retailer store. i usually wear either a 0 or 2 petite (5'1"", 115 lbs.). i was able to wear a 0r in this and it fit perfectly. i paired it with a sparkly belt from retailer for a cocktail party and received lots of compliments.",5
"I got this top in a petite xs and it fit just as expected (i'm 5'2"", 112lbs). the material wears like a tee, so it's comfortable, but the front details give it a special look. this is going to be on my go-to list all summer.",5
This shirt is even prettier in person. it's really flowy but still very flattering.,5
"Love this shirt- i got the white/yellow one and with a pair of dark jeans and booties i was ready for anything. i have an hourglass type figure, and sometimes with flowy shirts that is hidden. but this shirt somehow subtly emphasized that in an attractive way!",5
"I would suggest trying this on in store. the xs would've worked (that's my normal size), but i ended up preferring the s. it does have low armholes. the s in the yellow was just right for me, but the s in the navy was too low in the armholes and the shirt was cut a little crooked. still, a very cute and classic top that i know i'll get a lot of use out of.",5
"I really love this top! fits true to size, romantic lace detail. also love the white underlay panel for contrast. extremely comfortable soft fabric. so many ways to dress this top up or down.",5
I bought this cuz i wanted a plaid shirt that didnt have too much plaid..this is true to size and adorable! i will be wearing it out and not to bed or for lounge. adorable detailing on back and on shoulders...its a keeper!,5
"I ordered these twice just to be sure there wasn't a glitch. the color is so off! the picture shows a dark blue denim, but they are not they are a light blue - with whiskering! retailer you need to have a better image of the color because this is so misleading.",1
"I picked this dress up in a size 8 - fits tts. i have a 34dd chest; 145 lbs. and 5 ft. 4 inches in height. i have an hourglass figure and the size 10 was too big and the 8 fit just right. the skirt is lined and the upper bodice part is not, it says on the tag hand wash which is a plus because dry cleaning is not a plus. hits me just about 2 inches above the knee. the thick lace detailing is very special and price point with the dress promo made me feel this would be a great dress for the holiday",5
"Beautiful, well made and styled dress. perfect for company christmas parties where you want to look nice but not show too much cleavage. i wear it with a cameo brooch.",5
This top is the epitome of late summer and getting into fall mood. it's soft fabric falls nicely on top of skinny jeans. the open shoulders are trendy and flattering!,5
"Love this top. tried it on in the store and had to have it. did not find it too sheer and could wear my regular bra with it, as the shoulders fit where the straps are. got tons of compliments on it. would have bought in more colors if offered i loved it that much. the perfect bohemian hippie chic top, if there is such a style!",5
Fight a bit snug over the bust then widens like a bell. not as cute as it looks in the photo. returned.,1
This is a great easy to wear summer dress. a denim jacket would look adorable to wear on a cooler night. it runs a bit small in the waist and i bought the petite because i wanted it to be above the knee summer casual. it is very flattering because of the pattern detail by the waist. it is the perfect summer dress and best of all it is machine washable!,5
Love this top. the beautiful and delicate details are wonderful. the cut is a loose fit which is great. it works with tailored trousers and jeans,5
"I love this top! shows off the shoulders but a normal bra works. no tank needed. not too boxy looking, all these things i have had a problem in some of the currant tops an retailer. i felt it was flattering and comfortable with some country chic. i found the colors to be a bit more rich than online. there was a tiny bit of puffy fabric around the back upper shoulder, but nothing to worry about. the neckline is a stretchy and close fitting, and that's the part of the top that i don't usually wear i",5
"I love this top. i bought it in the blue but loved all the colors. i fell in love with it on-line and hesitated ordering it only because i was afraid that the arm holes would be too large (based on what i saw in the picture). fortunately they had it at my local retailer, so i was able to try it on. my usual xs fit perfectly. great flow, soft and casual. perfect for those cool nights in the summer or layered with a cardigan in the winter.",5
Love the colors of this dress. it did run a little large. i ordered a large and medium and went with the medium.,5
"36dd, 10/12 in tops, 12/14 in bottoms

this tank is amazing! the flowing a-line shape is very flattering. the armholes are perfect - all too often i see a good tank top ruined by large, gaping armholes. no bra peek-a-boo here! fabric is a stretch micro-rib knit that doesn't cling too tightly, just enough to give the top good definition. i took the size large for the length - just past the hips on me. the side slits keep the look flowy. the light blue contrast color is light grey, while the brigh",5
"I purchased this in the blue motif.  i am 5'4, 118 pounds and got an xs. i love everything about this tee. it looks great with jeans and i love it with my white denim shorts! i haven't worn it off the shoulder yet.  i think it looks great as a regular tee. i get compliments whenever i wear it.  so happy with this purchase!",5
"This is such a cool military jacket. when i saw it displayed on a table at my local retailer, i knew it was going home with me. this is my 4th marrakech jacket, i love their style. i bought the black in my usual size large, and i agree with the previous reviewer, if you have a chest this is a very flattering jacket. i usually wear my jackets open, and i discovered that if you button back the lapels at the second button down it looks amazing and not so sloppy. it kind of bothered me the way",5
"I am normally not a vest person, however i saw this and had to try it. it is awesome and on sale. i am 5' 3"" and 128 pounds and the small fit perfectly.",5
"Love, love, love this jacket! i'm able to dress it up or casual. the hint from a review i read to button the lapels back worked awesome. good quality, has a bit of stretch for bulky shirt to wear underneath. would definitely recommend if like the military jacket style.",5
"I am so glad that i got this one.i wish i got the bigger size,but got it on sale.i am glad,that i have it for next winter.",5
I'm obsessed with this top. i actually love that the sides are a bit higher than the front and back. i feel like that gives it shape. i bought jeans similar to the pic here and they look so good together. love!,5
Saw this top online and hoped for the best. my hopes were rewarded! lovely lightweight summery top but i think with a cardigan it could be worn in the fall also. i asked 4 friends if they liked it and they all agreed it was very flattering so i decided it was a keeper. have worn it three times since purchasing and have received lots of compliments.,5
I ordered a med petite. usually this fits but this shirt was long and the sleeves wouldnt stay down. as a regular shirt it was not cute.,1
I love this jacket. it's easy to dress up or be casual. the black is more like a very dark grey.,5
"I am in love with this bathing suit. it is super cute and flattering and i love the pattern on this specific style. it is also seems to be very well made. i haven't worn it in the water yet so i can't really speak to that. i would say that i believe it is true to size, which means that it is a little tight since bathing suits need to be tight to stay on in the water! for reference i am a bra size 32dd, around 130 pounds, and 5'5"" and a size 6 fits perfectly.",5
"The image does not show but the front of the dress has a heavy 24"" utility zipper hidden with 5 snaps. the zipper pull, when closed, sat right on my collarbone, which was he height of discomfort. it felt heavy and awkward. the dress was very high waisted for me (i'm 5'6"" and it was 3"" inches above the navel)) also to the point of discomfort.

an invisible side zipper would have made the difference for me if the proportions were better suited for a non-petite sizing.

the fabric is quite beautifu",1
One of my favorites for comfy cute this summer! the color is a beautiful berry color! also love the length... it feels a little longer than a typical top which i love! 5'9,5
"Love marrakech for their jackets! this piece is wonderful! i usually wear an xs or s in this brand in jackets. i went with an xs as the sleeve are a little loose. the body still fits buttoned up- nice and tailored. the stretch keeps in comfy with the tailored fit in the trunk. looks great worn open too. i think the best part is the cut and material. i am 5 '4 and 125 lbs, curvy.",5
"I received this top in my normal xxsp size and it fits perfect. it's roomy so i'm glad i went with the smallest size. the color states pink but it's really between a red and raspberry so it's better looking than pictured. as with most off the shoulder tops, if you raise your hands it slips up, but it actually looks good that way too and forms a square around the neck that appears like that's the natural design. overall, great value, light and flowy, plus the fabric is a soft linen so it breathes",5
"Everything about this top is perfect! quality is great which is number one in my book. color is awesome! perfect color for fall, summer and spring! a must have!!",5
"I love linen i know it's a pain with the wrinkles but it's just a very nice crisp clean feel. this vest is wonderful it fits very nice, once you size down, and can work as a bathing suit cover up. i'm using it with my linen pants and skirts and everyone has asked me where did you get that...i think they're all gone by now but if they aren't grab it while you can it's a must have for any woman's closet.",5
This suit is so flattering on! great support and slimming for my post-three times baby body. i ordered this suit and the skirted maillot by swim by retailer in the white floral. i loved the pattern of the floral more but don't think any chest size larger than a c cup would be supported in that suit.,5
Was looking for a cute off the shoulder top and this is a fun one. can be worn both on or off the shoulders. nice length and the pink is a beautiful raspberry color. love the linen blend too. i'm a size 2 and i ordered the xs. flows away from body - -it's a bit big but i like the style.,5
This top is great. it hangs in the perfect way to hide imperfections. the orange/red is a great accent and i received compliments when i wore it.,5
"Really like this tunic a lot. it is comfortable and easy to throw on and look put together. i'm always a fan of pockets too! i ordered the xs -- i'm 5'4"" about 118#. it fits loose but not in a bad way. the fabric allows it to fall well over the body. if you are tall it will probably be too short for you as it was a few inches above my knees. glad to have snagged this right away! more tunics like this please!",5
"I'm about 5'5"" and normally about 120 lbs so i purchased the small. i'm currently 9 months prego, but i couldn't resist this jacket! i purchased anyway and although it doesn't fit over my belly right now, i'm looking forward to being able to wear it soon! it will be perfect for the chilly office or a casual day. the fabric is beautiful with just the right amount of stretch. like others have said, it has a bit of a navy-ish tint to to it, so it's not truly black. thanks retailer for offering anothe",5
I love purchasing these tunic/ruffle dresses because they can be worn anywhere.....this dress is definitely a little on the heavy side for winter wear...the color is beautiful...i am 5'4''. 138 pounds and always purchase a large for a relaxed fit....i plan to wear it out to dinner for my birthday and to a house party on new years day....,5
Loves it!! this is my new favorite top. it's pretty...it's perfect:-) cannot find any bad to say about it.,5
Just gorgeous . this is one beautiful top. the colors are pretty and vibrant. i wear either a large or xl and the large was great in this top. dress it up or down.this top flows and it drapes beautifully in the back. it looks fantastic with jeans. as a bonus it is lined so no need for any type of piece under it. it's an all year round top. throw a cardigan or wrap over it when the weather cools down and you are set to go. a great top for your wardrobe . i would not hesitant to buy it.,5
"I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.
it runs a little big, so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side, but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it.",5
"This skirt is a beautiful fabric, heavy and soft, and fully lined. it has two sets of snaps on the inside so you can adjust the waist size. i purchased a medium, but found that there wasn't enough of an overlap in the split to be decent (it flaps open when i walk, revealing nearly everything!), so i will be exchanging for a large. for reference, i typically wear a size 10 or 12 in pants and skirts. the color is true to the photos, with a matte finish. i am 5'8"" and length hit me below the knee.",5
Bought the blue/gray - love the color. just the right amount of cling. adorable alone or under cardigan. super deal on sale.,5
"This cardigan is very cute and versatile. the knit is medium weight and will work well for moderate weather. i would say that the sizing is pretty true to size, but maybe runs just a bit large. thus, if you are in between sizes, order the smaller size.",5
"Love this sweatshirt! i'm 5'2"" 110lbs and ordered the x-small. it's a little boxy but very comfy. it's definitely light peach in color and not pink, as shown. very happy with this purchase!",5
"I wanted these jeans so badly! i originally ordered them in my regular size -a 27. they were too big even for a tomboy fit, so i ordered a 26. the size 26 order was backordered and then cancelled. i am so sad! i would absolutely buy these if i could get them in my size. they are so soft and beautiful. i love ag's quality.",5
"I bought one of these as a gift for a friend and i loved it so much i had to get one for myself! it's beautiful material and has lovely detail, a little sheer so best worn with a cami underneath. probably better for those with not too ample busts as it doesn't have a lot of stretch.",5
Even more beautiful in person. runs large as i'm usually a medium and bought a small. great for summer/fall transition.,5
Great sweater with gorgeous detail. fits tts. works best in someone with smaller bust like me. pink is peachy pink like other reviewers have commented. pairing it with gray ag jeans! will work great for fall/winter in louisiana.,5
"Very pretty and delicate top. it is fresh and with a delicate embroidered ""bib"" style. the fabric on the front is silky and the back is a blend of silk and cotton, just that part (the back) could be a little thicker so more durability. still as it is, it's a niece piece and good quality.
i find it you can wear it with dress pants for office or formal gathering and to dress up jeans and either to leave it our or tuck in. since the bib is focal point you can skip any necklace and war dainty earrin",5
"This is a beautiful dress for fall. the fabric is gorgeous and drapey and the skirt is swingy. i ordered this in an xl because that size always sells out first. i think a l might fit a bit better, so i will see if any more come in and order another to compare. it poofs out in the back above the elastic and the waist slides down a bit. it is also very long, i need to hem it about 3-4"". i never know which size to order with this brand, i vary between l and xl.",5
This top was very cute but super short- and i am a short waisted petitie person-the waistline hits above your belly button- looks very silly.,1
This sweater is really fun and even cuter in person.,5
"Colors are much brighter in person, fits well (not frumpy like a lot of open-front sweaters). colors make it perfect for neutrals but maybe hard to mix with other colors. pricey, so still considering whether to keep it.",5
I love the unique design and the fit. they are very flattering. they might be a little too thick to wear in the summer but the rest of the year they will work out great.,5
"I was surprised how much i like this shirt. the fit is really pleasing. at first i thought it would be a ""whatever"" shirt, but i think i will actually wear it a lot more. it will look cute dressed up with a cute necklace and flats. the price is a bit high for this top, but i felt it was worth it since it is so hard finding a casual shirt thats not your basic tee.",5
"The colors in this cardigan are not what they look like on line. the top is navy and the lower arms are grey. the sweater overall has more punch than pictured. this is a cotton sweater and a great fall layering piece. it will look great with a tee shirt and jeans. it is a long sweater, but not too long as to swallow a smaller person up. i also really like that the front is not too flowy. i am looking forward to wearing this all fall.",5
"This sweater is super cute. it has nice weight to it and is just a nice casual but attractive piece to wear with jeans or white pants. love that it zips and just a really cute pattern of marigold, mint/teal and grey/dark gray.",5
Loved this top when i first saw it online and when it arrived it didn't disappoint at all. dress it up or down.,5
"This dress is so beautiful! i ordered it online and when i received it i was so pleased with how it was even better in person. the fit, the embroidery, the lovely fall colors - makes this a perfect dress all the way around!",5
"Not as pink as pictured online, definitely more of a pale peach. fits loose, so i'm glad i went with my normal size, or would seem boxy. cute top, and will wear it around town running errands..instead of my activewear!",5
"The photos really doesn't do this sweater justice. when i saw it in store ii was really drawn to the colors which are a bit brighter than they appear in the photos. this will be great over jeans or slim pants. i usually wear a l or xl and i went with the l which is still roomy enough to layer but not too big. at 5'5"" it drapes nicely and covers my rear end. the arms are a bit long on me but it is a common issue for me as i have short arms. others have mentioned the arms being big but i think the",5
"I love the design of the suit and decided to take a chance and order despite the mixed reviews. i'm so happy i did! i couldn't be happier with the fit, quality and design. for reference, i am 5'8, size 4 and smaller chested (small b cup) and went with a medium. i could see that this suit might not work for everyone but i love it!",5
"The cups on this suit are  ridiculous.  unless you are going to a nudist beach i do not recommend.  the construction of the suit itself was also vey poor. seams were messed up, a big pull right on the front-- i brought it back. sad because the design was adorable- just poor execution.",1
"I just purchased this blouse in store! the fabric has a nice weight and drape, feels nice to the touch and is opaque. i'll be wearing this one as a dress and a top. i'm 5'2"" and this fell a couple inches above my knee. i typically wear an xs at retailer and opted to go with a small for the extra length and because i hate when off the shoulder silhouettes pop up and become not so off the shoulder. i laid the xs and small out to compare sizing and didn't notice a major  difference width wise. i typi",5
"Loving this top! feels comfy and casual like a sweatshirt, but pairs great with a pencil skirt or dress pants to wear to work. easy to dress up and down and i get so many compliments on it! it's fraying a tiny bit on the front, but i think that adds to the not-so-precious vibe. i'm 5'10"" 160# and the m works great!",5
"I love this top.  the fit is great for me. i ordered a small. the color is a bit more peach than the pink in the picture,  but still very cute.",5
Love this gorgeous off the shoulder top! very comfortable and stylish. you can wear it either off the shoulder or not!,5
"I loved this blouses when i saw it on-line, but when i saw it in on me it looked totally different. it runs really large and i didn't like the material of blouse.",5
Love the look of these- casual or dressy depending on what you pair with them. they are so comfortable! edgy but relaxed - joggers with a leather look- what more could you ask for?,5
Received a lot of compliments when i wore this sweater. quality is wonderful. only thing i noticed is that it's a little shorter in length then what i was expecting.,5
"I ordered this item before seeing the july 25th review. i ordered in a s and need an xs. now the xs is sold out unfortunately. my waist measures 27"", hips 32"", and i am 5'4"". the material very nice, has elastic for movement and comfort. i would wear this all the time if i had the correct size. it would be cute dressed down or up.",5
"I fell in love with this top online and was even more pleased when it arrived. it's pure romance in a top. i went to the store and they didn't have it in yet, so i ordered it at the store. free shipping if ordered from store. i was extremely thrilled with everything about this purchase.",5
"This is a charming sweatshirt top with extra details to make it stand out! the front panel has lovely art nouveau style embroidery and cut outs. i'm going to enjoy wearing this with jeans - it looks great with gray or black denim. the colors are fabulous for someone with ""spring"" coloring - the front panel is a very pale peach / peche. i'm 5'4"", 128lbs, with small shoulders and 32c chest, i'm typically a size 2-4 or size xs-s, and ordered an xs. it fits well, a little tighter than on the model -",5
"I love, love, love this top! the cutout pattern in front is such a unique look and is a great way to add some fun to your usual t-shirt and jeans look. it's well made and the fit is great. i got it in petite s which worked great length-wise.",5
"In the fall and winter, i live in my uniform of skinny jeans, boots and a long sweater. this cardigan will be perfect! the fabric is very nice quality and the colors are gorgeous. i can see myself wearing it over and over!",5
"This is the weirdest, greatest material. it feels as soft and as buttery as leather, but doesn't look like leather. it looks more like coated denim. only lighter. and stretchy. so you don't get the vibe you get from the vast majority of vegan leather--thick, rubbery junk trying to masquerade as the real thing.

also gorgeous: the cut. it's straight and slim, but with pleats so hip-less ladies like me look like we have some shape.

i got my regular size, and they fit beautifully, but they are not",5
"I got compliments the moment i walked into the office with those. they look like leather so much, that i had to ensure some people that only some polyester had to ""die"" so i could wear them ;). i am slim, but i think those pants are cut so well and hang so nicely, they make everybody look slimmer, they are also super soft, very comjfortable and the pockets are big enough to hold my beloved smart phone securely without showing a bulge. the pants look very elegant when paired with the right shoes",5
"Gorgeous flowy dress that's great for three seasons. thank you to the previous reviewers for the fit advice. size small was only available and it fits perfectly on me (i'm an m/l on top). i'm short and will have to hem because even with 3"" heels i kept stepping on the back skirt. bodice opening is wide and gapes too much so i will wear a cami bra or fashion tape or have an additional fastener sewn in. there are bright little balls of red trim and unexpected pops of violet embroidery, adding to t",5
"I ordered the floral version of this swimsuit - what you can't really tell from the images is the darling, lavender stripe design that is in set opposite the floral. it's truly a darling suit, and very well made. the fit is very flattering, with oddly enough a conservative yet sexy appeal. i ordered a medium after reading the ""size up"" recommendations from other consumers - but, i've exchanged it for a small. the cup size was over-exaggerated in the medium - and, i had plenty of breathing room i",5
"Very comfortable, well made, great with leggings or skinny jeans.",5
"This is a very well made sweater. it is a nice weight, great for cool mornings and evenings. i don't think you can dress this up but it is perfect with casual pants and jeans. i found it runs large but that makes it suitable for layering over other tops.",5
"Love the lightweight fabric! looks great with skinny jeans. it is flowy, but flattering.
wearing it on my shoulders for work -",5
"This wrap is awesome. soft material, perfect length sleeves with thumb holes (!), and warm, great for layering.",5
"When you order online, you can't always be sure of the quality or sizing you will get. like the other reviewers, i found this piece to be beautiful and well made. it's made from rayon and not sheer. the coral, cream, green, and light gray flowers really pop against the black fabric. this piece is meant to be swingy and loose. however, i started with a large but exchanged for a medium. it still feels a little loose so if you're undecided about sizes, order down.",5
"Cute and comfortable. not sure i'd say it's worth the full price as it's not a very heavy jacket. it did suit my needs though and was otherwise what i was looking for, so i kept it and have enjoyed wearing it.",5
"I just purchased this adorable tank on-line and already received it in my regular size small (34d-27-35) and it fits me tts. the material is actually made with 100% rayon, not polyester as it describes above which makes it even better. the embroidery very beautiful in person as well and the arm openings are just right, not too large for a nice change. if you need a cute tank in black with a little something special, this is the top for you!",5
"To be honest, i bought this as a pregnancy top since i can't bring myself to buy actual maternity wear. it is gorgeously made of lovely light material, and i can actually see myself wearing it even after baby. i find the asymmetrical hemline to be really chic - overall a fave.",5
"I saw this online and loved it, then when it was on sale i went into the store and tried it on and i couldn't resist. the only size that was left in stores was an xs petit and i didn't think that it would fit me because i am usually a regular s/m but it was super comfortable and very stylish. it wasn't too big or too small, it fit me just right without any awkwardness.",5
"The fit, the length, the color, the fabric... cannot say anything negative at all! the sales associates at the store where i tried them on said they had just gotten them in, and she could not wait to see how they looked on. they were just as awed as i was! the pants can easily be dressed up or down.. the brown color is so, so, beautiful! i would expect these to be twice the price for such a high quality pant.  i consider it a timeless cut and can worn for seasons to come.",5
"I am in love with this top! i saw it online, and i was a bit nervous to order it because it's a little pricy for a tank top, and i was worried it was going to be too short on me. i was so wrong! the detail on the top is so beautiful, and looks even better in person! it hit me right at mid hip, and looks so cute with jeans and sandals. i sometimes get frustrated with the cut of the arms with retailer clothes because they are cut so low that you see your bra when you lift your arms, but this top is",5
"I love to layer and this is a great layering piece. it is wonderful for cool crisp mornings . this cardigan looks great with skinny jeans and a cute tee. the model in the photo shows a super way to look great for a casual day. so soft and comfortable, i did not want to take it off on the cloudy day it was worn. very happy with this purchase and delighted i was able to get it on sale.",5
"So, i really like this sweater, as you'd expect for this price point, it's stylish in a very single way. so glad i read the review before mine to size down. the xs is great and i wouldn't want bigger. i love the length: how it goes long and cones in a little at the bottom, and the pockets are higher(i always need pockets for my phone). the stripes are well draped as the sweater transitions from shoulder to arm. the cuffs are fun, too. 
bottom line:  i'm really glad this came on sale and i snatc",5
Beautiful top that will go with anything. looking forward to wearing it.,5
"This caught my eye, purely by accident as i was in the dressing room. immediately attracted to the pattern, the color, the quality and the shape of the skirt. lo and behold, it turned out to be maeve, one of my favorite designers at retailer. this skirt does not disappoint at all. i normally try to wait for sales to make a purchase, but this is well worth the full retail price. the skirt is very well made. the material is structured but not stiff. i also don't normally like high waisted ski",5
This is quite long on my 5'1 frame but it's wool and will be amazing in the fall and winter. so happy i finally ordered this,5
"I bought this skirt in the store a few months ago, because i anticipated that retailer would sell out of my size considering how great the fit/look of this skirt is. sure enough, they've sold out of the size 2. normally i wear a size 4, sometimes 6, in skirts depending on the cut and where it's from; just last year i bought a skirt from retailer in a size 10! for me, this was a skirt i needed to try on to get the perfect size, but it's absolutely adorable and a great deal at the sale price! it's mod",5
"I personally like light garment and simple design for my daily dresses.  it meets my needs.
i personally recommend it to customers.",5
Always love getting pilcro pants and these are just as good as previously purchased ones. i got the grey in 32 and i'm glad i did - i've ranged from a size 30-34 so i wasn't super sure which size would be be best.,5
Wish they had more colors avail in my size when i bought this one. you can easily dress it up or down.,5
Bought the gray and peach in the store and loved it so much ordered the other colors online. this top is very comfortable and stylish. it stands out from the crowd as just enough different to be very unique and trendy but still a classic look. the sweater front is very soft and the back has a bit of a silk feel but not sheer. i also like that the back is a bit longer than the front.,5
"Corduroy fabric is historically difficult to fit well....even with stretch added. so imagine my surprise when i tried on the pilcro serif mid-rise corduroy pants in the saffron yellow shade and they fit great! they were long enough as well. i loved them so much that i ordered the aqua shade as well and when that pair arrived, it fit just a nicely as the yellow ones. how wonderful that there is finally a corduroy pant that truly fits well. these are not old lady pants either...how nice!",5
"This sweater is so lovely, i bought it first in navy and then came back for it in grey. very soft and comfortable. the back doesn't wrinkle the way you might think it would from the pics alone. very flattering. i highly recommend it!",5
"I ordered this in large since it was the last one available. i normally wear a med, but i do enjoy the oversize look in silhouettes like this one. the armholes are very low, but since i have hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating) this does not bother me one bit. i'll just wear a super lightweight tank underneath for coverage/protection. also, the oversize fit allows me to wear a long sleeve for layering if i desire. i love the flow and fluidity of the material and will be wearing this one a lot.",5
"I saw this top online and fell in love with the overall casual look.
i ordered all 3 colors, and they just arrived........love love love !!!
they are soft, comfortable and a have a very flattering casual fit.
the understated ruffled details add the special ""something"" that is so retailer.
they are sophisticated yet pretty.
the orange is more vibrant in person and is a beautiful shade.
the plum/purple is a rich, unique and pretty color.
the navy is a perfect ""denim"" color.
a fantastic basic",5
"Good dress to wear with heels, flats, tights. versatille!",5
"These got me so excited for fall. the teal is a color i'm really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these. when they arrived though, i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch. the fit is snug, but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable! these will be a staple in my wardrobe. i want to order more colors!",5
"I am in love with these. bought the regular length last year and loved them despite the shortness (hit right above the ankle). that length looks good with ballet flats or tucked into boots. this year i bought the burgundy and the teal in the long length. i am 5'7"" and the long fit perfectly! they come to the bottom of my ankle without extra fabric. 
please restock the ""carbon"" in the long length! i want to buy my 4th pair!",5
I love these pants the only thing i would say is that they don't run small! i read reviews saying they are small in the waist so i ordered a size up and ended up regretting it. other then that i love them,5
"At 6' tall, it's hard to find pants that fit my inseam (35"") and these fit the bill. i normally wear a 30 or 31 tall in pants (from brands like ag or paige), but i bought these in a 29 tall as i find pilcro tends to run large. they are soft and comfortable and don't stretch out 3 sizes by the end of the day, which is great. they feel like leggings! the wine color looks just like the images. for those who find measurements helpful, i'm 6' tall, 160lbs with about 42"" hips and a 35"" inseam.",5
"Bought my 3rd pair of pilcro cords in the dark turquoise. the other 2 are from previous seasons. love these pants for fall because they are extremely comfortable and stylish. the dark turquoise was paired with the poppy tunic (in blue) at my local store. i liked the pairing and ended up buying both! i find these to fit true to size vs other items at retailer that fit larger. i am a 29 (8) while in most other pants at retailer, i am a 6. i am 5'7 and 135 lbs.",5
"I love this dress, is perfect in every way. no complaints. very pretty colors. will wear it with a belt.",5
These pants are so soft and comfortable!! the colors are great too. can't wait to buy more in other colors!,5
These tight cords are perfect for fall.,5
"Unfortunately, does not look anything like in the picture. looks like an oversized house robe. i expected much more but was disappointed. i am definitely returning it.",1
"I really like this top. it is made of cotton and linen blend, so the fabric is not as soft as i would have expected. however, it did not bother me at all, and i am really liking it.
the fabric is on a sheer side, so it is a bit see through. nothing too revealing, however it is a thin fabric.
overall, i am happy with this top!",5
"Although this isn't a soft top, i didn't find it that scratchy or bothersome at all. it's 55% linen! and, for linen it's soft. it's also got tons of stretch which makes it very comfortable as far as movement. 

i bought the black, and i do not find this sheer or see-thru. it's a light thickness which makes it perfect for layering under a jacket or sweater for a cool spring or warm fall day. i found it running tts, with the sleeves and length a little long (i'm petite) making perfect for the av",5
More of a legging than a true pant. fits really well. grey color is great and will go with lots of things.,5
"I fell in love with this top in the store and ordered another online. it is very soft and comfortable. the petite tend to run a little short in the front, but the regular is perfect. it's oversized without being frumpy or boxy on my petite frame.",5
"These cords are great, the fit, the style, everything! my new favorite fall pants!",5
"I first bought this top in the dark grey, loved it so much that i ordered the navy too! the quality is amazing as always, and fit is perfect (some may say it runs large, but i'm pretty sure it is meant to have a looser fit). i love the material of the lighter color blocked back. it's so versatile and easy to throw on. i've worn it simply with jeans, and i've also paired it with a pencil skirt and overlapping skinny belt and heels for a great work outfit (received compliments!).",5
"This piece fits true to size and is very flattering on. sometimes i worry about my stomach not being perfectly flat, but this wasn't an issue at all, probably because of the intricate lace details. the fabric is substantial enough that i don't feel like it'll get a hole in it after multiple wears.",5
"This print/color combination is really pretty. i think it's a little muted compared to the picture, but still very pretty. it is definitely longer than expected - i'm 5'-5"" and it almost touches the floor. will definitely need to wear with heels. colors will actually work in the fall with boots and in spring with heeled sandals. it actually has a shorter underskirt, so there's no accidental show. i really like the dark blue wrap #extra fabric at top# - sits below the waist and will help hide imp",5
"Such an adorable top. very flattering despite it's rather full style. just be sure you get the correct size since it does indeed run quite large. i normally wear a small, sometimes medium. i ordered both sizes to be sure but they were both too large! i sized down to xs and that fit perfectly.",5
I am six feet tall and this sweater is a perfect fit for tunic length over skinny jeans. if you are shorter i assume it would be longer. i bought the green color which is a beautiful dark hunter green. the bodice is fitted and doesn't show any bra straps and the bottom is slightly loose and forgiving . love this sweater!,5
"This dress is amazing! the fit, style, quality of fabric is just perfect. just the right amount of ""v"" in the front and back to be flattering and sexy without being too exposed! will be looking for more styles from this designer!",5
"I love this top!! it is flattering in all the right places. i struggle with shirts the are too flowy however this is forgiving yet looks more fitted and flattering. i bought the shirt in blue and am buying it now in red! i typically buy a large or xl, in this shirt a large is perfect!",5
Love these - the colors are perfect for fall. originally ordered a small which fit fine (i'm a 6-8) but felt the black color would look better if i sized up and the material wasn't as stretched - i'm glad i exchanged for a medium for that reason.,5
"I am truly heartbroken that this dress is sold out in my size -- it's is incredibly flattering, glamorous, and interesting. and it has sleeves! this is such a hard combo to find and i wish more than anything i can find my size to wear to a wedding. retailer, please please make more dresses like this one that flatter all figures and are classics.",5
"I saw this dress online and i ordered immediately!
it has everything i love: my fav color, a peplum and feminine cut out details.
i ordered my usual size medium, and it was too tight in the chest, and i am just average... 34c.
loved it so reordered in a size large.
if you are thinking of purchasing this beauty i would suggest going up a size if you are on the upper end
of your size (medium 8/10 and i am usually a 10 so needed to go up)
the reason i gave the quality a lower rating is that the med",5
"This is a lovely, well-fitting, embroidered, navy tank, i cannot find a flaw in this. i am 5'5, 142 lbs., 34d and the size 6 is a fantastic fit. one of those tops that is so well-cut that it feels as if one is wearing nothing. the lining is impeccably done and is cut perfectly for the blouse. it has a small cut-out in the back at the v. it fits just as the photo shows and is so versatile-it can be worn with everything from jeans to a formal skirt. six stars!",5
This is such a cute top. it runs large...i bought an xs and usually wear a small or medium. it's flowy and comfy. looks great with dark jeans.,5
"Bought this dress for my daughter to wear to a rehearsal dinner and i couldn't believe how beautifully it fit. fitted through the top, falling to a gorgeous flare. hit her at knee (she's 5""6'). classic, elegant, femme fatale look that will work for a range of occasions.",5
I saw this top on a store mannikin and was drawn to it by it's color and print. it looked great with blue jeans on display and a lariat necklace. then i noticed the different design on the back below the yoke. the surprise was its being pleated into very fine pleats. i liked the funky quality this added. the design is a good transitional piece to wear early fall or under a jacket. it is machine washable and that finalized the purchase of it. i bought the necklace too. i often wear a small but go,5
Adorable with black pants or jeans. covers the part of your arm you might want covered :-),5
"The fabric is incredibly soft and has a good weight to it. this is also pretty warm. it's not a down jacket, but it's as least as warm as a sweatshirt. it fits close to the body in typical bomber jacket fashion. i'm 5'6 155 lbs and went with the large, which fits well. i always find myself wishing bomber jackets were just a tad longer and this is no exception, but i can't really fault the jacket for that, it's true to the style.",5
"This sweatshirt is really nice!  it's oversized so best worn with leggings or skinny jeans. it's very warm, without being too thick. it looks almost exactly like the picture.   the quality seems pretty good, but we'll see how it holds up after it's washed.",5
"I am in love with the pilcro brand. this pair is gorgeous. i love the how versatile these will be in my wardrobe. i can dress them up with a nice blazer, sweater or dress them down with t-shirts or tanks. these will be a staple in my wardrobe. they are a nice navy blue.",5
Very cute top! even prettier in person! i ordered it by mistake but i am definitely keeping it! the regular xs size fits perfectly (i was concerned about my twin sisters!),5
"I bought this dress for my bridesmaids and it fit all 6 different body types wonderfully! it is a very classic look. the material is very nice, a little heavier and more formal.",5
"Super cute blouse- great with a jean jacket, - sleeved or sleeveless. pleating is neat and a nice unique detail, without getting to full. usually a 4 or small in blouses, bought the xs. made this decision based on the arm hole openings, seemed a little large and set low on the small. .",5
"Dress was a disappoint. very thin and cheaply made, not worth the money at all. pictures make it look much better than in real life. top area is also made small so if you are busty, this is not the dress for you.",1
This tank caught my eye in the store yesterday. i was taken by the design contrast of the front and back. the colors are beautiful and rich. i see this as the perfect tank to transition into the fall season. the top does run a little big. i sized down to a medium. i am just under 5'5 and am a 36g.,5
Saw this hanging in the store. it is cute front and back.  it is flattering as well. i plan to wear under a jacket for work and without a jacket at night.  looks amazing with a denim jacket,5
"I love this top!!! i usually wear a medium but all that was left were larges, so i figured i'd take a chance. it is gorgeous, and not too big! the quality is fabulous, and the color is very soft and complimentary. i am so glad i ordered this. can't wait to wear it!!!",5
"I was looking for the full legged pants with a slit, light enough for the beach. they have my size finally! i'm a regular 12 and m worked well for me. can't wait to wear these with a nice top.",5
"The shirt is beautiful, but fits much too small. the stitching limits the space in your shoulders, and the hem too short. a petite frame would be able to pull this off- but i am a 5.10"" medium, and the shirt didn't work in every direction.",1
"I'm in love with these tanks. so in love that i bought four of them (black, grey, blue, and the black motif). they are so flattering on. i love the low scoop neck and the wide straps. the cut is interesting enough to wear the shirt on its own, but also perfect for under a cardigan. i purchased a nearly identical one from retailer (which was made by velvet) several months ago and it was much more pricey. these are a much more affordable option.",5
"Wow! this skirt blew me away out of the package! i almost had to wonder if i received the right skirt i had ordered! i thought the skirt was mostly an oatmeal isth color , but irl the skirt is predominantly purple with real and beige colors weaved in! the skirt itself is also a fine sweater knit which makes it look more luxurious! i'm thinking this skirt will look awesome in the fall, but might be a bit heavy for some in the summer weather. the skirt is also longer than expected... i'm 5'6"" and",5
"I wish it was a little bigger.i kept this,for it will be wonderful for summer.",5
I ordered this cutie before i read any reviews and i am so glad i did. mine does not have any weird smell at all. i ordered a medium and i wear a size 8. it fits perfectly and is long enough to wear with leggings ...with coverage. the detailing on the yoke is so pretty. i bought it with a discount promotion so it made the price better. i am really glad to add it to my wardrobe!!,5
I always look at jumpsuits but they never seem to work for me because of my height (5'1) and petite stature. i ordered the xxsp and it fits perfectly! so comfortable and made of high quality silk which you can really feel is well made. love that there is no zipper- just a hidden elastic tube top and a hook and eye below the nape of the neck. plan on wearing this for my 30th birthday with heels or booties and a cropped leather jacket!,5
"This dress is adorable and professional at the same time. i was worried that the print would overpower me but it's a nice fabric. i'm 5'2"" and the petite small is perfect. i don't like to wear form fitting clothing for work and this fits right for me. plus it's hand washable. i haven't worn or washed it yet but i'll easily wear it to my ""creative professional"" workplace.",5
"I was in the store looking specifically for long sleeved tops that are cute and found this! pretty color pinky purple and my usual xs is perfect. i'm 5'6"", 127 lbs, 34b. love this--definitely unique and feminine. and--no--nary a smell in the mix!",5
"This is a beautiful lightweight sheer blouse. the front has a liner and the arms and back are sheer. i usually wear a s or xs - the xs was plenty roomy. i'll wear a cami due to the sheerness of the back .the cutouts in the long sleeves are quite pretty. overall this is a classy blouse that can be worn with any number of jeans, slacks or skirts. thanks retailer!",5
"Love this tank! prettier shade of yellow in person. love the strap width and length. wish they'd bring back more in lots of colors. i sized up one from my usual size and will have to shorten the length of the strap myself, but it's an easy alteration and is totally worth it! especially good at sale price. i really hope they make more in the style in lots of colors. great find!",5
"I bought this top in my usual size large and it is slightly big, but not so much that i would want to size down.  the material is slightly itchy, but i think that it's worth it because it's such a pretty top. i absolutely love the detail at the top.  it is beautiful!  if you wear a nude bra, you can't see the strap lines through the material.  i also love the coloring of this top.  this is a great top that i can see myself wearing with dress pants for work or with jeans for a more casual look.",5
"I'd been waiting to snatch up this jumpsuit as it looks so cute online, so when it went on sale i ordered it right away. well i was thoroughly disappointed. i agree with some of the other reviewers, the fit is odd, huge on top and too snug on the bottom. being made of flimsy silk it has no give and didn't hang well on my curvy body, being too loose in some areas and too snug in others. also the top is embroidered while the bottom isn't. the material is thin and and it definitely isn't high enoug",1
The picture doesn't do these justice! they are beautiful and a must-have for summer date nights. i am 5'2 and hover between 115-120. i tried on the regular size in-store and they were way too long. so i ordered the xs petite and they fit perfectly! i like to pair them with a flowy top that hangs over the waist band. (not styled like the pic). they literally feel like you are wearing nothing. you'll receive so many compliments - trust me!,5
"I bought a similar tee by velvet by graham and spencer a couple years ago and have been searching for another one ever since. the wide straps are flattering on me because of my broad shoulders. i love the price too, very reasonable. i want one in every color.",5
"This dress is absolutely stunning! the colors are vibrant and it flows very nicely touching the floor. 
 it runs very small, i ordered size medium and i could not even zip the dress, i normally wear size 10. i had to return it and order again in size large. i love the fit this time!! but be aware if your normal size is higher than 10 this dress will not fit and larger sizes are not available for this dress. it is nice addition to my wardrobe and i am planning to wear it to the multiple occasion",5
Very sheer inexpensive material. even on sale i'm returning it,1
Great tank top! loved it so much that i ordered 3!,5
"This shirt smelled so bad when i received it (and i am not at all sensitive to smells). is it from the dye? 
i tried it on anyway. it is shapeless and nothing special. at almost 80 bucks it is so over priced.",1
"Lovely top with details and a unique color. i have read some other reviews and i honestly don't know why it is getting bad reviews. it is linen but not scratchy by any means, like linen it does give with wear, so i recommend sizing down as it does run a little large. with a nude bra you won't see your straps and i would dryel this, no washing of any kind, linen shrinks! overall great top and i was glad i snatched one up.",5
"This is a super flattering, cute tank! i've purchased it in several colors because it's such a great fit. somewhat thin material and slightly sheer (especially the white). i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit' fat shows. looks great with pilcro capris for a cute, casual summer look! i wish they would come out with even more colors!",5
"This is a rare review for me, i usually love my retailer purchases, even at times when other reviewers aren't fans, but this top is terrible. 5'4"" 103, 32 b for reference, small frame, athletic, bought the xs in black. the length could have been longer, but i could have lived with the length. the arm hole area, however, a different story. because it's boxy, and the fabric is stiffer bc of the large flowers, the top sticks out on the sides under the arm holes leaving a gape, it did not fit snuggly",1
"Looks just like it does on the model. i am 5'130lbs and the ps fits perfectly. i wore mine with a t and wedges. adorable and more importantly, comfortable! flows nicely without being distracting. got lots of compliments.",5
"Knitted midi skirts are part of my daily uniform so i was drawn to this one. its high quality showcases intricate details: the pattern on the front is different from that on the back, the hem is asymmetric and is reverse high-low, the flat waist means the skirt is not too voluminous. the colors and pattern are reminiscent of missoni. it should be easy to coordinate with solid tops. wonderful quality and machine washable. i'm 5'5"" and the petite medium fits me as pictured. since i want the back t",5
"This shirt had an overpowering vinegar odor when i took it out of the packaging.

the mint green color was appealing but the styling did not look good and the smell was too much.",1
"Love the material, pockets, length (i wear petitie - i'm 5'3) etc. i usually wear a medium, but this dress runs incredibly large. i was drowning in it and sadly had to return it. size one or two sizes down if you want to purchase!!",5
Awesome basic top for your wardrobe. it's a little sheer but not too much.,5
I love this tank! basic but super sexy! i'm an a cub and this tee makes them look a lil bigger so i'll take it!! i bought the dark grey in small and went back for the striped grey and purchased small. i bought the black one too but i feel like the small in black is too big and the xsmall is too small. i'm torn because i want the black to tuck in a pencil skirt.,5
I saw the tank at the store and was so glad to try it on. i got the small?i'm in between xs and s (34b) and try to get petites when i can but the small fit great with a longer cut. i bought the green and did not find it sheer. i actually thought it was thicker than most tanks and tees these days. i found the arm holes were fine. i usually need to go with a petite just for this reason but no need to this time. planning on getting a couple of more colors!,5
"First of all, the photo online doesn't really do the colors of this skirt justice. it is a heathered knit, with colors of white, gold (deep yellow), raspberry (or almost maroon), and teal. i have never seen a color combo like this before, and its really fun. i am wearing it today with a burgundy color sweater, but i anticipate being able to match it for summer with any of those colors i just mentioned, or even navy or tan. the skirt has a lining in it, and the wide ribbed knit runs at varying an",5
I tried this on in-store in white and in grey. it is so super comfy and really cute. i love the wide straps! i ended up getting it in white and black. the grey looked a tad bit more casual than the white and black tanks.,5
"This gorgeous dress really does bloom before your eyes. the silk is light, airy and very delicate. the bodice runs large and the length runs long (i have to wear my highest platforms) but i would not return because it's an exquisite piece of art.",5
This is a great fall shirt. great for dressing up casual wear!!!,5
"I ordered the red motif in size m based on reviews this top runs small and it is too big. i'm 5'7""/ 34c /132 lbs and usually a size s in this brand. this top was large through the body and the arm openings were huge. i washed it and dried it but it still fits a bit large, it did wash up well though, no pilling.",5
"Just purchased this skirt. it is absolutely the most comfortable skirt for every season......every color imaginable will go with this skirt. great with denim shirt too. lightweight cotton knit makes the skirt comfy with any temperature. waistband is wide and slimming to the tummy. i stand 5 foot 10 inches, 174 lbs and it is perfect in length. platform or flats, dress up or down. my favorite is a v neck tee with a couple necklaces and your good to go......",5
"There's something special about this tank that makes it uber-flattering. the fabric is perfect, the colors (green and fuchsia) are spot-on gorgeous and brightening, and the cut (length, wide straps, and scooped neckline) make this the perfect staple. it flattered my figure, skin color, and really hid my flaws. i wish i could get away with wearing this every day...",5
"I purchased the turquoise in a petite- xs. normally items at retailer run on the larger side and this shirt fit just right (i am 4ft 11inches and 100lbs). the material was a little on the lite side which makes a great summer fit, but it is a bit weak (so it can tear easily). it looks great with all types of skirts and jeans. i just wish retailer would sell more of the petite sizes. i went back in to buy more in other colors and they are sold out already!",5
It definitely smells like vinegar but it went away after a few hours. i don't think its itchy. its kind of baggy and kind of has an ombrã© look to it fading down to darker. it looks casual in the pic but i can wear it out at night with cute earrings,5
This is a cute top but i wore it for around 5 hours and lo and behold i had smurf skin. i did not sweat in it but the color transferred to my underarm area and bra and it did not come off in the shower!! i guess it's going to have to wear off. thank goodness it was not a hot day!! i hope that i can return it.,1
"This is a very flattering pencil skirt. i found it in the store and bought an xs, and have been wearing it to work. it is not too short, and the wrap fit looks great.",5
"Super soft and comfy, with stylish look",5
"Thank goodness i packed this on a recent trip to adirondacks because it kept me warm in the cool mountain weather. i love gray so i was drawn to this open stitch sweater. it is a boxy bulky look but a great layering piece. most bulk is in front, so it can camouflage areas. i wore this over a gray and black flannel plaid shirt. perfect!",5
"I was surprised at how much i liked this sweater. i was watching it for awhile and when it went on sale i decided to give it a try. i couldn't decided on the rose or black so i ordered both since they were such a good price, figuring i would return the color i didn't want. boy was i happy i ordered both. the rose is very flattering and the fit is so much better than i expected. i am 5'9' and usually take a large in size. i could have gone down one size, but the front drapes against your body it",5
Runs a bit tight around upper arms. love the collar.,5
"I stumbled upon the blue version in the store. i immediately liked that it was easy, chic, and just different-enough. after wearing it for a birthday dinner, i saw it online and realized that i had styled it almost exactly the same way the blue one is shown. black sandal wedges, silver cuff, silver earrings. it is flattering in an unexpected way, which may be partially because i am really small-chested. the front v is deep compared to what i usually wear, but double-sided tape easily kept my bra",5
"I absolutely loved this the minute i saw it. the quality is impeccable, and the fit is amazing. i will agree with the other reviewer in that the fabric is very thick (back to the quality of this piece, amazing!!) and some women may not like the extra ""bulk"" to that part of the body. however i'm still on the hunt now for the perfect white top to go with it. thank you retailer for always providing unique, quality pieces :)",5
"This dress may not be worth the full price of $138 but on sale it is one huge bargain! so easy to wear and so incredibly flattering! seriously, i don't know why it's not sold out at this price! it hides all flaws without looking oversized or bulky. i totally disagree with the reviewer who called this dress ""sack"" like. found this tts. looks great with pumps or flats.",5
"I have been looking for a long jacket with personality for a while now. i got one from retailer 5 years ago and i've been looking for something just as great. walked into the store and fell absolutely in love. the fit is true to size, i prefer my jackets pretty fitted. the color seemed a bit rosey in the store, but now that i'm home seems more tan and brown. it's not going to be super warm, perfect for fall in colorado and warmer winter days. it's soft, so soft, not bulky at all. if this is your s",5
"This is stunning. it's almost snug for a 2 (i'm 5'6, 123 lb) but that might be because it's strapless. it's constructed with a bra inside so you can get away without wearing one. i can't wait to wear this and i'm going to have to find an event good enough to deserve this dress. i feel like audrey hepburn in this.",5
"The pattern attracted me to this top in store and when i tried it on, i was pleasantly surprised it has a slight swing shape to it which i love. i'm a 36c/d and normally wear an 8 or 10 and bought this in a large. the front buttons don't peek open and actually lays flat which is unusual for me with button up tops. i'm actually wearing it today with some printed green shorts. the stripes on this top make it easy to mix patterns, too :)",5
"The material of this swimsuit is amazing. the swimsuit is expensive, but it is high quality in person. definitely one i'd recommend buying!",5
"This robe is exactly what i was looking for.  it's perfect for lounging around while getting ready and also good for post-shower while i'm still drying off.  it is a little shorter than it looks on the model, but that's fine for me.  only downside is that it has to be hand washed.",5
"I think this shirt is so cute. it is well-made. it's a flattering fit, and it's unusual. it still is a neutral though so you can wear it with lots of things. i'm really happy i bought it.",5
"I ordered this dress online and didn't really know what to expect. but to my surprise, it's exactly what i had hoped it would be. the dress is a fantastic fit and has a modern, interesting print. the fabric does seem thin for the price. but i am not returning it. it's a casual summer dress that kicks up my look a notch on weekends. i wear it with beige sandals, and the gray and beige look good together too.",5
"Like the other reviewers said, it has a lot of bulky fabric if you wear it as pictured. i tried it on and tied the string around the back so it's an open vest. i love if!",5
"This dress is extremely flattering on and looks a lot better when worn than on the hanger. the cut drapes very nicely and is true to size. i am 5 feet tall / 95lbs and the xxsp fit perfectly. it is a bit short however, so i would caution that it may not be work ""office"" appropriate if you are taller. like most hd in paris dresses, it is also quite thin although lined. this dress would look lovely with a either delicate jewelry or a bold statement piece and is casual enough for a lunch outing or",5
"I bought the gray and white to take on a trip. i wore it nearly every other day. looks good layered with a cami or short sleeved t-shirt. also threw on a blazer one chilly night and it looked nice enough to have a dinner out.came home and bought it in red and white and solid white. true to size. not clingy, not baggy and comes down just long enough to cover the tummy.",5
I was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy.  this dress had a lot of potential [i was drawn to the print]  but the material is awful. so thin and scratchy! immediately went back.,1
"I love wearing this sweater, it is unbelievably soft and cozy. usually a sweater like this sits like an unflattering sack on me, so i was pleasantly surprised by how flattering it was on my petite frame. i purchased a grey xs regular in store and i am 5'3"" 120 lbs and it was long, but not at all overwhelming. it sat very flattering on my figure and kept me warm at work on this rainy cold day. i wore mine with skinny capri jeans and purple suede kitten heels. would look great with leggings and bo",5
"I bought this sweater in the gray color and love it! it is so very comfortable, very soft. it looks great with jeans or leggings.",5
"I ordered this bra in my normal size 32d, and it fits me perfectly. this bra is beautiful. the material seems to be very high quality, and the comfort of this bra is amazing. it's definitely a keeper.",5
"I love this sweater. i bought it on sale in maroon and it is the most comfortable sweater ever. i like to wear it with leggings. it has a nice, oversize fit and is perfect for ""fat"" days. or any day.",5
I was looking for a top to go with leggings that didn't look like a sack and this is perfect. the v-neck and unusual cut on the bottom makes it more interesting than a typical tunic and the fabric is so snuggly. love it.,5
"Beautiful piece! the model actually doesn't do this piece justice. it is stunning. a light, yet quality fabric that drapes effortlessly and ties comfortably. great with a white tee and sllm jeans. runs ever so slighty large, but i took my normal size (xs) and for the type of piece it is, it works.",5
"Wonderful, slimming leggings. snappy and a great accessory for any professional outfit.",5
"I have tried this on several times now and have yet to pull the trigger. i like the coral color the best for its versatility. the detailing on this cardigan is fantastic. i especially like the back, the stitching is already very flattering, but then the pleats really add an extra touch. the only reason i have not bought it yet is that i wish it was slightly longer-especially with it being a cashmere piece. i am slightly worried about it shrinking in any way, which would make it much too short an",5
"I love this top-it fits true to size, hits at the low hip so its not too short, and can be worn casually or dressed up. i wore it with ripped ag stevie ankle jeans, freebird by stevie worn brown buckled ankle boots, and a glittery silver necklace, but it would have also looked good with turquoise jewelry. i also plan to pair it with the cabernet-turquoise cecelia prado sparkly skirt, tights and boots, and a jean jacket or black moto jacket. this top would also look amazing with the sanctuary arm",5
This jacket is cute and comfy!,5
"I had never tried on a romper or jumper. the print of this changed my mind and i'm glad for it. it looks amazing on is easy to wear. i kind of wish it were lined but it's probably better unlined to keep it light and cool for the summer. 

i did end up using double stick take bc the front was so low but it was worth it.",5
"Pictures do not do this top justice. looks much cuter in person !
it caught my eye right away in the store.
perfect top for when the weather starts getting a little cooler.",5
"Just a ginormous, shapeless shirt. runs extremely large. i am normally a medium to large in shirts and the medium was huge. i can only imagine an xs would work and i am no xtra small!",1
"This jacket is exactly what i was looking for! it is a lightweight and comfortable material that will be perfect for fall/spring (and for layering during a mild winter!). i am 5'3, 128 lbs, and generally wear a small - but i ordered a medium in this jacket and am happy i sized up. the jacket is roomy, but the cinched waist makes it flattering rather than shapeless. i'd definitely recommend this anorak to anyone!",5
I loved the contrasting design of this sweater. i loved it even more when it arrived. its soft and true to size. i received so many compliments which sealed the deal.,5
It's maybe a bit longer than i'd like but cute-great with slacks or dresses!,5
"I happened upon this one in store in my xs size. online it would not catch my eye, but in person i love it. it fits like a glove and is so soft and elegant with the knit detailing, pleats, and length in the back. i couldn't pass this one up. i also agree with the other reviewers about colors:/",5
"I'm usually a small or medium in retailer tops, however, jackets i tend to wear a small......liking a more fitted look. this jacket i also purchased a small, but there is plenty of room, so might have even worn an xs. anyway, the material is great, is well made, wonderful pocketsi, super comfy, but maybe a little too warm for summer nights. i cuffed up the sleeves......had no issue with the length. i'm 5'6"", 36c and i couldn't be happier with this purchase. happy mother's day to me!",5
Can't wait to wear this during the holidays. beautiful embroidery and detailing.,5
I love love this sweater it's beautiful on and super comfy. my only complaint is that it had a snag and a hole in the back. so i can't say it's good quality.,5
"This coat is very soft and flattering in design. good quality and very comfortable. i usually wear a small which is what i got and it fits well. if anything, it is a little snug across the shoulders when i reach forward, so if you plan on wearing a heavier layer underneath, go up a size.",5
"I bought the ivory in my usual size xs and the fit is flattering and quality is good. it is a good weight for spring, summer and fall. i love that it is a natural cotton/linen blend. the turquoise was not available in my size initially but when it restocked for a short time i ordered it, also! i know i won't be disappointed. beautiful sweater with great details.",5
"The fabric is very nice and it is completely lined, except for the sleeves, which are sheer. i expected the dress to be lighter, so wearing this on a hot day won't work. i ordered an xs because of the former reviews it said it ran large and it does. it's roomy, straight, and quite flowy.  i wanted a casual non clinging dress and it's just like the picture. it hits below the knee.",5
"This is a classic, well made, velvet top. it fits true to size, is very flattering ,the on- line photos don't do it justice. very pretty in real life. 34a 123 lbs ordered the xs.",5
This would be a great blouse for flat chested person. i am a size 12 and busty. i ordered an xl and it was ridiculously tight across the chest and the fabric is see through. you would need to wear a cami under it.,1
"Love it! cute, flattering, and even though the material is thin - it is still very cozy. i have no complains about the quality; i haven't found any loose threads or other issues.

the cardigan runs tts. i got m instead of my usual s (because s was out of stock), and it's a little loose in the armpits. but i still like the cardigan and i'm keeping it.",5
Was looking for something lighter as we go into warmer temperatures and this one is greatz looks just like pictured and ha a flattering fit.,5
"I had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it. i found the fit to be true to size. i am 5'4, 107 pounds and i bought the xs, which is my usual size in retailer jackets. i love the material and the way it hangs so casually.",5
Went to the local store today for something else and left with this in the cream color. it is just simply awesome. i could have worn the s but felt that the m would be a little better. i'm between a s and m most of the time. can't say enough good things about the quality and versatility of this sweater. great piece for cooler summer nights and for a cover up for pilates/yoga. can't wait to wear it and now i'm tempted by the teal.,5
"This is the first romper i've ever purchased and i'm instantly in love. it's flows, the colors are vibrant and the pockets are practical. looking forward to wearing it for the rest of the season as well as next year.",5
"Was excited to find an retailer pkg awaiting in my mailbox. ripped open the package and immediately tried on the sweater. it did not disappoint. i bought turquoise in size medium. my regular retailer cardigan size. i am 5'3"" medium build and i find the regular size fits me true to size. it isn't too long on me at all. i think the way the sweater drapes in a curve shape as it flows downs to the length of sweater makes it very accommodating for various heights, figures and is a flattering style for cu",5
I love this jacket and can't get enough of it. it has side pockets as well as the buttoned-pockets. i love the cinched waist option for a more fitted look.,5
"I just received this beautiful suit. i have purchased a boyleg from seafolly before and loved it!
this color way is totally different. it is a white background with a floral pattern that is not over the top.
i am a 32 dd and wear a clothing size 4. i purchased the 6. this suit definitely will accommodate small bust too.
my sister is a 34 b size 4 clothing and it fit as well.
way to go retailer with another winner!!!!",5
"I am 5'6"", 130lbs, size 27, short-legged, and these jeans fit perfectly. i've learned that pilcro's serif fit is my go to, and these did not disappoint. not only are they a flattering fit, they are the ideal medium blue denim, and they aren't covered in excessive whiskering, which seems to plague most jeans.",5
"I could live in these jeans, they are so comfortable. they are have the perfect amount of stretch and the fabric is so soft. i was skeptical because that usually means they lose their shape and i'm yanking on them all day, however, i have worn them 3 days now and on the third day they may have stretched a little in the waist. i am normally a 28, but can get away with 27 sometimes; i chose the 28 and felt the fit was perfect. by the way, i'm wearing the jeans with the cubanas ciara glitter boots,",5
I love these jeans! the perfect amount of stretch. very figure flattering. perfect for lounging around or a night out.,5
"I adore this top! the tencel fabric feels like a nicely worn out denim shirt that's been worn for years. it is a versatile piece that can be worn year round.  even if the sleeves are pulled onto the shoulders,  it still works and looks just fine. i'm broad in the shoulders, and we'll endowed,  but the large was perfect.",5
"Agree with previous reviewer. i am usually an xs p in this brand (5'3"" 115 lbs) but i could not get the internal slip over my head. the chest area was fitted (i am a 32b) but then the skirt was very full and loose. i could have cut out the slip, but worried it would be see through and just not worth it at full price.",1
"I purchased these in january and today i am going back to retailer to request a refund; the fabric on the inner thighs are absolutely thread bare. i am 5'6 and wear a size 28. they fit comfortably with great stretch, but apparently the fabric is so cheap that if your thighs should happen to touch, you will wear holes through the thighs in very short order.

first they started piling, which i had never a pair of pilcro pants do before, and within 2 washes i could actually see through the f",1
The jeans are even better in person. great fit and the color is nice. my new fave!,5
"Hesitant at first to spend so much on a swimsuit. definitely worth the money, quality all around..style..fit. appreciated the review i read prior to purchase, to size up! so happy i was able to get it on sale as well! $120.00 roughly but can see why it cost so much!",5
"Cloth & stone has to be one of the best brands at retailer! they consistently produce versatile, comfortable and quality pieces time and again. off the shoulder is back and here to stay, and without a doubt, this is one of the best i've tried on. the denim is a perfect, summery shade, but will transition well into fall with some darker denim or black jeans. i am 5'7, shoulders that are neither narrow nor broad, and a little busty - i got a size m and it fits great. i absolutely love my shir",5
"These jeans are perfect in every way. the rise is perfect, the stretch is perfect. we need more washes in this exact fit. i wish there was more consistency between pilcro denim washes of the same style!",5
"It stays on .... i mean off the shoulders. the price is shocking, love the low price, but by no means id cheap. really love this little beauty",5
"I purchased this dress while vacationing in florida and cannot wait for the midwest weather to warm up so i can wear it. i am tall (5'8"") and love how this dress fits me. i found the slip to work well with the dress and that it was not too sheer. the length was perfect, not too short in the front and just enough drape in the back. i love that the slip is attached so it lines up perfectly.",5
"I am short and curvy and pilcro has the best fitting, most comfortable and most cute jeans around. i buy exclusively pilcro now. these jeans were excellent.",5
"I love seafolly boyleg bathing suits. i find them very flattering and just universally appealing. this one has beautiful summery design as well. i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit. i normally wear size 6 (us size) of this suit, but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8(us) which fits perfect.",5
"I have been wearing joe's jean's for years and have a hefty stable of varieties in my wardrobe. recently, 3 pairs of their skinny leggings have worn out much quicker than expected which has caused me to question their construction and overall durability. i have had my eye on these pilco legging jeans for a while but every time i have gone to pull the trigger, my size has been sold out. finally, all the stars aligned just as i bid my final pair of joe's skinny's ""adieu"" and i was able to purchase",5
I love these jeans. they can be dressed up or dresses down. super cute with tall boots or loafers. i wear them all the time.,5
"Ok, so to be honest i just bought these two days ago so as far as wear and tear i'll have to get back to you on that but i seriously think i will just live in these. first they are so so comfortable, soft material, stretchy but not so thin that they accentuate every little curve but also very flattering. i'm 5'4"" 127 lbs, curvy in the bottom with a smallish waist and purchased size 28. there is a little bit of room, which i'm happy with, so they don't squeeze the love handle area or make it unco",5
"These jeans are really soft, comfortable, and flattering, but only after you go a size down. all the other pilcro jeans i've bought have been a consistent 30, but when i got these they were baggy. i exchanged them for a 29, and they were just the ticket.",5
"I cannot say enough excellent things about these jeans...they fit beautifully, have just enough stretch and sit high enough on my waist to cover any unsightly rolls. this was my first pilcro purchase, and i will definitely be adding other styles to my closet in the near future. typically, i'm a size 32 or 14 in denim, but i sized down to a 31 in these after the sales associate made that suggestion. i'm so glad i did...they are a perfect fit!",5
Ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality .,1
This dress is so pretty. the tulle underskirt was a fun surprise and the subtle striping in the dress so classy. the dress is true to size. my main concern was making sure the top part would fit around my chest. it fits perfectly.,5
I received this as a gift for my birthday in the navy blue and it fits great. i'm 5'2 and the petite medium was the perfect length.,5
I purchased this dress in the store and then realized i could get a petite size. i ordered it in a pm but had to return it. i reordered it in ps and it's perfect. i love it for a casual evening out of wearing around town in the summer. it's supper figure flattering.,5
"Gorgeous! this dress fit so well and it super flattering. i got it in green and the colors are just lovely. i had to get it hemmed because i'm short and i couldn't find it in petite, but definitely worth the extra cost. i love, love love it.",5
"The print on this is gorgeous, and it's incredibly comfortable. ultimately, i didn't buy it because the length was weird for me (i'm 5'7""); it just looked strange, like it was cutting me off at a weird point.",5
"I just purchased this adorable top at my local retailer store, not really expecting to find anything, i saw this one so i tried it on in my usual size small and it fit me perfectly (34d-27-35). i bought the black with the colorful print and think it's even prettier in person. it looks cute with the ties either open or closed and the material is nice and soft. also, the arm holes aren't too large which is always a nice plus:)",5
"I don't think it's possible to say enough good things about this dress! the fit is beautiful (i'm 5'6"", 130lbs, and am a 32h,) the material is soft and swishes around your legs in a delightful way, and the length has all the positives of a maxi dress without dragging on the ground. it doesn't show bra straps. it looks good with either heels or a trusty pair of birkenstocks. the pattern is fun. essentially, it's the perfect summer dress.",5
"I like this top. it provides a nice pop to the fall/winter dark wardrobe pieces. the picture gives off a blue hue, but the top is black, kind of a dusty black. the picture also gives the impression that the leaves are turquoise, but they're actually more green. at any rate, it is nice addition to my very dark winter wardrobe. i cannot wait to wear it with white denim like the model and something in the green family. i definitely recommend it.",5
"I love this dress! it is beyond flattering! i tried the south shore dress on earlier this year but found it too short for my taste. this however.. is the same cut on top, but longer in the skirt! yes, please! i purchased the turquoise, which is exactly as pictured! just beautiful! hits at my shins. for reference, i'm 5'6"", 136 lbs and ordered a size small.",5
"These jeans are great for the summer, they have a great high waist fit and stretch with you.  very very comfortable.  rinse is light making them a little casual but they can be dressed up with heels.  love them!",5
I normally don't care for rayon clothing but the fabric feels nice and it is flattering in the way it fits. i got my usual medium and it fits well. it has a nice drape and is not see through.,5
"As a teacher, it's so great to be able to find dresses that are modest and beautiful, that i can wear to work, as well as on the weekends.",5
"I bought the black and love it. i bought both the medium and large but am going to keep the medium. it was plenty roomy. i'm 5'2"" and about fluctuate between 125-130 lbs. i usually wear a medium or large in retailer-wear but i like things roomy. have to hide a little extra these days!",5
"I absolutely love this blouse! it's easily one of my favorite retailer finds in several seasons. it is quite roomy, so anyone hoping for a more form fitting cut won't find it here. this is the type of fit i prefer for summer though, as missouri is just disgustingly humid and i can't stand to wear anything clingy once it heats up. it's sheer, so a cami is required. it's also wrinkle prone, but the fabric is almost like a gauze and is not meant to be perfectly pressed and crisp. it's perfect to thro",5
Very flattering cut. only con is that is seems to snag easily. extremely comfortable and don;t need to wear a cami under it like i originally thought i would.,5
"Wow this dress is very flattering! i have a fairly small waist and not-so-small hips and this dress is slimming. it is also soft, light, airy, gorgeous! exactly what you need on a beautiful spring day! i wore this dress yesterday and have not felt that beautiful in a very long time! thank you so much retailer for the brilliant design:)",5
"Purchased this maxi dress in blue print, size petite xxsmall. even in that size i have some difficulty finding dresses that fit. but this one does perfectly. no complaints at all. length is a bit longer than pictured on model, but that's fine for a maxi summer easy style dress. i am quite short besides being petite so this fits the bill. am sure it will be worn quite often for many different occasions.",5
"This is such a darling velvet dress. understated, yet eye catching, i am very fond of it. the cut is flattering to all and the gathered fabric does not add bulk to the waist. there is a fun tulle underskirt to give just the right amount of volume. the straps creep ever so slightly toward being off shoulder, but fear not because there are loops and fasteners to hold your bra in place.

i am very thrilled to have found my holiday party dress so early and can't wait to wear it!",5
"This dress has a really elegant neckline combined with the wide fitted waist and under-the-bust gathers which really flatter the body. i have a fairly straight body and this dress gives me shape. i usually wear xspetite but the turquoise didn't come in petite and that was my preferred color. so i tried the xxs which i could barely get on and off but once on, it fit fine (34aa, 26"" waist, 34"" hips). i'd probably be better off with the xs. the length of the regular on me was fine, like a normal ma",5
"This dress is the perfect length and so comfortable! it's conservative enough to wear to work as a teacher but also so cute! i'm 5'6"" and the large hits right above my ankle. medium fit as well but i wanted a little extra room in the torso.",5
"I desperately needed some new work clothes, so i ordered this and a few other shirts online. this was the only one that fit me really well and that i really liked! it's a bit pricey for a tanktop, but it feels really well made. the material is soft and comfortable and the ruffle details and the print are beautiful. the small fits me perfectly (5'7"", 150 lbs, 36a) and it's not short like a lot of other shirts i try on, (which my coworkers probably appreciate since no one wants to see me flashing",5
"This was a bit of an impulse purchase but i'm glad i added it! it's a pretty standard tank, but is thoughtfully and well made. for example, the arm holes are not enormous like they are on some tops. i wish everything fit like this. the cut at the neckline isn't too modest or too low and the fold over of the drawstrings are structured enough that they don't flop over.",5
"I just received this in the mail and i was so surprised how flattering it is!  i ordered the print and i can see wearing this to work, out with friends or for date night!  perfect summer tank!  comfortable and flattering!  a great addition to my wardrobe! it fit true to size for me!",5
"This dress is gorgeous. flattering, comfortable, and machine washable!

for reference i am 5'5 145lbs, 38-30-40 and 34dd. i got the medium and it fits great! only flaw is that the armholes are a little large, but not enough that my bra shows so i am okay with it.",5
This dress is very comfortable. the fabric is really nice and the dress flows when you move. classic and pretty. i ordered a xs and i'm 5'3 135lbs 34b and the fit was great.,5
"I wanted this dress in the turquoise motif, but it sold out so quickly! i tried on about 10 dresses in my local store and this was the clear winner. i got the blue and white motif, which has enough visual interest with the way the pattern flows across the dress. i found the dress to be slimming and very comfortable. you can throw it on and not think about flashing anything when you bend over, or the skirt flying up in the breeze, or needing a strapless bra. the skirt flows really nicely and over",5
I saw this top and loved the pattern. meadow rue is one of my favorite brands for tops at retailer. the pattern is lovely and the fit it tts. this top is comfortable for running errands and can be dressed up too. very versatile for spring.,5
"This dress looks way better on you than sitting on the hanger! the design really flatters your body and the waist area, makes you look very skinny! highly recommend! the length is also perfect, just the right length for a maxi dress, long enough but short enough to show off your shoes as well!",5
No size fit me. i'm normally a s to m. the small had huge armholes on me and the xs was just a wee bit off somehow. perhaps in length. so i ended up without it sadly. it's really a very nice top and great quality. i was unhappy to leave it behind.,5
"I bought this in my usual size small, and love it. looks great with skinnies or pencil skirts. not sheer enough to need a cami, but enough to look cottony and breezy. very elegant. it falls flatteringly on my shape - 34c, 28-38, 5'3"". it has an elegant, arty vibe. if you have a long torso or big chest, i would say try it on in the store to make sure the chest area falls well for you.",5
"Got this dress in the blue and cream and it's gorgeous. i love that it's work and date night appropriate, but so comfy. i am 5'4"" but have very short legs, so it's hard to find a maxi dress or skirt that doesn't drag on the ground. this floats beautifully above my ankles - a little lower than on the model, but still high enough that i am totally comfortable wearing the dress without heels. i got the small and it fits great. the print is lovely - the cream fabric is speckled in gray dots in some",5
"I have this in darker blue and it is my favorite dress of the season. i didn't realize that there was one in turquoise until it was already sold out. please bring back or be so kind to contact me if an xs comes in as a return, etc. 
i love this so much!",5
"The turquoise print is absolutely stunning. i love the feel of the fabric, the drape",5
"I hesitated to spend the money on this sweater but somehow knew it would be my go-to sweater for the season. when i tried it on, i knew i made the right decision - it feels luxurious and fits like a dream. the pop of color on the pocket is perfect to make a statement and to add something different from all those other sweaters! the fit is tts.",5
This dress is more adorable on then sitting on the hanger. the material clings to all the right places and feels really good. i must say this is one of the most comfortable dresses i have ever put on. would never tell from the photo that this dress is so adorable. if you like a fitted dress in the waist and bust that subtly accentuates your curves - try it. adorable!,5
Sticker price was a shock but it is so worth it. it is the best little black dress i have ever owned. the lace is so soft and the dress is flattering. it is fun and flirty. this is a closet staple piece for sure!!! love this dress so much!,5
I really love this shirt and bought it in several colors. i wish it came in white and in black because it's a great basic. i think it also works well for business casual attire.,5
Great trouser pants for summer with pretty jacquard print and neat denim detail at hem and waist band. usually wear a 6 in retailer but went up a size to 8 with these for looser trouser fit. fits my backend nicely which is always a plus. can't wait to wear them!,5
"I spotted these on the sale rack and loved the design, the almost regal fabric toned down to casual by the cropped denim cuffs. they weren't my size, but, to my surprise they could be ordered in my size, still at the sale price.
the fit was perfect. they will surely make a statement wherever i choose to wear them.",5
"I'm always on the lookout for pieces that look polished, but aren't fussy. this is *that* blazer. i'm rather petite and bought the xs, though wish they had the petite in store to try on as xs is not very fitted on my frame. the perfect weight for 65 degree summer days.",5
"So so cute. i am 5' 7"" 150-155lbs and the 10 fit me perfectly. i expected the m or 10 to be too small. wore them the first day i received them. i have a large waist 34"". hips about 39"" and the 10 fits great, not tight. love the material and the workmanship is tops. i think they are a great buy especially on sale. wore them with a hei hei jacket also on sale, can't get much better.",5
I bought the blue and it is beautiful. it definitely runs small and i agree with the other reviewer who stated to order 2 sizes up.,5
"These are simply the best of everything i love about charlie trousers. great fit, classic styling with the pop of the unexpected. the fabric is thinner than it appears--perfect for spring and summer. the pattern of the damask is not overwhelming, but it works very well as a neutral if you want to mix patterns (which i do a lot), or if you want to pair it with an ivory blouse and a simple blue sweater or jacket.. roll down the pants for a more professional look during the day, roll them up for ca",5
"Wearing these for the first time today. the way the pants are made is the way a pair of quality pants should be. the fabric is gorgeous; the fit is excellent. the tone on tone flower is subtle but visible and creates a lovely pattern. the denim treatment at the ankle and waistband is a nice added touch. true to size, too. these are not your run of the mill above the ankle pants - they're something special and worth the money...the fact that i did get them on sale makes it an even better purchase",5
Love this t. i now have all the colors. it is so soft and comfortable. great with jeans or dressed up with leggings and boots. and when i feeling lazy i just keep it on and use it as a night shirt to sleep in. it's that comfortable! i found the size to be spot on.,5
"The deep v doesn't gape, and flatters the neckline, while the waist-high side slits reveal enough to keep this drapey shirt from looking shapeless. the material is so lovely and soft and comfy, but clings in the right places to really flatter, while problem areas get draped in the most perfect way.",5
"Love these jeans as they look great with dress shoes, running shoes or boots. fit well and true to size.",5
"This jacket doesn't look all that special in the photos provided. i found it at my local store and i knew it was mine the moment i tried it on. it has that boxy shoulder look i associate with 80s power suits. i call this look: ""full sigourney weaver"" and it is marvelous! perfect for a lunch date with harrison ford circa 1988. so happy with this purchase. highly recommend!",5
"I received the pants and they are really nice. you can dress them up or down. i ordered a size 0 in regular and they did not fit me well around my thighs, as they were loose. i will have to return them as they do not have my size in petites. i am a size 0 in petites and ordered the size 0 in regular. the only downside to the pants was it was hard to undo the buttons and found it rather difficult.",5
I just picked this up in store the other day! i absolutely love it! it is so easy to throw on real quick for a cute outfit.,5
"My first review and first full price designer denim purchase....

i recently lost weight and in need to replace all my pants and in search of a dark wash high rise jeans (preferably in black), finally decided to buy this at full price online coz of all the fab reviews. i decided to purchase the 25p, thinking that i may return after receiving it in the mail since i wasn't able to try at the store and not sure if i got the right size, also it's not the high rise denim that i was looking for. but t",5
"I was looking for a pair of ankle jeans to wear with booties. i love my regular length paige hoxton jeans but they are too long me (5'4"" 120) if i want to wear booties. i decided to try the petite size and.... perfecto!!! just the right length and the rest of the fit was just like my other paige jeans. i love when you can count on sizing to stay true across styles.",5
"1. this looks so cute on the model, doesn't it? i have no idea where you wear a suit with hot pants, but it looks cute.

2. that said, keep in mind the model is probably 6 feet 10 inches tall. i'm 5 feet 6 inches tall, and this jacket came down to my knees. i'm not kidding. the 3/4 length sleeves were at my wrist, so more like 7/8 sleeves.

3. i'm normally a size 12 in cartonnier jackets, but this only comes s, m or l. the medium is really a size 10, which was too tight across the shoulders and",1
"Cute shirt, it looked big so i ordered a size smaller. worked fine. would have liked the option to go even smaller so i would suggest ordering down. ultimately too baggy on my frame so sending back. fun shirt though!",5
"Love this top. it is exactly as pictured online. it's a beautiful coral pink color - perfect for summer (i think the description says ""red"" but it is definitely pink). i love the swiss dot material, the bell sleeves, the ruffled bottom. they all work perfectly together to make for an adorable top. it almost seems as if it can be worn off the shoulder, due to the elastic neckline, but i prefer it on, as pictured on the model. 

the fit is tts. i ordered an xs and that is what i usually wear fro",5
"I loved this jacket when i tried it on in the store, and brought home a size med. it's a nice weight of material, lined, and very classy. i liked the idea of adding it to my collection of suit-jackets for business meetings. but when i tried it on again using actual outfits from my closet, i realized how much it looked like a lab-coat. i am not giving up-- if it goes on sale, i'll order a small, to see if it is more flattering. but at this point, it's a no-go.",5
Hands-down one of the more comfortable shirts i've purchased from retailer.,5
"Feels great, flows nicely, and love the pockets that hide pretty much everything from a lipstick container to a phone.",5
"When i spotted these online i knew i had to try them out! in the past charlie pants have always been too baggy in the legs for me when trying the regular sizes on in the store. well, these are described as 'slim, tailored' in details, so decided to order my usual size 6 regular. upon arrival, they were baggy in the thigh area, the rise was fine but the crotch area -pardon me- was a little on the short side. buttons were difficult to slip into the buttonhole & unbuttoning was a job! guess the hol",5
"Always get compliments when i wear these pants (my mom has the exact same pants and loves them too). they are great for work and transitioning to go out after. i like my pants tight, but these run a little small.",5
"Excellent dress. usually i wear a oop, and this did fit great. a little snug in the chest (im a 32c), but the buttons are covered by material so it doesnt show. the waist hits perfectly. there is the right amount of skirt material to make a dramatic silhouette without looking silly. awesome dress! wish the blue or white with icecream were still available! the hot pink is a wonderful summer color though.",5
"I got this i n regular xs (i am xsp or xxsp), so it fit fine considering is boxy. it is very cute and delicate so despite being casual, it gives a nice ""dress-up"" kick to any jeans, shorts, capris. im very happy with this top and like it very much and definitely recommend it to everybody. just be careful since is delicate
:-)",5
"This dress is very versatile. it is comfortable and very flattering. the armholes were not too big. you do need to wear a bra that crosses in the back if you do not want the straps to show. i purchased the red/pink color and it is very vibrant and not see through at all. the length is great as it is above the knee by a few inches, it accentuates the best part of the leg. it also can be dressed up with heels and jewelry or more casual with flatter shoes. it is a classic style, not trendy so it wi",5
This top looks great and feels great. got lots of compliments when i wore it for thanksgiving. i pretty plan to wear this for every holiday event this year and will layer it with sweaters and scarves to mix it up.,5
"This dress is everything i imagined it would be. lightweight, flattering on my hourglass shape, and comfortable. i am a true 4p in retailer dresses (5'4"" 32d, 27 inch waist, 28 denim size) and purchased this dress in a 6 regular. i imagine the petite size would be way too short, as the regular size hit about 3 inches above my knee. might be a problem for taller girls. definitely size up on this one to avoid button gaping.",5
"Love this top.
the fit is perfection!
the fabric is wonderfully soft.
i ordered the green, love this color.
will be ordering it in the grey also..
fits very true to size.",5
"After reading the reviews, i was a little afraid of the fit before the dress arrived, having ordered it online. it is a darling dress. i am big busted (36d) and it fit just fine. also, it has an cute attached slip, so i didn't find it see through. the color is gorgeous, i chose the blue, and it will be perfect for summer. no problem at all with the armholes!",5
This cover-up is perfect for the beach or the pool. it is see through.,5
"Normally, hd in paris brand is spot on for their dresses. this dress is a big thumbs down. as most of these reviewer's and myself point out, the large arm holes do not allow you to wear a regular bra because you don't just get a peak of your bra, you get to see the whole side of it. secondly, the bust of the dress would work only for an a-cup bra, too small for the average woman. the only bright spot with this dress is the brilliant colors available and the quality of the fabric itself - excelle",1
"This dress fulfills a gap in my wardrobe that i've long wanted to fill: that of the perfect springtime dress. i got the sky blue color in a size 4 (for reference, i am 120 lbs and 34-26-37) and it fits like a glove. the color is vivid and the overall effect of the dress is simple and romantic. i'll be wearing it with casual cognac sandals, a floppy straw hat, and minimal makeup.",5
"I wore this dress to an outdoor farm wedding and it was perfect. it runs small (i'm 5'5"" 125lbs with 34c bust) and i got a size 6. i tried on blue and pink, both were great but the blue won me over. it wrinkles easily so i had to use an iron on low to medium beforehand. will wear many more times!",5
I had bought the pull over in the same fabric and now this zipper jacket style. so fun and love the texture. i waited for markdown plus promo and it was worth waiting.,5
"Tried this on just for fun today and ended up taking it home in the glorious blue. many have commented on the sizing issue. for reference i am 5'5, 120 lbs, 32a, slender athletic build. i bought a size 2 and it fits like a dream. no large arm holes, no gaping buttons  and the length is perfect. yes it will wrinkle, it's linen. that's part of the look. i feel this will fill a void in my closet that was missing. i was wearing flat ankle wrap espadrilles when i tried it on and it looked super cute.",5
"Adorable top! sweet but not too sweet, can go either casual or dressy depending on what it is paired with. i was looking for cropped tops as that silhouette works better for my proportions with the plethora of cropped bottoms that are in stores. as another reviewer mentioned, it is lined so no cami is necessary. the label says dry clean only however, i have washed it in a mesh bag on gentle in cold water and hung to dry without any issues. the dry cleaning warning may be because of the lace on t",5
"I have to be honest, i wear this away from the pool more than to the pool. it is extremely lightweight and comfortable, making it the perfect loungewear to tackle this california heat, and the style is fabulous- love the hassles and beads on the ties.",5
"Great fit, easy to dress up or down, lovely shade of blue--this will be my default dress this summer.",5
"Always looking for sweaters that are wearable in south florida, stumbled upon this gem. from the front gorgeous silvery gray, soft sweater and stunning open back with romantic silky black bow details. bows will hide bra easily underneath. so comfortable, classy and sexy.",5
My friend and i bought the same dress we love it so much we get so many compliments great purchase,5
"I have had my little eye on this dress since it came out! lucky me i found it sitting pretty in my local retailer lost   found! it runs a tad big, when i first tried it on with the sleeves off-the-shoulder i was disappointed in the length (past my knees); but i tried it on again with the sleeves sitting on my shoulders ... so so darling",5
This is a beautiful blue color and a fun swing design. it is very short so will be limited with what you can wear it with. looks very cute with higher waisted jeans and pencil skirts. it is wide but has a lovely flow/swing to it. love the fabric and it is a nice change to everyday style in wardrobe. so if you want something fun and flirty and feminine and you do not mind short this is your top.,5
"I purchased these pants on-line in my usual size petite 4 and they were a perfect fit for me. i have a 27"" waist, 35"" hips and i'm 5'4"" and found them to be a little long but not so much that i want to hem them as i'll be wearing these with my clogs and platforms anyway. if i want to be able to wear them with flats, i'll need to hem them but i bought them to go with my higher shoes so it's no bother. these are very slimming pants and zip up at the back. they are a tad difficult to zip up but not",5
"I bought this for an event, and when it arrived, i realized it was probably too dressy for my event. there are some large sparkly clusters of ""stones"" that are beautiful, but do make the dress more cocktail attire than i needed. if i had something to wear it to, i would keep it in a heartbeat. the fit is flattering and the quality is reminiscent of old school retailer pieces. there are cups already in the bodice, which is a huge plus imo. it's unique and beautiful!",5
"This is a full swing top. because the top is so full, it should hit at or slightly above the waist (and it does on me) so that a pant or skirt waistline can be seen and balance out the proportions. will look great with a pencil skirt or any pant that as a mid or high rise fitted waist and flat front (no pleats or draw string, for example). the fabric has weight and hangs nicely. color is true to photos. easy way to look a little dressier during summer. 5'3"" 120lb 34b - small regular fit me perfe",5
"I love the weight of this dress, the mod color blocking, the pockets, the detail down the side of the skirt, the cable knit, everything! i wear it with a caramel cardigan and brown booties, it's perfect. it's a sin to pass it up, especially for this price.",5
"Maeve once again created another beauty! love, love, love. i purchased the crocheted cape in cream and have received numerous compliments on the dress. get it while it lasts! i typically wear a 4-6 in maeve and got the 6 in this one.",5
"I have a closet full of dresses and very few have the quality and attention to detail as this gorgeous dress!
often times when ordering online the dress that you actually receive will have a different fabric placement than the online photos.......and it can detract from the overall look.....but the one that i received is exactly as pictured. the gold details hit in all the right places.
the quality is shocking! looks like a $2000 dress.
true to size however, the chest/bust runs a little big.",5
"From the online pics, i would never think to try this on, but i was looking for a shirtdress with pockets, so glad i did! i purchased in green and navy... i love the neck line when buttoned up, almost military jacket'ish and i like the idea of wearing over jeans and a shirt and leaving unbuttoned almost like a light layer or jacket. super soft material... i purchased a size 6 and i am 5'9 and 140 lbs.",5
I love this top. the design is beautiful and the fit is flattering. it's so pretty. the top has great movement and pairs well with so many things. the top hits somewhere around my waist but wasn't too short. i highly recommend this top.,5
I love this dress! it has pockets in front. timeless. fun. dress up or down.,5
Material is heavy enough to provide warmth on a crisp day or evening.  add poncho or large warm scarf to keep colder temps @ bay. sure wish this came in blk. i bought mauve & just love it!,5
"I'm 5'10"", 140lbs and this dress fits exactly like shown on the model. hits right above my knees in front and an inch or so below my knees in the back. i didn't find it to be too blousey at all. i'm more pear shaped so i like that this is flowey around my hips and bum. purchased a size 6 and it fits well over my chest and arms. if you're busty or have muscular arms i can see how this might feel more restrictive. great staple to my wardrobe!",5
Awesome flares and very flattering! a wardrobe staple!,5
"I just scored this dress the other day and i don't regret it for a second. the bodice is beaded with some sea-foam green beads and they are sewn on really well, so i am not worried about dropping them all night. from the pictures, i couldn't tell if this was going to look like a cotton skirt or i fit would be chiffon looking-it is neither. it has a shimmer to it which makes this a more dressy looking dress than i was originally anticipating-i thought it was going to be an everyday wear type of d",5
This is my new favorite top! it's so comfortable and looks great. i wish i could order it in more colors!,5
"I love this top! its so comfortable and light weight! it drapes beautifully, with an overall loose fit but a little slimmer at the bottom. so flattering! i only wish i bought them in every color before they ran out!",5
"I loved this top when i first saw it. i tried on my usual size l, and there is no stretch through the bust, so it totally flattened my chest. a few weeks ago i noticed there were some xl's that must have been returned. i tried them on and they fit perfectly! i suggest sizing up if you have a chest, this is a very flattering top and it looks great paired with scarves as a wrap, skinny jeans and boots.",5
Got this shirt in black so i can wear it to work.  more personality than a plain t-shirt but still comfortable.  got lots of compliments.,5
"Button down shirts usually aren't my thing, but the soft fabric of this top makes it feminine and comfortable while still keeping that classic look. it's also easy to dress up or down, which is great! i am 5'4"" and small-framed, and the size 0 fits just right.",5
"This top is super comfy and easy to wear. i found it to be a bit darker tan than it looks online, but still quite cute. it's flowy but still gives you shape, overall it was a great buy.",5
"I ordered the ""london, paris, milan"" print red top in a size 4. i go back and forth with ordering 2's and 4's but i figured that with long sleeves, i'd rather have a little room than it be fitted. my boyfriend asked if i bought it for valentine's day- the red print and the cities struck him as romantic. anyway, lovely top. lightweight material will be nice for layering during winter, and wearing on it's own in spring and next fall.",5
"The perfect tee. this is exactly what i have been looking for. flattering fit,looks great dressed up or down and has just a touch of unique detail without being over the top, the top is just slightly thin but can definitely be worn without a cami underneath. this reminds me of old retailer tops from several years ago that i just loved and wore to death.",5
"The photo doesn't do it justice. the detail on the neckline is adorable and looks fantastic with jeans. texture is light and gauze-y, but i don't find it too see-though. sizing was tough- i'm 5'10 but thin on top- usually between xs & s, and went with the xs on this (ordered both to try), sacrificing some length for a more flattering width. great for the sale price!!!",5
This is a great blouse for all shapes!   you can wear it under a suit or with jeans!,5
"Super soft and super chic! this sweater wrap looks great at the mall, at church, and even just curling up with a hot drink on a cold day at home. i'm still in love with this after a year!",5
Received this product with a gaping hole in it. very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse,1
So unflattering! really disappointed. made me look 6 month pregnant and i'm a petite size 2.,1
I love this top!  it does run big and maybe some won't like it with the elastic waist.  i think it's the perfect weight and very comfortable.  i love the detail around the neck line.,5
Soft fabric and hangs nicely. washes well. purchased in the orange /red and love with jeans.,5
"I really loved this top. however, i couldn't get it on. i tried on a medium (my usual size.) it's not that it was too small. something else is wrong with it. the large was way too big. too bad, i really wanted this look.",1
"This shirt looked cute until i tried it on... worst fit ever. im thin, and this style of top is usually quite flattering, but this one missed the mark big time.",1
"This is not your traditional moth sweater, in that, it is not soft and cozy. this sweater is great for upcoming summer nights at the beach while fireside or out on the boat! i haven't been the biggest fan of the lace up trend but this one is more traditional nautical feeling than others which i did like. it's pretty true to size, so i wouldnt size up or down for any reason. they paired it with a cloth + stone white button down underneath at our store and it looks great layered too!",5
"This shirt is very comfortable to wear, mostly because the buttons are well placed. many button down shirts bother me because they gape open at the bust area, but the buttons on this one are placed at just the right spot.",5
"Fabric is soft,cool and comfortable. love the sleeves as air circulates. this is perfect for new wide legs i purchased. many compliments and purchase inquiry when worn. purchased in two colors.",5
Love the detailing around the neck of this top looks great under cardigan or by itself. i sized down to an xs. seems to be of good quality although to lengthen its life i don't plan on putting it in the dryer :),5
"Bought this size small and orange. needed something to where home, beautiful, comfortable, light and airy, paired it with retailer's manella stack pendant necklace, even better. received alot of compliments, the color stood out.",5
"I love this blouse! i get so many compliments when i wear it. i can't wait for warmer weather to pair it with my coral short skirt from retailer. currently, i wear it with a pair of slim cream colored pants, and flats. it works great! it is a little on the short side, but it just adds to the tailored look of the cut. however, if you're taller than 5'5"" or 5'6"", i would expect it to be much shorter on you (you've been warned ;)
overall, this is a great addition to your wardrobe, and it washes nicel",5
"I bought this top for work and going out.  it is a beautiful top that goes with many items in my closet like my red blazer, grey blazer, red cardigan etc.  it is very flattering.  the arm holes weren't too big.  fit tts.",5
"I love this shirt so much i bought it (nearly) full price with my birthday month discount!
get it! i purchased the red and also like the black/white polka dots - hangs beautifully,
feels heavenly and polished and fun at the same time. i bought the medium am generally
a medium.",5
"This blouse is exactly what i wanted and the fit is great. silk is always light, and can go with jeans or dress up with a skirt. i'm wearing mine to a baby shower in a few weeks.",5
"So beautiful! fabric hangs great, lovely detail, fits well and feels great",5
"These pants are adorable. i am a petite lady with a small waist and have a hard time finding pants that fit and look good, but these do. they are both cute and elegant. and they have pockets. i have had many compliments. the one drawback is they need dry cleaning.",5
I could live in these. they are so comfy. i typically wear a 6 and got the medium. they are a little roomy. probably could have gotten a small..but i like them kinda loose and baggy. i will probably purchase another color!,5
This body suit is super flattering and super comfortable. i'll probably order it in the other color.,5
I love this! the contrast in much prettier in person.,5
"I was skeptical about buying a romper. i was also unsure what size would fit me (i'm 5'5"" and 150 lbs.)  to my delight, the romper fit perfectly! it's a gorgeous and flattering fit.  i love the design and fabric!  it's stunning!",5
"Bought the tan/taupe joggers today in asheville. so soft and comfy, will probably go back for navy ones. i found them true to size. will be a great, cute addition to my summer wardrobe.",5
"I have these pants in the blue/grey color and like them so much i got them in olive. wash well, fit perfectly... easy to throw on and look great!!",5
"The shirt can be a little boxy, so make sure to order your size! the peplum is a great length in the back.",5
I am always looking for a shirt that's a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt (running after a 1 year old i need comfort). i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple (which i think it said was blue for some reason). the material is nice and the cut is feminine.,5
"This dress is an absolute attention getter. it's incredibly unique, and fits beautifully. i'm very short, and often have problems pulling off this much pattern, but this dress was just right.",5
"I saw this at the store today. very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through! from what i could see on my body, it would have been too short in the crotch. i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely. i gave up. cute shade of green though.",1
Love this dressed up casual tshirt. perfect casual friday shirt or going out for happy hour with the girls.,5
Super flattering and lovely material. dress-up or down. they run true to size.,5
"I was lucky to get these on sale with free shipping(my major lucky shopping moment of the year); however, they are worth every penny of the full price. i've waited years before shelling out this much for a pair of nice jeans, but now my skeptical opinion has done a 180 turn. these paige verdugo ultra skinny jeans are superior to any denim i've ever tried. they look and feel fabulous on me. i bought my usual 29/size 6 and am 5'1"", 130#.",5
"Saw on my way out of the store and had to try them on. they are very comfortable and surprisingly cute. the jogger style usually doesn't flatter my curvier body but these have a drape to the fabric that made them look so much nicer. i took in two sizes, my usual small and a medium since i just had my second child and still have some post baby weight. i still went with the small after trying on both though. the medium was a bit too big and shapeless. the small was comfortable and looked better. t",5
Today i happened to walk into my favorite store with an already reduced 30percent off sale sign. i tried on this pants and let me tell you-wow!! they are super comfy and made my behind look great!! i will definitely start wearing these asap!!,5
"Velvet always has made quality clothing and i had purchased the same shirt in another color and i wanted to see if they had other colors, they did and i got 2 more. i received in expected time and they were wrapped nicely. thank you for great choices of unique clothing.",5
"Ordered the biggest size available, the large. the arms are so tight, i couldn't get it on. looked like it may have fit in the body so i don't understand why so constricting in the arms. i don't have big arms, either. fabric is thin but the color is pretty. can't recommend. i'd pass on this one.",1
"I was looking for something to wear on jeans fridays. this tunic is super cute and looks great with jeggings. i did find the sizing small for me, but i am busty.",5
This jacket is high quality leather and will bring you years of wear! i made sure to add a little room to accommodate thick sweaters!,5
"Received this jacket today and i am so very impressed with the details. initially when i ordered this jacket i first thought the navy blue waffle fabric was a corduroy or velvet, but it is a plain cotton blended fabric with unfinished edges that has the denim attached to it. the plus is the inside breast pocket that is trimmed so nicely and lined, and fits a nice sized phone. the inside is lined and even the sleeves are lined . there is pretty cream lace trim on the inside bottom of the lining i",5
"These pants are very cute for spring/summer, and i enjoy having the option of a looser silhouette with a bit of length (nearly all of my pants are a cropped skinny these days!). i agree with the other reviews that have described the leg as being less straight-legged than they are pictured. on me, they have a subtle flare -- nothing major, but just enough to break perfectly over my shoe. they fit tts on me, but i did need to have the hem taken up. i'm 100 lbs, 5'0 and the 0p fits perfectly. i hav",5
"Bought this dress to wear for my engagement brunch! it does run big, but it's a laid back dress to wear?i never had to adjust the dress of myself while wearing it.",5
"First, let me say that the photo does not do this exquisite print justice! the fabric is worth framing! on a white ground, the tones of rose, pink, purple and touches of blue make it even more fabulous! the fit is a tad large, as i am 5' 3"" and usually an size 6, but must size up to 8 or m because of my chest. even zipped, it is a tad big, but nothing that i cannot deal with. i don't really see the swing in the dress, as it does not flare out in any way, but is certainly is loose and flowing, bu",5
"Like other reviewers, found leg more flared/straight than pictured. i wore all day at work (desk job) and didn't see any wrinkling.",5
"I bought these pants on a whim while i was at my local retailer. i was so delighted after trying them on because i've never tried on a pair of linen pants that i actually liked. they definitely have more of a flair leg rather than straight leg like the picture suggests. i wore them for several hours at a party and they didn't stretch that much on me. i agree with the other review in that they do get a little wrinkly but not much more than what i would expect from linen fabric. i'm 5'3"" so t",5
"So i bought this, even after seeing the other reviews. because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different. this fits just as others describe. it was not flattering to me at all, 5""2. had to go back.",1
"Very cute and comfortable!does run big, i used the size chart and it's very generous-would order down a size next time.",5
"I immediately picked out this in the taupe color at the store. the black was pretty basic looking, but this color is gorgeous. it's quite flowy on me (i wear an xs/s most places but usually small in tops here) the sleeves stretched out a bit after a day of teaching too. one of my favorite tops at retailer right now!",5
"This jacket is amazing! i at first bought the medium because that is what i usually wear on top. when it arrived in the mail i put it on asap. it fit but was definitely too form fitting to wear a sweater or long sleeve shirt underneath. so i called the store and asked them to reserve a large and that one fit perfectly! it's loose enough to wear something underneath but not so loose that it looks to big. it is so soft and cozy, and the hood is my favorite part!",5
I tossed this in my bag (online) at the last minute thinking i'd give it a shot. so glad i did. this is dress is so simple and so much more flattering then i expected. you can dress it up or down. i wish it was about 1/2 inch longer but still a good length for me (things are always too short for me). the material could be a little thicker but then i suppose it would lose the bounce that is so key to the flow of thing with this dress.,5
"I love these pants! super comfy - fit well and a great color. i knew immediately when i put them on that i would love them. and the button fly? to die for. 
wore them and they did stretch out a bit by the end of the day but they didn't look awful and super baggy. i bought the other color in a size smaller so they might be better. a great pant for summer!",5
"This sweater feels good and not itchy at all. i'm long waisted and the small hit right at my hip bone/top of my low-waisted jeans, so it's kinda on the shorter side. i liked it that way, bc it's not baggy at the bottom and is figure flattering. i tied the tie twice and thought it looked better. i have long arms and was excited the sleeves go down to the middle of my hands. it has little hole detailing down the middle, but not so much that you'd have to wear a shirt underneath.",5
I love these socks! they are super thick and comfy. the quality feels great and they were cheap!,5
This is s very comfortable cami with comfortable and nicely designed straps in back.,5
"If you're like me and wish you could carry on downtown boho dressing when the time to take out your puffer comes to pass, this tunic is essential. though the silky alpaca-wool knit is thicker than gauzy cotton, it drapes just as well and keeps one's self warm and cozy without the bulk of a sweater. i was concerned with the elastic banding at the bottom of the tunic because i'm only 5'4"", but high-waisted, and banded hems tends to always hit me at the wrong spot. luckily, it's not very binding, s",5
"I can't stop rubbing the faux fur. faux fur can be cheap and tacky but this looks and feels beautiful. it has two hook and eyes and comes with a third which i used to add another hook on top, above my bust. its roomy so size down if you want it fitted. i'm 5'1"" and 120 with a 34 c bust and a short torso and i got a small. i could have worn the xs but i like the fact that the small allows for a good weight cashmere sweater underneath without feeling tight. the hood is the best part. it's so drama",5
This was my first mother denim purchase and i've already gotten another color. love the feel of this denim. it's heavy enough to smooth out any imperfections and manages to stay tight (not stretch out) while being comfortable. this color is perfect too. so flattering. love!!,5
"Simple, classic, figure flattering, and reasonably priced!",5
Dress is much different in person. thin ribbed cotton.  a little tight for xl.    it looks like a throw back dress from contempos.  returned and would not recommend,1
"This is a great top, not cheap but funky! it would look nice on any figure. the two blacks on my top are more alike than the picture shows. great value for a pretty party top - but it can go anywhere!",5
"Love this top! it is almost universally flattering, and washes beautifully. it is as easy as throwing on a sweatshirt with leggings, but soooo much better! if you are on the fence on this one, i highly recommend you give it a try.",5
"I love everything about these pants- the color, the fit, the detail. oh, and these have a button fly. i didn't realize that when i ordered them, but i love it. i haven't had a pair of button fly pants in so long. these have a nice stretch to them as well. hei hei knows what they're doing. and i got them on sale. thank you retailer!!",5
"This actually might be my favorite thing that i have ever owned.  the jacket is so beautiful and so cozy jacket. i agree that the pics do not do this amazing piece justice.  for reference, i am 5'7 140 lbs and bought the large to allow a bit of room for layering.",5
This jacket is so adorable on! i have no idea why retailer styled it with a chunky cream turtleneck under it considering the jacket is also cream and it's hard to tell what it even looks like?! i've been searching for a coat like this to give my leather jacket a break. in my opinion a lot of the faux coats look like they have cheap itchy material. this definitely does not! it is super soft and the faux fur is of high quality. the inside is also lined and feels like a very thick soft jersey sweater,5
"I tried this shirt on in store, and loved it! it has a flattering fit and is very comfortable. i read some other reviews about the quality not being good, i don't feel that way at all. the knit and the silky/satiny materials both feel like quality to me. the one concern i have is that it may wrinkle easily. i'm 5'4'' and 125lbs and the xs fits well. i plan to pair it with skinny jeans.",5
Very comfortable to sleep in. doesn't bunch up or twist. love this.,5
Very cute!! true to size,5
Have kept my eyes out for a jacket like this for several years now. and this one is more than i had hoped for.  in the store i was between a l and m.  so went with the large.  after getting home and trying on a couple more times i decided to order the petite large.  jacket is roomy warm and so so soft.  added bonus w the hood.,5
Got them on sale in blue and love the color! they are flattering and i like the waist and pocketed area bc it is also comfy- waistband and hips are loose but not too loose. tts. i'm 8/10 and took a 29.,5
"Love these pants. very figure flattering and fabric stretch holds up well. no sag at end of day. i am 5'6.5"" and size 6 hits ankle bone. i love these so much i went to order a second pair and size 6 sold out so i ordered an 8 . will see how a size bigger works. i think may give a looser look but be comfy. so happy to have these. wear with booties and my tunics, peasant blouses and much more. highly recommend.",5
Great color and shape for all seasons. i was so elated to get this piece on sale! love it!,5
"How has nobody reviewed these pants yet?! love them! they're more like really nice, structured leggings, but thick enough to be substantial pants. they're stretchy, hold their shape, flattering on my big hips and thighs, and have no distracting elements like belt loops or protruding pockets like some of my other pants, which makes it hard to keep a smooth silhouette under a longer shirt. the only bad--and it wasn't even really that bad--is that these are longer than the 27"" advertised. i'm 5'5"",",5
"Just as nice and comfortable, except this one ahs the bonus of being able to pair wit different tops...too bad i ahve the dress in the same color!

"Maybe the softest sweater that i own. buy it, and you won't regret it!",5
"I was recently asked to be a speaker at an important fundraising event for homeless & abused women in our city. i wanted to appeal to the affluent crowd by my physical presentation, and let my words follow with a heartfelt presentation of the value & worth of these precious ladies.

retailer has continually helped me present polished & professional, yet still show my personal style & inclusive nature.

it gives me that extra edge of authenticity & encouragement to do the most w/what has",5
"I highly recommend this dress!!!!!! i was a little nervous about purchasing this dress online because previous reviewers were saying that it creates static, but nothing that a little static guard couldn't prevent! :) i purchased a medium petite and i am about 5 feet tall, usually a size 8 in dresses and it fit perfect! (wore for thanksgiving) the fabric and style are very forgiving and the dress sort of flows with you when you walk, which i love!!",5
"I was so pleasantly surprised when i received this in the mail, because it's much more substantial than i thought it would be. it's perfect for fall and spring and the lining is very soft. i thought it'd be more difficult to wear but it goes well with everything! i ordered my usual size small and am happy with the fit.",5
"I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo, but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end",1
"This dress is very flattering on and can easily be dressed up or down. i was nervous it might be too flowy, but it lays very nice and is so pretty on!",5
"Was in my local retailer today and just had to try this on! it appeared to be a structured jacket, but it is actually a sweater-jacket! gives a very ""chanel"" vibe and looks so chic. i plan on wearing it with just about everything. i would probably wear it open most times, but i love the closure with the button detail. i am large busted, but petite, 119 lbs., 5'2"", and this was way more flattering on me than most jackets. normally, the sleeves are too long, but these were just right! i am sure i wi",5
"I love my new blazer! the material is very soft and comfortable, and very nice quality, but not too ""wooly"" to wear into spring. the cut is very flattering, and the patterns and fringe details are very eye-catching. i am 5'6"" and usually wear a size s in retailer and this small fit perfectly. they grey/cream color combo is gorgeous and looks very versatile, and can be dressed up or down.

the one alteration i suggest is moving the button; at the shoulder it gives a wide boxy shape. my tailor wil",5
"I wear size 8 , ordered a medium, fits great. nice quality, like that you can wear open or buttoned at the shoulder.",5
If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade,1
"I can?t describe my love for this sweater! simple, to go outfit paired with jeans and boots, it?s an easy go-to sweater in a pinch on a cold day. i have sensitive skin, so i wore a tank underneath and was fine. loved getting this sweater with the extra 40% sale price! i purchased the medium (2) and it was tts.",5
"I absolutely love this pullover and am so glad i purchased it. it is the perfect weight for fall/winter, super soft, true to size. the diamond shape opening in back looks great with my strappy yoga bras, i have received compliments every time i wear it. i am 6', 144lb, slim/athletic build and often have trouble with sleeve length. this however is perfect & i can use the thumb holes as designed without stretching the sleeves in an awkward way. wish it came in more colors!",5
So great! soft and a great sweater but still gives you a shape to your body.,5
"This is the perfect top. it is adorable, and the fit and cut of it is forgiving.",5
"I have received so many compliments on this top from both men and women. it is so comfortable and cute, i never want to take it off. :p",5
"I was so excited when i ordered this, i love comfy clothing this looked perfect! when i received it, there was a weird smell with the top. convinced that this could be from storage or something, i washed it. the smell did not go away. i have washed it 3 times now and the smell will not disappear! i have not yet worn but as i have washed it, not able to return it. the top looks and feels great - just the weird smell. now i am 'stuck'!!",1
I purchased this in the red (really more of a brick color) and wore it so much that i went back to get it in black too! i received a ton of compliments when i wore it! the fabric is a nice weight and it hangs beaufully. looks great over skinny jeans or leggings. i plan on wearing it year round!!,5
"I love this tank. i got it in the turquoise and just ordered the blue. this tank is indeed linen and does not wrinkle. it's fitted without being too tight. i have a somewhat shorter torso and narrow waist and athletic build and this looks great! i'm not a fan of flowy tops in general so thrilled to find this easy, casual piece. i ordered an xs but am usually either xs or s in retailer.",5
So glad i purchased this top! it has great style and can be matched with just about everything. the material is very soft and it seems really durable.,5
This is a nice shirt and very flattering. the ivory is actually more of a tan/brown- i would not call it ivory or off white. the material has a nice texture to it as well. it does run big and long so keep that in mind when purchasing.,5
"I love these cozy, fashionable leggings. they are super flattering and thick enough to wear to yoga or out and about in the real world. i will definitely be getting another pair! they seem true to size. i am tall (5'11) and usually wear a lg.",5
Loved the look of this sweater online. was disappointed when i took it out of the package i was surprised at how stiff and itchy it was. i ordered my usual medium and though at first they shipped the wrong size it was small all over.  it felt cheep definelty not worth the high price. knew it was definitely going back,1
"I love these jeans. they're incredibly soft, super comfortable and hold their shape. i can wear them for hours on end and i don't get that droopy, snagging look jeans can get when they stretch out. 
 

fit: i am normally a 29/30 depending on the jean. i took these in the 30 - i usually have a difficult time finding skinny jeans that fit my legs and don't fall off my waist. these have enough give to accommodate my larger legs, but the material holds well, so i don't need a belt to keep them up",5
I bought this tunic for my mom as a birthday gift. it is very good quality and will look cute for fall too.,5
"For cat lovers in particular, these socks will grab your attention. they are fine quality ankle socks. the kittens are really more moss green than beige.",5
"Retailer has done it again! i love this top. i purchased it for our engagement photos. i am typically a small or medium, and decided to size down for this one. i purchased a small and it fit perfectly! its not near as long as it is in the photo, which pleased me. i did read about busty ladies having a problem with the fit - and i can definitely see how that would be an issue.",5
"This top was surprisingly very flattering. it hugged my curves in just the right way and the slits on the side are a nice touch. i'm 5'2"" and about a 34c and the xs was tight (in a good way) around my chest and then more flowy after. soft material and the red color is beautiful!",5
"I ordered the red and am watching for my size in the green to come back into stock. i was already expecting my bra straps to be exposed, not a big deal as with shoulder length hair it covers them so i found this top to be exactly as pictured/described. it fits like it looks on the model and i thought the color to be spot on. i have washed it once in the washer on cold and dried only for a few minutes on low as i like to do with delicate knits to regain shape and i think it looks as good as it di",5
"Fell in love with this sweater the minute i saw it. the crocheted front is stunning. the small fit perfectly, 5'5"", 36c. i am usually between a small and medium so if a small is usually roomy you may want to size down. it's a medium weight, soft and comfortable, not at all itchy. perfect for dressing up or down. look forward to many years of use from this fun, classic style cardigan.",5
"This sweater is beautiful! not only is the lace front gorgeous, but it is incredibly comfortable and so well crafted. definitely my favorite cardigan now.",5
"This is a really elegant sweater coat--the faux fur trim adds a lot of flair and the ""mismatching"" color blocks on each side keeps things playful. the material is soft and cozy, but my one concern is that the threads can get snagged. otherwise, though, it's a winner!",5
"Love this top. makes me look slimmer, comfortable as well",5
"This top is perfect for wanting that fall/winter look in warmer climates. the slits on the sides allow for a lot of movement and turtleneck is just right. i love wearing it with my paige bell canyon flairs and some clogs! my only thing i wish was that it was cut in so much at the top, as how you can see at the model's armpit, wish that part was a little wider it would be a bit more flattering. otherwise great top, i have it in black and been thinking about getting it in the orange color too!",5
"I work with children and have a casual dress environment, this top gives me much needed style to my work wardrobe.",5
"I adore this sweater!  is it a bit itchy? yes.  do i care?  certainly not enough to send it back. great length, hangs nicely. unique without being gaudy. great purchase.",5
Finally got cold enough to wear this shirt. i love it...got lots and lots of compliments. great quality,5
3 tags - one quite huge (about 2'' by 3'') - very itchy. so i cut out the tags and they are sewn with some kind of hard poky plasticy thread - now even more itchy! i will have to wear these inside out.,1
"Soft knit, perfectly finished, comfortable and looks great on the model and the previous reviewers' mom.  it just looks too 'empty-nester' for my style (and i won't be until 2035!)  this is a nice base for a creative dresser/accessorizer, which i'm not.  i'm also messy so it's hard to keep ivory clothing coffee free.  i'm glad i tried it on because it proves how great a label knitted & knotted is for quality garments.  just had to pass on this for personal style reasons.",5
"I have too many grey cardigans. i also have a lot of oversized cardis. but i had to have this one because the stitch pattern is so nice and the yarns are so soft and snuggly. how could i resist? the weave is a bit open work but it still keeps me warm & happy. it also lays in a way that doesn't make me look bulky and top heavy, which my body type already is. i feel sorry for the first reviewer who kept getting subpar sweaters. mine arrived brand new in factory cellophane. i would advise that this",5
"Adorable & unique swtr & wld go w/ many things. note that 1 front pocket is slightly higher than the other. looks that way in the pic too. it's the ""retailer unique touch"". i don't mind abt that. it's too itchy for me. i ordered the sp to have shorter arms-fell just above my knuckles which is fine. i have many t-necks to wear under it but i decided i really didn't need another itchy swtr, so returned. no worry, retailer has plenty of other items of interest!",5
"Surprised abt the prev review. i had picked mine up at the store a few months back. purchased my usual size s. it's a little oversized & soft. the front pockets really do appeal to me as always w/ a cardi. i wear the light grey cowled t-neck top w/ it called the ""carra turtleneck"" w/ paige black skinnys. i have the other colors in the t-neck as well which go well w/ it also. worn a few times when cool but lately it's been warm again. it's abt to be cool again & look forward to wearing. very comf",5
"I tried this on in the store and i couldn't keep it on my body for more then 30 seconds. it's extremely itchy, which is a pity, because i do appreciate the design. :(",1
"The stitched v-neck tunic is a very charming piece to your wardrobe. it is soft and feminine, and has added charm with the fringed bottom.
it is a comfortable piece that looks great with leggings or skinny/straight jeans. 
it is a loose fitting design, so it is a bit large. opt for a smaller size if you prefer a closer fit to your curves.",5
Highly recommend this top. received lots of compliments on the day that i wore. recommend wearing with a tank top.,5
"I sized up to a medium from a small and was glad i did. the top drapes nicely and the fabric is soft. 

5'7"" 140 lb 32 b, usually a small on top.",5
"I love this to throw over leggings, covers your butt. great fabric and quality. i bought white and gray, after they arrived i knew i needed a black one, but, sadly, it doesn't come in black :(
i ordered xs, and it's roomy. size down for sure.",5
"I ordered two colors and was happy with them both.  i wear tanks under many tops in the warm weather as so many are sheer.  i like a layered look, and having layers to peel as needed.  these tops are great on their own as well!  i recommend them to anyone wanting swing and extra length.  really love the fabric too!",5
As beautiful as in the picture. couldn't go wrong with it. excellent quality and gorgeous color.,5
"I saw this dress in the store tried it on and , love! it is so hard to find a white dress that is not too fancy or frilly. this dress fits great and flatters my full figure (size 12 to 14), plus it has pockets! the woven material with the big fun flowers is accented by the plain band at the bottom which falls just above the knee. the center of the flower adds a nice three dimensional touch. i brought it in a large and i will wear this lovely feminine flirty beauty all spring and summer. from fun",5
I bought this in white at my local store. great staple to wear in the heat of the summer or as a layering piece. i bought my normal size medium and it fits loose and flowy. i wore a nude racer back bra and felt comfortable without a cami. great basic addition to my closet.,5
"Missed these last year in black, so snatched them up when i saw them this season! great,versatile wardrobe piece - dress them up or down with knee-hi boots, booties, or great heeled pump with silk blouse or sweater. love something that i can wear so many ways, and look and feel polished and put together.",5
These are as comfortable as any other leggings. they are thick enough that they are not see through (such a pet peeve when i see people with see through leggings). the front panel is so soft and i feel like it gives more of a professional vibe. they are a bit cropped/short but i'm tall so i'm used to this.,5
"I bought the white in a m, one size down from my normal. i could have gone with a s, given the swingy shape and forgiving nature of the linen. it is very light and comfortable. the length is a tunic on me, at 5'6"", so keep that in mind. if you dry it in the dryer it will shrink for sure. i never recommend drying linen knits in the dryer because they will likely develop holes. i love this tank and will probably buy another color or two. if they get black or grey i will def. buy another one.",5
"I'm so excited that retailer is bringing back some of the gorgeous fabrics and details they used to have. the all over embroidary is beautiful, the cotton/silk blend is delicious, and there's enough shaping that the top doesn't look too boxy. i did end up sizing down for a slightly more fitted loo and for a smaller armhole. i also picked through a couple of tops to find the one i wanted, since the embroidery pattern wasn't centered on some of them.",5
"I love these pants. they are very flattering and comfy, and look like real leather. they are also machine washable which is great. i've worn mine 5 times already.",5
"This is one of my favorite tanks i have ever worn. the swing style means you can wear it with any pants, and the straps are wide enough to accommodate a serious bra. i usually wear an l/xl but am wearing a m in these, so definitely size down at least once. you will love this!",5
"Simple style with a great fit. love the pink, mustard, and cream colors together. fits true to size.",5
I'm fairly petite and was not expecting this to be as long as it was on me- it's actually great for leggings or skinny jeans though- good quality material too!,5
Love this tank! so easy to throw on quickly and still look out together!,5
"This tank fit perfectly and goes with everything, will be purchasing in more colors!",5
"This dress is so much more stunning in person than in the photos. it's incredibly flattering, and i like how it pans out at the bottom. it also has pockets! although it has a built-in slip, it is a little see-through, so keep that in mind, otherwise, i can't wear it enough.",5
"I have been looking for leather or faux leather pants for a while, and these look great. they are more expensive than other faux leather pants, but the quality is much higher. i'm glad i didn't buy the cheap ""leather look"" pants i keep seeing. the only caveat is that they do run small, like the other reviewers said. i am a 27 pretty consistently in this brand, but i got the 28. they fit perfectly. because of the material on the back, they do not lose their shape, either. highly recommended.",5
"This top is so beautiful!  really well made with solid embroidery - not the thin lightweight type.  i thought it ran rather large but i don't have the bust to fill in the top area.  i'm usually a small in tops (sometimes medium due to my height 5'8"") but went down to an xs so the arm holes didn't show too much.  length was still great.  a steal at the sale price!",5
"This is a beautiful long midi blazer that happens to feel like a sweatshirt. buy it! you'll look super classy and put together. i wear to work and going out. i've been noted to also curl up in bed wearing this because it's so comfortable and i forgot to switch into a sweatshirt. 

note i'm on the short side so the ""blazer"" ends up being a little longer for me. i happen to like it because it gives it a little more formalness of a longer coat while still being spring weight (jersey/terry on the",5
"I love tracy reese. this skirt did not disappoint. i saw it originally in store & fell in love. i waited to see if it would go on sale... and it did!

i put on the size 12 & it fit gorgeously. the fabric is a bit stiff and bulky- but i think that's so it holds its shape. first thing i went into my living room & began twirling around.

i am 5'5"" 150lbs. athletic build. the sizing is true to tracy reese. i'll need to get the skirt hemmed as it's quite long on me. but- this little gem will be worn",5
"I was at my local retailer this weekend, needing a bathing suit for an upcoming trip and this set was sitting in the ""get it while it lasts"" section, in my size. i tried it on (top in two different sizes 32c and 34b and a bottom), and it was literally the only time in my life i've ever tried on a bathing suit and been happy with the results! great material, the design is retro but with a modern twist with the fabric, supportive top without squishing (went with the 32c...same as my regular bras), t",5
"I was hesitant to buy these jeans online because citizens are generally not very forgiving, being that they don't have much stretch.  they are always in the stack that i try on but haven't bought a pair of citizens in several years. these are totally different!  the have enough stretch to be sculpting without being uncomfortable while keeping the substantial feeling that comes with denim versus leggings.  i looooooove these jeans!!!",5
These pants look great on and i love the ponte fabric on the back of the pants.  i usually wear a 28 in pilcro but i went with a 29 for these.  great length and my only criticism would be the price.  a little expensive for vegan leather.,5
"I somehow overlooked this online and saw it in the store. i am a 10/12 or m/l. i tried on the medium and it was tight in the bust but fit great in the waist. i ended up ordering the large online. the large felt good but a tad big in the waist. it hit my true waist though and looked good. i then noticed the straps were agustable. i wonder if i tried the medium and loosened the straps if it would have worked. either way i love the dress, so pretty and flowy. i wasn't bothered by the fabric and did",5
Love these pants. they look great with a pair of mid calf boots and a loose t-shirt. i usually wear a size 26 or 27 but went with a 27 on these. they are very flattering and edgy. love them!,5
"These leggings are great because they are comfortable, stylish and can be dressed down or up. great pair of fun leggings to wear. i'm 5""3' and 180 and so i'm not a skinny girl, but they are flattering on me. i love them!",5
"Comfort is very important to me. as someone who is not a skinny girl, slimming clothing is important to me. this top is very pretty, comfortable, and can be dressed up or down. it does require dry cleaning, which might be a con for some people.",5
"I tried these on in the store in the small and needed to xs, so i ordered them online. they are perfect! i wore them last night and got so many compliments. for reference, i am 5'2"" and 125 lbs.",5
"This dress is lovely- exactly as pictured on the site. love the colors/pattern and received so many compliments when i wore it to a brunch party. could easily be dressed up for an outdoor wedding. it definitely runs big- i am usually an 8/10 and originally ordered in a large. was way too big, so had to exchange for a m and there was still some room. make sure you size down!",5
"This velvet maxi dress is what fall dreams are made of. it fits very true to size and is the perfect length, about to ankles. the material is soft and had so much subtle details in it... gorgeous! once the weather cools a bit it will also pair nicely with tall boots, and an undershirt. i plan on rocking this all fall and winter!",5
"This is a super cute, adorable and flattering maxi. it's very comfortable and soft. i stayed tts in this dress... the length hit just right .. ...perfect for summer",5
"They are exactly as picture. i have a lot of extra skin on my midsection, due to pregnancies. they are a little high waist so they grab all the midsection perfectly. the fabric is good quality, the tones are just beautiful... it is a little bit see through on your bum. i always try to hide my bum so no issue for me.",5
"As part of the over 60 crowd, i rarely wear dresses any more - but this called out to me.. and it didn't disappoint! i ordered the plum - true to size and and color. i usually wear a medium and it fit perfectly. i liked the previous review suggestion and i will also wear this with boots and t-shirt to get more use out of it as well as dressing up.it's a real keeper.",5
"I debating this dress for a long time. i just was hesitant because it is very form fitting. i think this dress runs true to size. after reading other reviews, i was debating ordering a 6 (i'm normally an 8). and i am glad i went with the 8. it is form fitting. the material is just absolutely beautiful and not stiff. it is a bit thicker, which will be nice in the fall. colors are true to the pictures shown and length falls as shown on model.",5
"So versatile and comfortable. i plan adding this into my rotation year round under a jacket or cardigan during the colder months. if you prefer baggier fit, i would suggest going up a size.",5
"This really is a gorgeous jacket! i would give it 4.5 stars just because sometimes it can be a bit unflattering in the tummy area (poofs out a bit) at certain times, but i had to remind myself that is the style of the coat. i am petite and curvy on bottom, so this could just be me. tried wearing with a skinny belt and it looked cute, i think i will try both ways. seems very warm. beautful colors and the material is soft and not itchy at all! excited because versatile for everyday wear but also l",5
"I got the moss and love the color. the style and size in 31p is perfect for my short self. very comfy for work. now, i need more colors...",5
"I ordered this dress with great expectations after coveting one in a store, but unfortunately it did not work for me. the fabric is a stretch cotton jacquard which is absolutely beautiful, and the colors are gorgeous. i do not think it runs big, i sized up and it still fit me like a sausage casing. if you are tall and thin with no bulges, this dress is for you.",5
"I love the pure and good short sleeve tees. they feel beautiful, and wash beautifully! i just hang them to dry and they are perfect for the next time, i buy a size medium as i like them to flow nicely at the hips!",5
"I ordered this dress in the orange and it is a perfect addition for my closet. its comfortable yet classy. i did order a size up and went with the medium because i am a dd. so glad i did because the top part of me stays secured. if i went with the small, i am afraid i would be falling out. it is long but i will take to a tailor and have them make some adjustments. its a versatile dress and can be worn at events or just for hanging out in.",5
"This dress first caught my eye because of the beautiful color combination. and when i tried it on, i was sold. it's super soft and comfy and just the right amount of coverage.",5
"I just bought this adorable top in the black motif and was surprised by how good it looked! it runs tts (34d-27-35) and got it in my usual size small. it's very soft, the print is so cute, the arm openings aren't too big and the length is just like on the model, not too long or short. i think it's even cuter in person and i like the price point. a very sweet top so worth a try!",5
"I really like this. it's not too baggy and not tight. it drapes nicely. and the pattern is a bit dainty without being frilly.
i love this blouse.",5
"I really like the red version of this shirt. it will add a pop of color under a blazer for work or it can be easily accessorized with a necklace, for the weekend. i am 137 lbs, a 34d chest and the small fit me perfectly.",5
"I want this in every color! fits tts...so comfortable, flattering, and fabric feels like it will hold up well (fingers crossed). love love love.",5
Usually wear stevie jeans from ag but wanted to try something different. now i love farrah!,5
"This dress is gorgeous! i sized up from my usual 6 to an 8, cause i'm not much for form fitted dresses. however, it was still pretty body con for me. i passed in it for now, but in the future i might try a 10 petite?? the color is a nice brick red with a textured whitish pattern. and it is soft ... like i wanted to snuggle up on the couch in it, but i had to refrain! i've been having bad luck with zippers from retailer dresses recently, but this one was smooth sailing and pretty too! the length wa",5
"This top is beautiful in both colors, it was a difficult decision at the store. i went with the black, and my usual size s fit well with a little room, but in no way overly baggy. i tried on the xs which also fit but was a little constricting. the quality is excellent and i highly recommend this top. 1 question i have however, is that the online description says machine wash, however my tag states dry clean only. just curious if anyone has hand washed this yet? otherwise, it is a beautiful, comf",5
"I ordered the xxs p as this dress is not a fitted dress, and that was the right size for me. only thing is the length is a bit linger still 9lower on calf for me), the straps are almost tight, so i would say the dress is a reversed taper shape. color is beautiful, i ordered green as the other color (plum) doesn't have petite available. green is rich, and classy, the fabric is surprisingly soft. i love the little details in the velvet. definitely need a strapless bra for this one.

115 lbsm 30d",5
"If i had to describe on two words, that would be it. the material is not a stiff no-give material, nbut rahter a soft stretchy material, with some depth (the design has ""grooves"", not sure how to explain it#. if you are short, i would definitely go with petite though, it was a little too long on regular size and hit in the ""wrong"" spot on my calves. very flattering, and nice cut. i dind't order yet as it is new and i jsut bought a few dresses... but in my basket forh te next ""sale"" :) #if they s",5
The pictures don't do this dress justice. it is fantastic! the fit is perfect and it is super comfortable while still looking polished. a must have dress!,5
I love this top so much! the fit is super flattering and forgiving in the tummy area-win.,5
"This dress is simply gorgeous. the slit is just right, the colors are great, and most of all the fabric is very comfy! i highly recommend!",5
I love all the pilcro chinos. they fit great and the material is so soft. they also wash very well.,5
"This dress is stunning - the cut, the color (mine is a dark green, not purple as pictured) and the material are all super unique and gorgeous. i first tried on a medium but it was a little too large - the small fit perfectly and still has the loose romantic look intended. i can't wait to wear this piece with a suede moto jacket, or even denim for a casual funky look. love!",5
"Love this top so much that i bought it in both colors. the fabric is wonderful and the pleated front is a nice feature. i also like the fabric covered buttons. you can button this top all the way or leave the top few buttons undone. either way, it looks cute. i especially like that it looks great under a blazer or cardigan and will look good uncovered when the weather heats up. great quality and features for the price.",5
"Love this dress. i bought is for a tropic vacation my husband and i went on and it was great. i got so many compliments while wearing it, and it was comfortable! dress is a little roomy in the top, but not enough to prevent me from wearing it. i ordered a medium.",5
"I was nervous about this dress, as when i ordered it there were no reviews yet...and shortly after they, they started coming in and were only negative. yes it runs pretty big (i'm usually a large/12 but could tell from the model it would run big) but it's supposed to be loose. i wouldn't say it's the most flattering - but you can tell it's shapeless from the picture! it's a great casual dress, perfect for hot days when i don't want my clothing touching my skin.",5
"This dress is stretchy and soft, a great length, and an out of this world pattern. it will probably be flattering on every body, but it certain flattered mine.",5
"I bought this to wear for my baby shower at 34 weeks. i was able to buy it in my size and still get a great fit, and the skirt hits right at my bump with the band just above it. great option for expecting mothers that can be worn after baby, the top is also snug enough to feel like it covers properly (could be too snug if you are large chested though).",5
"These t-shirts by pure + good are buttery soft and so flattering. they are just loose enough to drape beautifully and the detailing at the neckline takes them just a step above basic tee. i have 2 from last year, machine washed many many times (on delicate cycle) and they still look almost new. i was hoping to pick up a couple more but they're gone! please retailer, bring these tees back!! i would kill for that beautiful dark blue...",5
"I ordered the black and white shirt thinking it was polka dots, but turned out to be stars instead which was even cuter. fits true to size and is very soft and comfortable. my first thought after trying it on was that i should have ordered another one!",5
I was disappointed with the style and quality of this dress. it poofs out funny in the waste and it just looks very unflattering. i'm sending it back.,1
"Just as breathtaking in person . . . and in a totally comfortable, soft, stretch fabric. i'm 5' 8"" 120 lbs. 34b; purchased the size 0 and 2 for comparison; decided on size 2 as the size 0 was really tight in the chest area--meant only for the tiniest! the dress is long on me and i'll likely get it hemmed up a bit so it hits just above the knees--but i'm grateful it's too long (something i can fix) rather than being too short.",5
"I've always had great difficulty finding a pair of shorts that i like the fit of - most are either too short, too thin, too low, or too tight. i have athletic legs that ""mainstream"" fit doesn't work well with, for the most part.

fortunately, that was not the case with the neda shorts. i was first drawn to them because of the striking but subtle pattern - and they also fit well, with a good length and a structured fit. they have a medium-high waistband and a slight stretchiness, and the fabric",5
"This dress is so gorgeous! it fits perfectly, is stretchy, wonderful, comfortable, and the fabric is nice and thick with beautiful texture. i absolutely love it! i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs, with a pretty athletic build, and it fits like a dream! i love the color, the fabric, the fit, the stretch, the comfort, the sexyness of it..... it's my new favorite! highly recommended!",5
"I bought this dress to wear as a casual summer staple. i like classic things with a twist, and this fits the bill. it is nice quality, and the colors are vivid. it is slightly tight in the bust line for me, but it is not retailer's fault that i am a bit too busty for this dress. i'll deal with it. otherwise, the dress is nice quality, and will come in handy throughout summer. the price is right, so grab it!!",5
"These pants look nice and they are comfortable too! the relaxed fit isn't sloppy, and the colors are great.",5
This dress fits true to size and is great to wear around on a warm day. you can dress it up or down so there are many uses for it. this brand has always provided great quality too. i'm excited for warmer weather!,5
"This dress is the perfect combo of flattering, comfort, and quality. i purchased the turquoise color, which is vibrant! this will be my go to dress for spring. the material is super soft, flowy and medium weight. i ordered petite s, probably could have got xs. i love, love, love this dress!",5
Beautiful dress! vibrant colors. fabric has a nice weight and drapes perfectly. 36 dd up top and the girls have plenty of space.,5
"I ordered this dress in a petite but it arrived in a regular, the rest fit and in the meantime the petites ran out in my size.  the dress is too long but it is so beautiful i will get it shortened.  the fabric is lovely.  i am blonde and the green is so nice with my hair... which is a good thing since the other colour was totally sold out.  try not to miss out on this lovely purchase.....",5
"I purchased this in the ping/orange color. i am 5""8 and 155lbs, the medium fit perfectly. very soft texture with a nice flow. will be purchasing in other colors.",5
"Love it ! ...although i had to purchase it in 3 sizes before finding the right one. it does run large. i normally take a l or el ... but a medium in this had the perfect drape ! i am 5'11"" and 185 lbs and it is very flattering ! a perfect piece to be worn as a dress or as a tunic over skinny pants ... can be as sophisticated or casual as you choose to make it with accessories !",5
"They have all the features i've been searching for:
the leg is straight, not tapered or fitted. the fabric is soft, with an authentic worn-in look. the overall look is casual, relaxed and cool. i love these chinos and definitely plan to buy more.",5
"I'm 4 11"" 120 and my usual small fit. as with everything....way too long. story of my life and i keel a tailor on call.",5
"I bought the one with blue and white top and black bottom. absolutely loved it! i am 5""2 so the dress is part is a bit long for me---ended up wearing my 4.5 inch heels to make it fit. the fabric is more heavy than what it seems in the pictures. but that makes it more formal. it's great!",5
"This dress was returned to our store and i was intrigued the second i saw it. the dress is definitely oversized. so much so that you could probably size down a size or two. but what i love about this dress is the style. its meant to be oversized...and with the print, the asymmetric cut and the oversized look...its very unique! the color is exactly as it appears and the material is wonderful. thin but soft and comfortable...really easy to wear! you could do this as a dress, or with leggings and b",5
I love how pretty and soft this shirt is. it falls well. i want to wear it everyday.,5
I love this dress! it was a tad long ( i'm a shorty) but i loved the cut and versatility of the material/ design that i took it to the tailor. now it is perfect! i wore it to an engagement party but i could see it going very casual or very high end depending on styling. love.,5
"I love this dress! picked one up in store at 20% off--even better. i'm 6', 160lbs and 40-29-41, and i did find the waist runs a bit wide. because i'm tall, i think the length was a plus, but a shorter person would definitely want to go with a petite. i usually wear an 8-10 but bought a 6 in this dress, so i think it runs a tad large. the fabric is weighty enough to hide minor lumps and bumps, but i'll be wearing shapewear anyway. the pattern is perfectly aligned (just like the online images) and",5
"These ultra-slimming jeans are so comfy. the rise is a little higher than i am used to but it covers those little muffin tops perfectly. the color is very dark - almost black which adds to the slimming effect. i have really long legs and these have a little extra at the bottom, which is great. you could wear with flats, booties, boots - just about any type of shoes. these are my new favorite jeans.",5
"I loved this dress so much i bought in the cream/pink as well as the blue/teal. it is so light and easy to throw on. the slits are higher on me (i am 5'2) but not in a risquã© way. it's very flattering and gives it a little sassiness.

i wish they had even more colors to choose from. that is how obsessed i am with it!",5
"This dress is versatile and cute! i purchased the xxs at 5'4"" 115lbs and it fit perfect. a steal at the sale price!",5
"This is instantly one of my favorite dresses but please note it runs large, size down! i am 5'10"" and regularly a size 8-10. i tried both of those sizes on in store and picked the 8. it was perfectly form fitted and the perfect length. when i got home i realized i had been reading the uk sizes on the tag and really bought a size 4. no idea how it fit me, i have never purchased a size 4 in my life! i am adding a photo so potential customers can see what it looks like on an average sized person :)",5
"It drapes perfect and washes well. i own all the colors, they do not disappoint. i'm a medium.",5
"My favorite pants, casual and a bit dressier by changing my top. comfortable, classic, well made",5
"I bought these pants in red after trying them on in store. they are soft and company. they have a loose fit, which is typical for chinos, so they pair best with a fitted top. i'm 5'2"""" and these were the perfect length when rolled. they run a bit big and stretch out though and eventually were too baggy. i loved them though so i ordered them in a size down. i'd definitely buy them in other colors too if they become available in my size!",5
"It's lightweight, soft, & slinky, unike the average t-shirt. the slinkiness makes it skim the body nicely.",5
"The photos on the website do not do the dress justice. i am into texture, pattern and contrasting fabrics, this dress is gorgeous in person; not only has pattern, but the pattern is woven, so there is this wonderful texture as well that i had to try. some of the reviews said the dress runs large, others that this is a bodycon dress. i ordered a size 8 and my usual 10. both were figure hugging but the size 10 allowed this to be office wear while still being flattering. i am fairly straight, small",5
"This dress is so pretty and i instantly fell in love with it when i tried it on. i generally wear size 0 or 2 and opted for the 2 for more room. i know some reviewers felt that the dress ran too long at the bottom, but for me, i was sold on it because this dress is form fitting, i like a more conservative look for work. wouldn't want form-fitting and short dress. my favorite kind of dress is form-fitting and falls at or below my knees a little.",5
"Perfect fit. this dress is super flattering, the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on. the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage. the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty! the perfect spring to summer dress!",5
I'm so glad i trusted my instincts and decided not to size down on this luxurious dress since my body type is so different from the previous reviewers.  size small would have surely cut off my circulation around my shoulders.  i bought mp since i have thick arms/shoulders/back and i'm short 135# 38-27-35.   my only gripe is how skinny and insubstantial the straps are so maybe i'll get those changed.  i'm tempted to buy the other color since this dress is so beautiful but i really don't nred it!,5
"This dress is extremely body conscious. so if you want to make an impression, wear this dress. the fabric is thick and best worn on a cooler night. the pattern is gorgeously done, pieced together like a garment three times the cost. the cut of the armholes might not be flattering on those with broad shoulders or chubby upper arms (like myself). for me this dress is tts but way too long, so i will have to hem.",5
I purchased this in the black in an xl. i am typically a 14-16 dress size and i would say this runs tts with a flowing fit on the bottom. the top is fitted but has some stretch to it. absolutely gorgeous fit and quality. i love this so much i want to purchase the teal color. a spring must have!!!,5
I have 3 pairs of these chinos i love them so much. they come soft like a well-worn favorite but are high quality at a great price. i'm typically a size 4. i bought the 26 size but think i could have gone down to a 25. otherwise very happy with this purchase!,5
"Very happy i purchased this jacket - although to me it is really a coat. it fits wonderfully and is so soft. i appreciate the uniqueness - not the usual dull winter shades of black/gray/navy. although i live in minneapolis much of the winter & it will not be warm enough once the temps drop beyond 20 degrees, it is perfect for the in-between 21- 50 degree days. i am a size 6 (5'5"", 135 lbs). tried the small & medium. the s was a bit snug in the hips so chose the m and it is just right.",5
"I adore this dress. i wanted/needed to add a few velvet pieces to my wardrobe and when i saw this online i decided this had to be one of them. i'm 5'9 and ~128 pounds and ordered the x-small and it fits me perfectly. the color is so rich and the details are delicate, understated, and yet striking. i intend to wear this for a variety of occasions.",5
"I got this new dress for a work meeting and instantly received compliments. it has a very unique pattern that is perfect for the office or date night. it is a little long and falls below the knee, but otherwise the dress fits and feels great. the fabric has a nice weight, so it covers any imperfections you might want to hide.",5
There's just the right amount of billowy grace in this dress. the fit is perfect and the material moves and breathes with you. cute with a jean jacket on chillier days too.,5
"Wow, wow, wow! this is so retailer! the dress is more breathtaking in person, it is a beautiful work of art from top to bottom. the fabric is super soft and flows perfectly. the lining is super soft as well, and it doesn't fall all the way down to the hem so that the burnout detail would show through on the bottom. i don't like spaghetti straps but the straps are very sturdy and high quality, very comfortable. fyi, the color is much richer (a shade darker) in person, like an eggplant color. i orde",5
"Looove this so much. the color in person is a rich wine. the pintuck and button details are hard to see in the photo, but there are three buttons so you can chose to open a couple.",5
"I bought this unique beauty in a size 0. the fit was superb and without compromise. the ascetics are incomparable, as well as the quality. the most stunning dress i have purchased from retailer in quite a while!",5
"This could seriously fit a large and it's an xs. so frustrating!! this is the fourth retailer dress that is ordered that is just enormous. i get the whole ""loose fit"" style, but seriously??? you've taken it to a whole new level, retailer!!! another trip to the store to return another item. a complete waste of my time. ugh.",1
Picked this up at the local retailer in both colors. the red version was styled in the store with the adorable blue snail cardigan - which i also bought. highly recommend.,5
"Tts. i'm 38c, 8-10 and m fits just right. nice and fitted at the top, flowy skirt. i got the cream and love the skirt pattern.",5
"Just bought this top in the black at my local retailer and i love it. it fits well, not too large and ""tenty"". it actually fit me under the arms, too. usually, retailer tops tend to run huge, not this one. i love that it is easy to layer with a long boyfriend cardi or a more structured jacket. i'm 5'3"" 110 pounds and took the xs. i would definitely recommend this top!",5
"This sweater fits perfect and the pink trim makes it stunning! i was pleasantly surprised when i tried this on. i don't usually pay this much for a cardigan, but the quality and feel are better than usual.",5
These pants are the perfect weight and comfort. they are cozy enough to wear around the house and sleep in as well. i highly recommend these dreamy pants.,5
The picture is not a good depiction of what the skirt actually looks like. the colors are more varied and green is the dominant color. it looks great on and the colors compliment each other. i would definitely recommend it as a daily go to item for your wardrobe.,5
"Very unique, cute top. i had to order up a size as i thought it ran a little on the small size.",5
"I really loved the way this shirt looked on me. it's forgiving and flattering, and really lightweight. the fabric, however, couldn't even withstand half a day's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center. i have no idea how this happened, as i wasn't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it. 

such a shame. this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me.",1
"Good quality, fit and length! love them:)",5
"I have these pants in the brown & red colors, and i love them both equally! they are stretchy, and stretch out a very little bit as you wear them, but retain their shape & neatness.",5
This fit great. i am 5'8 and 130 lbs. i ordered a size medium and it fit perfect. i wore a black tank/cami underneath for warmth in the office.,5
This dress is great for hiding any insecurities. it's also very comfy.,5
I received this top in the mail today not what i expected at all! it is a great fabric just way too much of it. it is proportionally incorrect width wise. unfortunately this one will be going back.,1
I love tiny button down tops. this one didn't work at all for me. i was excited about the mix prints but on it looked like i was wearing a vest over a striped shirt. also the arm was frayed on the shirt i tried on.,1
"I have been thinking about getting this dress for a while, but was holding out because i was concerned it would look like a sack! but i am so glad i got it, and so glad my usual size was not available! typically i'm a m or a m petite but i ordered this in a s petite. while still flowy, i think it would have been overwhelming in my usual size. i think it will be great for many occasions as the solid black can be dressed up or down. i can't wait to wear it! definitely consider sizing down.",5
This shirt is as cute on as it looks in the pictures. i love the fit and felt great in it on a mom's night out with jeans and heals. i also think it could be dressed up for work or further down for a day out and about! love it!,5
This is my new favorite dress!,5
"Color was a perfect match for the linen slacks i wanted to pair it with, however the top was way, say too big so i'll be sending it back.",5
"Great skirt, can be dressy, work or casual, love it!",5
"I purchased this lovely blouse to go with slim cropped stretchy pants. good for bum coverage while still looking sleek and tailored. i purchased the medium instead of small as this is a true fitted button up style and i wanted to avoid the gaping at bust. the arm holes are fitted nicely as well, no bra exposure. looks very nice on. on point for sure?.
 (for reference i'm 5'5"",34dd, ruler shaped figure,narrow shoulders and usually a small or medium at retailer.)",5
I love this shirt! i received many compliments on it when i wore it to work with a skirt.,5
"This top is way cuter in real life. it looks a little frumpy on the model but t is very flattering on. the sleeves are split so not a warm top, but this will be a nice transitional piece. i am always looking for interesting but classy tops to war to work and this fits the bill.",5
"The sherpa vest i received from retailer was the color the model is wearing.. the same hue and shade of both the faux shearliing and faux leather. i'm very satisfied with the vest. i believe it runs a bit large. i usually wear a large, sometimes an extra large yet the m/l fit me fine. shearling is very in this year and this will complete your look-wearing either pants or skirts.",5
"I love the style, easy to wear to work or out for an evening. great quality.",5
The color is completely off! i loved the way this vest looks in the picture! i was excited to have that vest but unfortunately what i received in the mail was a huge disappointment. it came wrinkled and the brown is not as rich as it is in the picture. very pale. horrible.,1
"Retailer does it again! i'm constantly looking for pieces that will work for a day at the office and then a night out, and this skirt is perfect! you can't really tell in the pictures, but there is a larger slit that separates the grey material from the black, which makes the skirt have more of a statement. it runs true to size and the material is thick enough that it will do great in winter!",5
"This skirt is great and you can't beat it for the price. it fits more like a pencil skirt on me, and looks sort of a-line on the model. very nice work appropriate skirt. though the slit comes higher than i expected. my thighs are tattooed so i put on some black tights and it looks great with a blouse and cardigan!",5
It fits great. it is super comfortable. have gotten many compliments on how this skirt looks on me!,5
"This top is prettier in person than on the picture. the picture kind of makes the material look really cheap - it actually looks nice in person. it's very comfy and feminine, showing just the right amount of skin on the arms. the elastic on the waist also makes me look 3 lbs. lighter. it goes good with jeans or skirts.",5
"This blouse is just so beautiful! but i do love white blouses, so that may influence my enthusiasm. however, once i buttoned it up, it was just dreamy. i have a long torso and am tall for a typical xs, so it's often hard to find something that's the right length. this is perfect! it may overwhelm some ladies who are on the petite side of height, but it's a rare find for me. paired with a pair of cropped pants because i'd come in a dress, it looks delightfully vintage in the best of ways. i'm sti",5
Very flatttering skirt ! super cute ! highly recommend !,5
"This is a high-quality swimsuit that can be worn inside out. easy to wear colors, fantastic pattern placement. the other side is an intense blue. i would suggest going by the size chart on the mara hoffman site. 
.
 i think this should look great on athletic figures. the back is low-cut and the bottom has medium coverage, not as skimpy as brazilian cut bottoms. not ideal for hour-glass figures as there is no bust support, and you will show quite a bit from the side (it is cut in at the front w",5
Wearing this today! it fits true is size & is machine washable. the slits make it unique. don't hesitate to purchase this one.,5
"This is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion. i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house. it's a really warm dress too, so great for colder weather. probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps.

it's so comfortable and it's made with high quality material. i'm curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist- it's a pretty straight cut.",5
I loved the way this sweater was made.  my arms are really short so the sleeves were way too long and looked silly rolled.,5
I had been looking for this dress in xs. the small ran large on me and xs had sold out online. i'd been searching for it calling every store around and not having any luck.. when allison called me from store 428 highland village in houston.. she had found the dress for me in the woodlands.. i was able to purchase it and i can't wait to get it.. it will be perfect for the hot summer here in texas. thank you allison for such great customer service and retailer for employing such great staff.,5
"I tried this on in store in blue, and it's so comfortable. it's just the right level of loose to be flattering. for me, the cap sleeves were a little strange. they just didn't sit in a way that was flattering or seemed purposeful--not sure if that was the design or my body.",5
"I just bought this dress today, and it is absolutely stunning. it looks so much better in person than on the model. i think it runs true to size, however it does have relaxed fit. overall, the dress has nice quality fabric and nice flow, without adding bulk. great buy!",5
"I adore this dress! as a mom of two under 2, i need things that are cute, but no-fuss. this is exactly that piece! beautifully lined, breezy linen fabric, machine-washable, and flattering. the catch is finding the right size to flatter. i'm 5'7 and 128...found my normal size small to be really big everywhere. i went with the xs to avoid issues in the shoulders, but i maybe could have gone even smaller. fabric doesn't have a lot of give, so if you are large in the chest, my guess would be a possi",5
"This cardigan is so much more beautiful in person. i thought it would be very lightweight, but it has a nice weight to it. this will go with absolutely everything and looks lovely on!",5
I love this sweater! it does run a little large though. fits beautifully. great for cool summer nights and early fall. dress up or down.,5
I got the brown one and i'm very please with the softness of the thread and the light weight feel of the fabric.,5
"Love this tank!! the cotton is very soft which also allows some flow. i've worn this to yoga, and to teach barre and cardio dance and it's a hit! as a life-long dancer, this was a must have. my only negative is since the sizing is either xs/s or m/l, it may run too big or too small for some. i tyically wear a m or 6 in retailer tops and this is a little large in m/l; however, not to the point of being distracted with straps falling or the like. highly recommend.",5
"I am a size  14, and tall.  i was afraid that it would be too short.  the sales clerk grabbed a large,  and it fit! it's airy and lightweight and hugs nicely around the back.  the big surprise?  pockets! love it!",5
"I thought this sweater was cute online but turns out it is even cuter in person! the cotton linen blend makes it easy to layer over a tee shirt or blouse, and the neutral color goes with everything!
as a side note, included with my sweater was a signed postcard informing me that this item was not on hand at their distribution center. so they ""sounded the horns"", and their spokane, wa store ""saved the day"". thank you spokane, wa store and thank you meredith for packing with care! 
i love it!",5
Really great pair of pants/leggings. considering a second pair. great flattering fit. i ordered the petite as well because i was concerned about the length but the stride on the petite a was to short and the regular was not too long after all.,5
"I saw this online, visited my local retailer, found it! it is the most beautiful shade of blue, nicely textured material! i am 5'7"" and 148 pds, i bought the xs and it fits perfect! definately designed for us smaller busted gals!",5
"I bought this in the blue and you should definitely size down. it runs very large. it's amazingly comfortable and high quality. great length as well (not too short and not too long). it has a partial lining so it's not necessary to wear a slip which i love. i get compliments every time i wear it, even one of the saleswomen in retailer asked me where i got the dress. she was surprised when i told her it was from retailer from online. i liked it so much i just ordered the red plaid.",5
"This dress really was huge, and not at all flattering. i don't know how they got it to look good on the model in the picture. material was nice and soft, but i really don't see how anyone could look good in this, no matter what your body shape is.",1
"Cute dress. i say true to size - but keep in mind it is loose and flowy and i purchased in my usual size medium and it fits perfectly. it's lined so there is no need for a slip. very comfortable and cool. i am 5'6"" and it is 3"" above knee. i paired it with the gemline lariat turquoise necklace and have already received several compliments and my day is only 1/2 over!
a great priced dress which holds true to retailer's quality and uniqueness of items offered.",5
"Even on my 5'1"", short-waisted, 100 lb body, this was super short. it was also super boxy. not flattering at all. the blue was a good color but this is going back.",1
"Caught my eye at checkout, and had to run back to the dressing room for a quick try-on, which ended up being a great call! the dress is super easy and flattering, as the lining keeps it skimming over my hourglass shape. the fabric has a sweet floral texture, and the gathering takes a basic shape and makes it interesting. i'm 5'4"" and it came just above the knee in front, while the back was a bit longer (another flattering feature). this is going to be a summer go-to!",5
"I love these leggings! the material is a bit thicker than your typical leggings material so it hugs without being too clingy like spandex. the fit i's somewhere between leggings and skinny pants. the suede fabric feels soft and looks to be of good quality. the petite fit works perfectly for me as well, no bunching at the ankles. i can see these being a staple in the upcoming months.",5
"I recently purchased this cardigan and got so many compliments the first day i wore it.  the detail is so exquisite, it will be worth every penny.",5
"Love this sweater! it is easy to wear and goes well with multiple outfits. it is a great, flexible add to my wardrobe. it fits well, even in the sleeves!",5
"I got this in navy and love it. the overall shape is sleek and classic - body skimming but not tight - with subtle detail in the knit design that make it entirely unique. the quality and weight of the cashmere is perfect - not to heavy or light. xs fit perfect on my 5'5"" petite frame. but busty or longer-torsoed people may find the length a bit short - it hits me right at the top of regular low-rise jeans. this may be my favorite retailer buy of the season.",5
This sweater is one of a kind just like many pieces from retailer. the design is super cute the color is perfect and others dont like the sheer material however for me since it's not see through i really like it. the reason for a return is they sent me the wrong size..ordered a small (i checked my order) and i got a xs petite. so sad since large is the only size left.,5
I love love love this dress for everyday running around or you can dress it up with jewelry or a scarf. so boho and so comfortable. buying the other color now.,5
"Purchased this in the blue color in the store today. honestly, if i had just seen it online i would not have given it a second look. it really is beautiful in person. the bell sleeves are delicate as well as the pattern throughout the sweater. it fits true to size. i would wear it open with a colorful tank underneath. perhaps if you are very tall and very thin you may opt to hook it closed. the sizing is perfect, it flows and i really have to say you must see this in person to really appreciate",5
This is one of those dresses that looks so cute on the model but doesn't look anything like that in reality. it has no shape and it fits weirdly all over. i am normally a m and i ordered the s and it is massive.,1
Easy breezy summer dress!!! love the detailing under the arms!!!,5
"I love hess overalls. they are true to size and have a great vintage look to them but done in a classic way. i am 5'6"" 125lbs and a 34b. i bought the xs and it fit great! they are fitted and not sloppy like a lot of overalls. you can easily dress them up or down. soft and stretchy material is a plus",5
My bra size is a 36 c. i got the medium and the dress buttoned looked nothing like the model... the top button barely buttoned....,5
This is a a great piece.   i tried it on in denim and went out and ordered the red checked print.  this was so cute!   i loved it in the red checked and then ordered the denim.   it can be dressed up or down.  it is comfortable and there is an edgy quality to the look.  you can wear heals and a statement necklace and it really is dressed up.  order a size down and it works well.  thank you retailer!!,5
"These leggings are gorgeous. soft suede feel, perfect fit, great look, especially for dressing up and going out. love them.",5
"I never noticed this sweater online but when i saw it in the store, it was love at first sight. i agree with other reviewers that the color description is odd. the brown is a very pale gray and the blue is a light mint green. the sweater is very delicate looking and fits true to size. the sleeves are very long, covering my hands, and i have long arms. it does have enough body to make a large roll at the cuff. i do have a couple of issues that aren't related specifically to this sweater: even tho",5
"This dress is gorgeous. it looks exactly as it appears on model. the model must be wearing a petite because the regular size dress is maxi length on anyone 5'8. the petite is midi length and is perfect every where else. i am not petite, but this petite worked perfect on me for midi length.
pros of dress
the dress has nice light float fabric, with colorblind on bottom for a touch of modern.
the dress looks very dowton abby and the vintage look is hard to find now days in dress.
the dress looks fa",5
"I love this tank! its something you can dress up with a skirt, or wear over jeans. i like loose fitting tops, although i have a slender frame. this is also so comfortable. i went with a size medium, and it fits perfect.",5
I love the color of this cardigan and the cashmere is very soft. i love the detail in the stitching and how the zipper is covered. i do wish it were a bit longer but it's definitely a keeper.,5
"Just bought this top today at our local store. it's just gorgeous on. i'm a 34dd and bought the size small and it fits perfectly. if you're small chested, you can probably size down as it runs nice and full for a larger bust. it's so feminine and pretty on. a must for any wardrobe.",5
"I recently noticed that my trusty black cardigan, that i've had for years, was getting thin in the elbows and just kind of ragged, so out i went on the long journey to find the perfect cardigan with detail. this cardigan fit the bill, with a perfect fit and lovely texture, making it not just your average sweater, to go with my style. can't say anything bad about it!",5
"This dress was love at first sight.  i did have to size down from my normal size but the dress is so comfortable and cool.  as another reviewer said, it does shrink after first wash but perfect now since i am 5'2"".  it shrank about one inch in length only.  i got many compliments and my husband said it was beautiful- that's a plus! i was comfortable and cool all day.  get it before it is out of stock.  this dress will not make it to sale.",5
The most amazingly versatile cardi you'll ever own! it goes with everything from boyfriend jeans and booties to black chiffon pleated skirt. it's soft and feminine and makes you feel like you look like a million dollars! definitely worth the price.,5
This is a beautiful top which runs tts and armholes are not too big for once. i typically struggle with armholes being way too big on me and have to size down in most tops and this top runs tts and armholes are perfect. no bra showing beneath. yay! it is a beautiful color and design. just love it. i am a typical size 4/6 and size 6 was perfect. i am 36c and no problems in bust area. works well with my short torso. highly recommend. i think it will look great on all body types.,5
"The color pattern in this material pops a lot more in person than on the website. fits perfectly, very versatile regardless of the occasion or the season (at least in california!). love it.",5
"This is the most beautiful dress! so many beautiful patterns, the zipper across the front and belt across the front is so flattering and sexy. beautiful flower applique on the hips. everything about this dress is magnificent!",5
Loving this jumpsuit! i normally a medium top small bottom i bought the medium it fits right. soft fabric and nice color.,5
"This sweater caught my eye months ago, and i recently picked it up on sale at a great price. it reminds me of something betty draper would wear on mad men; it has a fabulous 1960s feel to it. and, everyone loves pockets! i love the combination of peachy pink and cream, and the sweater it quite warm. the fit is good, although on me, the buttons gap slightly (this is easily remedied by wearing a shirt underneath, as shown on the model). i'm already dreaming up lots of fun outfit combinations!",5
"This dress fits very nicely, i didn't keep it as i have too many dresses, but loved the fit. hip was a little looser compared to the top, you can almost see it on the model if you look closely, the dies poke out a bit. the teal color is very flattering on my pale skin tone. love the back, you can actually zip it all the way (mid back) with the tie in the neck, leaving a nice cutout... 0p fit me (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist) 30 dd).",5
This precious skirt is a treasure chest of soft bronze fabric circles scattered like coins at the bottom of a fountain. the circles are a bronze color and cannot be felt through the skirt net. it's finely finished and simply a nice piece for dinner out or a day in the office. i received many compliments on my first wearing.,5
"I can't say enough good things about this piece. high quality in structure and design. when i initially put it on i worried that i might have ordered a size too small. so i was pleasantly surprised to realize this dress fits like a glove but has enough give in all of the right places to let you eat, dance, breath, etc. i received tons of compliments.
of note, i am 128 lbs and 5/5 - i wore a size 4.
wanting another event that i can wear this to as i wore it to a work xmas party.",5
"This has a wonderful texture and feel to it. the leather dots are supple, and the tulle is soft and flowey. it's long, more like a midi skirt, and the color is more towards taupe than ivory.
with a shimmer, this skirt is very fun to wear.",5
"I love this shirt and although it is see through a tank works great under it to wear to work. the buttons on the back are sewn on really well and it comes down far enough/ is not too short. i am about 5'4"" and 100 pounds. the 00 was tight on my neck so i kept a 0. otherwise the 00 would have fit fine since its a blousy shirt and would not have been too tight in the shoulders or armpits.",5
I bought this top in taupe and love the style. it's not too boxy or long. cotton is always a plus and i just wish there were more colors.,5
"I adore this skirt - it is so soft and flowy. i was not sure if the mesh would be a bit stiff, but it's not at all. the dots are soft as is the main fabric. i could wear this all day long and be very comfy. the underlying fabric is a bit more taupe than gold in color. i am between sizes to i sized up and was glad i did- no pinch at the waist. i love that it's feminine yet funky and could be worn formally or in fun. it is midi-length, as you see on the model. absolutely a great buy!",5
"Dress looks beautiful, but the fitting is very off. i ordered a size 2 which is the dress size i usually wear ( i'm 5;4 and 115lbs). the chest area fits perfectly, but the hip area is extremely tight and the lower back area was lose. i exchanged it for a 4, the hip area was a bit tight and the shoulders were too lose. if i ordered the 4p, i have a feeling it would be too tight. it feels like, it's meant for someone with very small hips and a large abdomen. also, this dress is very stiff, can't d",1
"I had four weddings this fall and tried this dress on but ended up not purchasing because i already had dresses to wear. but, i told myself i would purchase the dress if it ever went on sale. i don't have an occasion to wear it yet but i can't wait! the dress is so lovely and the details are beautiful. the only thing i'm worried about is the possibility for some of the embroidered parts to pill. it looks very flattering and hugs all my curves beautifully.",5
"I bought this for a wedding i will attend 10 months from now. when i saw this dress on sale, i just need to get it! it was simply gorgeous!!! it fitted so well. it makes one feel so special. i like the addition of the belt.",5
"Most casual tops are so sloppy now - not this one! great cut, wish there were more color options.",5
"This skirt manages to be both sophisticated and whimsical. it's well-made, classy, feminine, and timeless. love it!",5
"I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this shirt. it's comfortable, the fit is excellent and flattering, and it can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. i bought it in the brown and the black and have no regrets.",5
"The dress is very beautiful and looks expensive. it will make a nice wedding dress. it does run quite small though. i am 5'2"" and 90-95lbs with a straight figure, but the 00p was too constricting.",5
"Wow, this dress is so incredibly designed and made! the style is a subtle showstopper - classic and beautiful like they don't make anymore.
the inside of the dress is so well constructed, it has its own beauty!

i read that it ran a little large, so i tried the 0 and the 00, since i usually wear a 0. well the 00 looked like a lingerie commercial with the dress unable to zip above the waist!! the 0 fit and zipped, but i could not sit down comfortably. yikes!
the 2 was a winner. i'm 5'4 1/2"", 110",5
"I love this skirt. unfortunately, no petite sizing was available when it was affordable (on sale). i purchased the 6 regular (based on ""small waist"" reviews) thinking i'll just have it shortened. did not realize there are 4 layers and tailoring would have cost $60+. was considering anyway, but when pinned up, the skirt lost its fullness and i didn't care for that look. if anyone has a 6 petite they want to off-load or exchange with me for a 6 regular, am very happy to do so. this is one skirt i",5
"You've probably read through the other reviews, so i'll try not to repeat too much:
__________
pros:
- it is lightweight and flows beautifully, flattering every sort of shape and frame.
- the leather circles throughout are darling and seem to be fairly secure (some of mine were a bit bent upon receipt).
- the color is subtle yet not understated. it just works. not sheer, lining throughout that isn't itchy and some tulle on top of the lining to give it a bounce and fuller shape.
- color is more t",5
"These coveralls are not cut long enough, i am long in the body and it is very hard for me to find coveralls overalls that are long enough and these unfortunately are the same. i have large breast so that adds to the problem so when i stand sideways and look at the waistband the front you can see is pulled up where the back is hanging lower. they really are nice, my first thought when i put them kn was wow i look a tad like michael myers in them but they're really very cool.....wish i could keep",5
"I did not have to size up or down because of my body type (broad padded back, wide rib cage, narrow hips, small bum.) however, it fits a little odd on me. the back darts that start at the waist and are supposed to curve for your behind settle too high and wrinkle. the waist is also too high. the shoulders are a bit tight. i am confused because i bought the exact same size pieced brocade (the colorful version of this dress) and that one actually fits spot on. i have a feeling if i go to the store",5
"Unique and stylish dress, looks much better on than in the pictures.",5
"I bought this dress to wear at a bridal shower and absolutely love it! the color was perfect and the petite-xs was true to its size. the top was a bit on the tight side with my arms but overall incredibly comfortable. i would buy more in this style and size, but not having enough occasions to wear the style. it's great for wedding guests, cocktail hours, or even work.",5
"Saw this skirt in the store, but the size was wrong. i am normally a 0 or 2 at retailer, but i was afraid that the 2 would be just too much material, so i ordered the 0, and boy, am i glad.
elegant, can go from day to night with the right shoes and accessories.
anticipating many compliments.",5
"This is such a cute little top that can be easily worn off the shoulder or on the shoulders. it is comfortable, soft and quite flattering. it hangs nicely and is a pretty white top that will come in handy this spring and summer. i stayed tts on this one but could have sized down.",5
"Wonderful summer blouse!. prefect with jeans or shorts. very flattering on my older, curvy body.",5
"The most important thing to note about this skirt is that it is a true blue color- not black! it's also perfect for spring , summer and early fall. super comfy, casual yet elegant. size runs a tiny bit small as the waist is not elasticized. a staple of a cozy chic wardrobe.",5
I am so in love with this top. can be worn on or off the shoulders. the color is amazing!,5
I'm always on the search for a comfortable shirt with style. this does not disappoint. super comfy and flattering. love.,5
"Very comfortable and super cute. the top sold out, which i'm bummed about, but matched it with a funky black top.",5
"I have worn this to work, errands, yoga. it's a great tee. love it!",5
"I love this top, beautiful soft fabric , much prettier than picture, can be worn on or off shoulders. extremely flattering, falls to a perfect length , great with shorts, pants or a long skirt.",5
"Most flattering and perfect dark skinny jean! obsessed is an understatement. i am becoming a big fan of mother denim! just enough stretch to be comfortable all day, sit a little bit higher on my waist, which is wonderful (post babies) and sometimes hard to find in jeans. if you are in between sizes, be sure to size down! these jeans are stretchy to begin with and will stretch out a whole size. i have never been happier with a pair of jeans!",5
"The colors are vibrant and the beading is beautifully simple and nicely done. i waited quite a few months for this dress but it was worth the wait! it's loose fitting, but still gives you some shape without looking like you are wearing a potato sack!",5
This top is too cute and shows just the right amount of skin without being overt. it can be worn on or off the shoulder and is just enough to cover a tummy without looking maternity. i can't wait for the warmer weather to get here and stay so i can wear this top more often!,5
This shirt is a great way to rock the off the shoulder trend. you can dress it up or down bi would definitely recommend it.,5
Great tee! flows well and very soft. true to size!,5
This dress is a bit longer than photographed but i was totally ok with that. the skirt is also a bit fuller which makes the dress more formal. it's really well made and great material. i'm 5'6 123lb and bought a size 4.,5
"Love this shirt! i have it in both colors. you can wear it off the shoulder or on. it's baggy enough it looks great with skinny jeans, i recently had a double mastectomy and wore this shirt a lot as it is baggy enough, you couldn't see i had drains underneath my tank top. i am really grateful for this shirt! super soft, super cute!",5
"I was looking for a simplistic dress because i am graduating in a few weeks but did not really want to purchase anything. i strolled in the store and this immediately caught my eye. i tried it on and fell in love!! it fits perfectly and it is the right length. i love the bust line and the detailing of the straps in the back. i don't think i feel as though i am going to a wedding,but i will feel beautiful especially since this is really big deal and accomplishment. i am an older adult - so i want",5
I love this shirt. i have it in red. i found the fit tts and looks great casually with a scarf or dressed up with a nice necklace. you can't go wrong with a cute shirt that is soft. i like the length goes just past my bottom in the back but not overwhelming.,5
"I purchased the blue color and it's gorgeous. i'm 5'7"" and the length is perfect, not too billowy and not too tight. the fabric is a nice gauzy, summer weight.",5
"I just adore these shorts from art dept. they are casual, yet slightly structured. the length is just perfect (for me), no ride up, no wrinkles (i can't stand wrinkled shorts), and the fringe gives these shorts a fun and playful look just perfect for a stroll on the beach or shopping with your girlfriends. i know these shorts are going to be a staple in my summer wardrobe for years. can i have these in more colors and patterns too????",5
"I saw this in the store and fell in love with it! i normally wear between a 29 and 30 in pants and the medium fit great. it is a very generous cut in the leg and the waist has an elastic band in the back. i'm 5'5"" and the pants almost graze the top of my foot, perfect for sandals. if i had seen this stock photo first i would have been totally off-put by the culotte length, but i guess that's what it looks like on a model! there are cute buttons that run down the outside length of the pants and t",5
"I first saw this shirt online and decided to see it in person. so happy i did! i never would have picked it up in the store. it looks much better on than on the hanger. it is so flattering! you can wear it on or off the shoulders and although it is a boxy shirt, it somehow makes you look slim! wow! i took my usual medium. highly recommend!",5
"I bought this top in the purple color but i believe it to be more of a cobalt. it is a beautiful color! i wore it to dinner the same night i purchased it. my husband said he loved the color and style. i wear either a s or m in retailer tops, depending on the brand. with this one i chose a small and it's fits perfectly. i have a petite frame; 5'2"", 123 lbs., but with a 32f bust. it is very flattering, as with most off the shoulder tops. they say your shoulders never age :) the length is just right",5
"I l o v e this sleeveless blouse for is soft tranquil print, wearability from day to night, comfort and fit! the design is flirty yet sophisticated-i wear it with skirts for work and jeans by night. can't say enough good things! everyone should have this beautiful piece in their wardrobe!",5
"I ordered this dress to wear to a mid summer evening wedding. i love it. i think it will be fun, and it is unexpected for me. i will need to order a smaller size.i am 5'-5"" and almost always wear a 4 in retailer wear. this ran a little big on the top, i will be ordering a 2 and sending one back",5
Love these basic t's because there is always a unique cut out which makes them more interesting. fit and wash well.,5
"I purchased this in the ""purple"" which is more blue than purple, but you can definitely see the purplish hue depending on the light. it's a beautiful, rich indigo color. it's very comfortable. i usually go for more fitted styles, but i was pleasantly surprised at how flattering this top is even though the body of the shirt is more loose fitting. i'm very excited to wear this top this summer. i haven't worn and washed it yet, so i am hoping the color and material will hold up after washing. i am",5
"I'm not sure why they call this ""black"" because what you see in this pictures depicted is pretty much the shade in person. the fabric itself is lovely. it made my wider hips look smaller! :)

cons:
- material is thin, not for winter a",5
"Best jumpsuit ever! so soft and always gets compliments! get one now before they're gone. also it is supposed to be tied in front! i'm 5'3"" and the small petite is just perfect!",5
"Great little spring top. the fabric is soft and the drape is of the fabric is just right. it is very loose without making it look like a maternity top and the length hits me right at the top of the hipbone. for reference i am in my 50's, 5'1"" and weigh in the150's. i normally wear medium size and this one was no exception. the blue is a beautiful cobalt color.",5
I am super happy with the t-shirt....it fits true to size and the cut outs are a great detail!! i'm thinking about buying another!!,5
"This shirt looked so perfect on the model, and i was so excited to get it! when i received it, it was so soft and the color was so vibrant. the only thing is, it's too big. it kind of looks like a maternity shirt. it will definitely have to be taken in on the sides for me, but i'm happy with it other than that. i'm normally a l/xl but m would have been perfect this time.",5
"Even on sale i was hesitant about paying so much for a blouse, but i'm so happy i did! the fabric looks as high quality in-person as it does in the picture, and it isn't see-through. the main color of the top is less powder pink and more nude in my opinion, but the color is lovely and the various purples and grays of the arrow details really pop. the buttons down the back are a fun, cute detail, and tone down the more professional look of this blouse in order to wear it with jeans for going out.",5
Picked this up at the store in my usual size small. it fit perfectly. i am a 34d and the buttons closed with no gap. the length was just above the ankle and the fit is slim. so comfy. my guess is this is going to sell out because everyone including the sa's wanted to buy one. loved the color too~very versatile.,5
"I picked this up unexpectedly and whisked it into the dressing room a long with a handful of other things today.
i noticed right away how soft it was! so comfy! i have never owned a romper before so i wasn't expecting to like it--- i was so wrong, i'm sorry romper! i love you!
i plan on debuting this little number with a cropped cream cardigan jacket and taupe booties and some layered necklaces for my brother in law's casual weddingrehearsal dinner. 
living in las vegas though, i can definite",5
"These pants are extremely comfortable and flattering. i bought them in coral, and wore with a black peasant top, sandals and a long necklace. they do stretch out a lot though, so i would recommend sizing down. i bought mine to look like they fit on the model, and after a few hours they were hanging off of me, so buy them a little bit tighter than you like. the drawstring is purely decorative and does not tighten the waist.",5
"Love these pants i bought them in two colors! flattering fitting!! im 5'4 120lbs 36"" hip. i bought these in size 25. sometimes i don't like petit sizing but these petite at 30"" long inseam still gave me enough length to wear with heals. there is the usual good and bad with linen - after you wear them once you need to iron because they look too wrinkled and worn. the linen is light and washed - unfortunately i don't think these pants will hold up for more than a two years. i'll love them while i",5
"Just received this dress today. i bought it for a vacation we are taking to mexico. i wanted a nice coverup.
this is beautiful. fits nicely without looking like a tent.
i would highly recommend. 
this is one size fits all.",5
"Love this sweater.. fits perfect, flattering and soft. i got it in both colors. it is a true staple!",5
"This jumpsuit is very comfortable. the material is soft the waist is elasticised, it is not drawstring as it seems in the photos.",5
"A perfect go-to top. looks great with jeans - dark , faded or bright white. top it with a cardigan or wear it bare - it offers a flattering fit with its high-quality, textured fabric. i normally wear a small or medium top. an extra-small fits me perfectly.",5
"Absolutely love this dress. maeve dresses have always been constructed with great care and quality. i am and always have been a size med in maeve dresses. the dress is soft and flowing. the fabric is very forgiving and moves with you. i recommend trying on a dress by this maker . . . their cuts are consistent, so i feel extremely confident in buying their clothes online. this is a keeper and can be worn year round.",5
"The photos do not do this skirt justice! i'm so glad i picked it up in the store, as i would not have given it a second look online. it is soft, stretchy, forgiving, and one of the most versatile pieces in my closet! i dressed it up for an evening event and can't wait to throw it on with a tee and jean jacket! love it!",5
"When i first saw the bees embroidered pullover in the store, it instantly caught my attention. since it was pricey, i didn't get it. when it went on sale, it ran out in my size. so recently i was fortunate enough to get the same style embroidered birds pullover in the store for 20% off the sale price. this shirt looks so adorable on and is different than the typical sweatshirt.",5
"I love everything about this jumper - it's so comfortable without being too warm. it's easy to dress up with booties and a hat. i suppose the only possible downside is that it's slightly tight at the ankles, but honestly - this is like a dream.",5
"This is adorable! i got it to wear on the plane for an upcoming vacation. this is definitely tts. i am normally a medium and got the medium. i am long wasted and this fit just fine. looks like it does on the model.
the material is super soft too. it is also easy to get on and off which is sometimes difficult with rompers.
plan on wearing it with gladiator sandals and a jean jacket.",5
This jumpsuit is so so comfy i can't wait to wear it! def runs on the large size.,5
"I loved this top so much, i ended up buying both of the designs. they are so cute and eye catching, and the layered look is really fun. it fit me very well.",5
"I ordered this skirt in a size small and when i received it, not only was it too long, but there was also a hole in it. so i returned it. when a small petite became available, i ordered it thinking it would fit better. i just received it and there is a hole in this skirt as well. both skirts also looked as if they had been worn; there was fuzz and lint all over the skirts. i like the skirt but i either have extremely bad luck or it's really bad quality.",1
"I tried these on in the store today and fell in love. they fit/drape beautifully and are incredibly comfortable while looking stylish. i'm 5'7"" and 128 lbs. and the 27 (a 4, i guess) fit perfectly. sadly, i can't afford them full price so will keep my eye on them in case they go on sale.",5
Great elastic fit...might size down. i'm usually a size 2 in bottoms or a 26 in jeans and i bought the xs. it's perfect and goes great with boots!,5
"I love this sweater!! love the length, it's a bit loose and delicate compared to what i usually wear, but looks great with boots and leggings. love the sheer fabric across the bottom of the back, the loose bows on the sides and the drape of the fabric. all combine to make a great sweater. runs true to size, has a loose fit but you don't feel like you are drowning in fabric like some loose fitting cardigans.",5
Love! love! love! i got this jumper right before it started getting hot and it has been my go to all summer! fun night out with the girls.. perfect! walking around the mall... awesome! at work with a green vest... super! every time i wear this i get tons of compliments! did i mention it feels like you're wearing pajamas which in my book is everything! get it!,5
"I purchased both colors offered and love this light weight full of neat detail piece to layer with other tops. the material is very soft and stretchy making it easy to wear over another item. i love the little shirt tail detail in back along with the drawstring trim in front. another piece that i am sure i will wear for years to come and the fit is true to size.
thanks antro!",5
I love this sweater!!! it's so fun and quirky and shakes up a regular sweater. a little large but it fits the style.,5
"Just love sweatshirts & ponchos, so what an unusual twist of style! ordered my usual size s during the promo. looks pretty much as in the pic. oversized arm openings are created by a string attached to the sides of the garment. it's ok but may eventually break off. maybe i'll secure w/ snaps or just sew it on by hand. wore it yesterday w/ just a tank underneath to lounge around. later wore for casual dining. it turned cooler & changed to a grey t-shirt underneath along w/ dark blue denim skinnys",5
I purchased the bird design top for my 17 year old daughter. the fit was true to size and it's a very unique item for casual wear. it looks nicer in person than in the photo.,5
"I'm a big fan of level 99 jeans and linen pants. these are great-- good quality, flattering fit, lovely color. i got the coral in size 26/petite, and that works for me. they do start out just a bit snug in the seat when i first put them on, but they'll pretty quickly stretch out just enough to maintain shape without becoming baggy, like my other level 99 linens-- something to keep in mind when trying to find your right fit. i was a little worried that the drawstring meant there wouldn't be much",5
"I do love this shirt, but when it arrived, it had makeup around the collar, apparently from someone else who had tried it on. i was able to clean it up with just soap and water so no big problem, but it did make for a poor first impression!",5
"I love this sweater! it is very lightweight- the knit is a wider weave, so if you are cold natured be sure to layer and bring a jacket. the fit is great, it is very flattering on. the back is lined and has the gray fabric that shows past the sweater hemline which adds to the uniqueness. this could be dressed up or down- i paired with a white tee and dark jeans and flats but will wear it next with nice pants and maybe a white collared blouse. very happy with my purchase!",5
Love this skirt. very comfy. looks like it's very expensive material but feels comfortable.,5
Love this dress.  the color is beautiful.  runs large so size down,5
"The pictures are not showing how absolutely spectacular this caftan is. it is very delicate (even says so on the tag) and lightweight so that you won't dread wearing it in the heat of the day. by what doesn't show up is that this caftan shimmers-there is gold string woven throughout the entire garment which gives it a slight sheen. it adds significantly to the impact of the garment, and i love this detail. i love the way this caftan drapes, and i love that it is longer than a normal caftan. the",5
"I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of the other reviews but so glad i did! i usually wear a 4-6 and the 6 fit great. it feels like high quality and i think the shirt will work well for both work and casual events. i have a long torso and don't find it too short at all. it is a tad tight across the shoulders, so if you are broad in that area, it might not work for you. overall, love!",5
This is the most beautiful bathing suit ive ever owned. it is so unique and comfortable. the fit and everything is just amazing. so happy with this purchase.,5
"I love this blouse. i debated because of the cost. but this is a top i will wear forever. i have not found any of the issues other reviewers have. fit fine in the arms and the length was perfect and i have a long torso. i wear it with a nude bra and i don't have any problems with its being see through. i wore it to a party the other day and received several compliments. i was also stopped in the store and asked where i got it. it looks expensive and special. i worn it with jean, black jeans and",5
"I love this shirt, bought it at the store. i have a few shirts from this brand so i knew how it would fit. i love the colors in this short, it's very spring and light weight! love it very much!",5
"This shirt is so beautiful and fits perfectly. it is so soft too, i didn't expect it to be so soft!",5
"Love this swimsuit. runs true to size. definitely recommend. very flattering. for reference i have a straight/athletic build, i'm 5'11"", 150, 34c, and size 8 was great for top and bottom.",5
"The tops looks fitted on the model because she pressed her arms against the clothes. to my surprise,
the tops actually is very very very r o o m y below the chest area.
the appliques/laces on the front are made of low quality materials.",1
"I love this top! it is modest enough for work, but fun enough for weekends. soft, comfortable, and lovely pink color. i want it in every color! (it seems to only come in two colors, though.)
soft flowy fabric, is lined with a soft inner fabric as well. super flattering for any body type!",5
"This is a true tiny top........gorgeous and runs small. i usually wear a small or medium in retailer tops, but timy i always size up. i'm a 36c, and a large fits perfect. the front is a bit sheer, but not so much you need a cami.",5
Love this top! very feminine and looks cute with heels and jeans or can be worn more casually too!,5
"Bought this in the silvery grey color in the store yesterday, and i have to say the photos don't do this top justice. it hangs beautifully, is nicely lined, and is well made. i will leave the ties hanging rather than tied. it isn't too long, but long enough and has a nice swing. i'm short waisted and large breasted and this top is super flattering on me!",5
"Hi, i love this top. it not only is femine but it is wee bit sexy. it could be worn in the office then out for happy hour",5
"For me, this is the perfect tshirt. love the shape, size, material etc. just really like it. flattering and good quality.",5
"This is one of my favorite tops! i have it in two colors. it's almost like a swing look, yet it still feels like it gives me a shape to my body. very easily paired with a skinny jean. i paid full price for th two, but now i'm sure i'll buy the third on sale!",5
The pullover is very light weight material so great for fall or spring. it hangs nicely in front and back and is slimming. i ordered a medium other than the sleeves are not as long on me as the model it fits perfectly.,5
"Beautiful and comfortable, although it is a lot looser at the bottom than pictured, and the slit on the sides is quite high. not deal breakers though!",5
Such a pleasant surprise. i saw this in the store and had to try it on. it looks and feels like a lightweight real suede. the color is a wonderful neutral-much prettier than what i am seeing in the pic here. fits tts. although i will wear 0-2 petites in dresses and some pants i found the regular xs to be just right.,5
"I was able to purchase this on sale and i'm so glad i did. i usually go between a size s and m (133 lbs., 5' 5"", 34 d) but the small fits perfectly. the color really isn't dark orange as stated......kind of a cross between rose/pale red/ salmon but i really love the color. it's not super heavy weight but not really thin either....actually perfect!",5
These shorts were beautiful!! love the material and the way they fit. the drawstring makes them very adjustable.,5
"I ordered a bunch of clothing from retailer last week, and this is by far my favorite purchase! the detail is gorgeous, it's very soft, and figure flattering.",5
"Softest cardigan i've had in a long time! fits a little bit on the large side, especially in the sleeve length, but who doesn't love a big cozy sweater? this is a great way to add some color to any fall outfit. highly recommend this one. all i wish is that it came in more colors!!",5
It turned out exactly as i'd hoped - very well made and very classy!,5
"This jacket is the best! definitely my staple jacket for the spring. it is so comfortable and soft. i usually wear a small in retailer clothing, but i opted for the medium in this so there's a little room for layering. even with the extra room, it is so flattering. i absolutely love this jacket!",5
"I love the idea of this shirt, but the execution is absolutely horrible. i ordered online and what i received is just a mess. the stitching at the bottom has big globs of black thread. not just a few hanging off, but literally big clumps. a large portion of the stitching on the whole shirt looks like it should be on the underside of the shirt as the where the thread is tied off is on the outside!! the fit is just as big a mess. i always have to buy a large in fitted shirts because i have very br",1
"Love the short in the front, long in the back look. it has an almost glittery look. really roomy, i would size down. really comfy and pretty!",5
Fits nicely and made with high-quality material. it definitely makes you look very put together with some nice slacks for work. the scarf is a very nice detail and actually doesn&#39;t look like it is a part of the shirt. love!,5
"I have other stevies, and these are nothing like them. the quality is very synthetic to a point that the material is shiny. the pants themselves run very small in the waist, approx. two sizes too small compared with other stevies. additionally, the cuff is sewn like that in place, and hits at an odd spot if you are taller or have strong calves. see how it gapes in the cuff on the model? like, a rounded bottom? that is way more emphasized in real life. buyer beware!",1
"This jacket is as cute as it looks in the picture, color is very close too. i normally wear a 4-6 top (sometimes s sometimes m). the small looked great until i tried to raise my arms - the cut runs a bit small acrossed the back). i love this jacket though! the m fits nicely and i highly recommend it!",5
"Bought this in store at full price: it's that pretty. black & white, embroidery, pintucks! throw it on with capris and flats and you are polished and comfy. my only prob was i had to buy a little large - size 8- as size 6 was already sold out. 
i am 5' 5"" , 130 lbs.",5
"This is a gorgeous shirt. it actually looks more fitted on than in this picture, where it looks more shapeless. even though i love tunics, the online picture wasn't appealing to me -- but when i saw the shirt in store and tried it on i loved it. wore it to work today and loved it even more. it's great quality, gorgeous design, lovely tailoring and details throughout.",5
"I have many pairs of ag jeans -- mostly stevie's & harper's -- and while they're comfortable, i am always glad to take them off at the end of the day. these jeans are different. the fabric is very, very soft & feels like it's been washed & worn dozens of times. but the color & finish of the jean looks polished & spiffy enough to wear for evenings out or casual friday. and the fit is perfect, once i went up a size. slim and figure hugging but not at all constricting. my regular stevie's always fe",5
"I have several pairs of ag jeans and am always pleased with them. i had to get these when i saw them in the store. i'm a sucker for cuffed jeans in the spring. i also love the dark wash. i was surprised when i tried on my usual size 27 that they were too tight. i ended up going with a size 28. for reference i am 5'4, 122 lbs.",5
"This dress is perfect for weekend errands or i could see dressing it up as well. the material is a heavier weight, will not wrinkle and the pockets are an added bonus. i purchased the small in this dress and it is perfect. for reference: 32d, 27, 35",5
"These jeans are one of my all time favorite ag jeans. comfortable denim, dark rinse. wide cuffs are fashionable but still classy. wear them all the time!",5
"I had been looking for a jacket like this for months, but haven't found the right style, until i saw this one! luckily it was on sale. i am 5'10, weigh ca. 143lb's and i usually wear a size small in all retailer tops. tried on medium, but it was too big in the bust area., then i tried on the small and it fits great! the sleeves are long enough too, but it is hard to move my arms up to reach something, so i just have to avoid that. :) i have gotten a lot of compliments for it.",5
"This sweater is more stunning in person then on the site. i saw it on the internet previous to seeing in the store. i purchased it right away, it was love at first sight!!. the detail on the collar is beautiful, and reminds me of the unique sweaters i have have in my closet from retailer from years ago that i still love. get it before it's gone!!!!",5
"This dress fits well and the material allows for hiding lumps and bumps. material is heavy, yet soft. i could see wearing it with sneakers as the model is, or dressing it up with jewelry and heels. this will be a perfect dress to take on vacation, as it won't get wrinkled and it is so versatile. i'm normally a size 4-8 depending on clothing item, and i bought this in a size small. fits perfect. for reference, i am 38-26-38.",5
"I bought this in store yesterday in a 2 petite - it definitely looks best if you can get it in your usual size (4 petite just looked too big and changes the look). love the embroidery detail. it was on display with the sleeves rolled up to elbows, and it's really cute that way too.",5
"I love these jeans. they are very comfortable and do not stretch excessively after wear. i found the cut to be very flattering and the material to be heavy enough to hold its shape while still having enough give to move around and chase after little ones. they look great paired with a v-neck and flats or cute blouses and heels. a great buy! like another reviewer i, too, found these ran a little small and went up a size.",5
"I love this sweater jacket! found it on the sale rack in a medium and fits like a medium would fit from my adored retailer! i am 5,4' inches and 34dd chest and curvy 145 lbs. the knitted detailed collar is a show stopper and what makes this item look like an an old school retailer item. the color is really not orange but more of a vintage rose with hints of rust and soft shades of pink. i love this color and i think it would look beautiful on many skin tones. i paired it with a pink blouse from anth",5
"This is way shinier in person than i expected, but i like it. there are gold threads throughout which stand out. i love shiny things so i was pleasantly surprised. i agree that you could size down if you wanted, but it looks cute roomy and loose i think. really soft. i will wear this to the park or dressed up for dinner. love the double duty aspect. i'm a little bummed about the fabric content, but that's it.",5
"The knit collar and the color and the drape is what makes this lilitz cardigan so wonderful and an excellent addition to my signature retailer sweater collection. as previous reviewers stated, the color is not orange but more of a marled rose yarn. the body of the sweater is lightweight, draped, stretchy and warm and the knit collar is much heavier. because of my body type (36ddd, heavy upper back, rounded shoulders) this cardigan doesn't look great on me when left open as the collar doesn't fall",5
I finally found these jeans!! love them and have been wearing them almost everyday!,5
"I ordered this shirt with some trepidation after reading the one-star reviews. i was, however, pleasantly surprised when the shirt arrived and i put it on. i agree the sleeves are a bit on the slim side, noticeable mostly because the fabric doesn't have any give. the shirt fabric itself is both billowy and substantial and the embroidery work gives the shirt an expensive (because it is) and unique look. the shirt body is not as slim cut as it appears in the pictures; the darts open out to a much",5
I really liked this cardigan. it is well made and very pretty. i will wear it when it gets a little cooler in early fall because i tried to wear it on one of these really hot days and it felt little too warm.,5
"This cardigan is a beautiful - not too thin, but soft and versatile. the cutouts add a nice unique detail. i was worried that the cuts might fray, but they actually have a very thin bit of glue to prevent fraying. really beautiful piece for those of us with cold summer offices :)",5
"Love the fit and feel of the fabric. says to dry but i found the leg seams did bunch up a bit so next time i won't dry them, i'll hang to dry. very cute style. super comfy.",5
Love these pants. also ordered them in blue. great fit and style.,5
"Just bought this dress in a 6. i'm 5'7"" 138 lbs (32b, 29 in jeans). this is *so* much better than pictured. it's an empire waist that really flatters my small bust and accentuates the thin part of the waist. i have an hourglass figure, but can see this working great for pear shapes. i wish the material felt softer, but the fit was so perfect, even for my broad shoulders. will transition nicely to warmer weather, but for now, i plan to wear it with leggings and a cardigan.",5
"This is the perfect casual yet stylish dress. and, it's extremely comfortable!",5
"The model pose does not do this dress justice. it is super flattering, and the fabric is a thick light fabric, can't explain it.. the pattern is simply adorable, i can't figure out why this one is on sale while other colors aren't as in my opinion, this is the nicest one.

fits true to size as in my lower range. i tried on both pettie and regular and went with regular. petite was too short for me. i went with size 0 and am 5'1.5 and weight about 115.",5
"Just picked up this cardigan in the heather charcoal - so i can wear it in the fall and winter. the design on the border is well done and will show off whatever you wear under this cardi. sleeves are snug and long, but can easily be pushed up to 3/4 length.",5
"As another review said, the model's pose doesn't do this dress justice and i can't believe this is on sale. i picked this up this weekend at my local store. it fits wonderfully, very flattering. the fabric feels good and i'm fairly certain won't wrinkle too easily which is going to make this the perfect dress for packing for a trip. dress it up with boots for dinner, dress it down with sandals for day. this is a steal, get it! (i'm 5'8"", ~145, the size 8 fit perfect)",5
"This cardigan is very similar to the c keer wrapped asters cardigan from a few years ago....i have this cardigan and have loved wearing it; i think it only came in cream color. unfortunately, i caught the cutouts a few times, and the cutouts are slightly ripped in 2 spots...not very noticeable, but i know they're there! so i was delighted to see that retailer brought back this cardigan, this time from meadow rue. i purchased both the cream and gray colors in a size small....i am usually a s",5
This dress is so much better in person. i would say it is tts but it was oddly baggy around the chest/armpit area which didn't deter me from keeping it. the biggest negative i have is that it is rayon but i don't think that'll change with retailers anytime soon.,5
"Loved the styling, versatility, fit & quality of this top! length was good, not too fitted, perfect piece under cardigans & jackets. will look great with jeans, leggings or skirt. very happy with this purchase.",5
I bought an retailer cami 10 years ago and it is still in good shape so i looked on the website to see if they still carried them and they did! i bought 3 i was so excited!,5
Great addition to wardrobe ...have already worn a lot. soft and lightweight.,5
The colors of this top are even better in person. the blue is easy to pair with denim and there is no need to accessorize -- the print does all the talking! it is a bit wide on the bottom and the print material is pretty thin. it definitely looks like something not everyone else has - worth the splurge.,5
"This is a beautiful cardi. the cutouts and the full front panels all make it stand out. that said, there are 2 minor flows imo worthy of mentioning, none diminish my satisfaction toward it though. the sleeves are slim, meaning no long-sleeve shirts under it, for me at least. the fabric is a bit ""catchy"", meaning you'd better wear something silky or slippery under so the fabric doesn't crumple up behind your back. nevertheless, i will have so many uses for it 

last, but not the least, is my sa",5
"Love these pants- they are so soft and comfortable- do not fall down like low rise trousers.  i like the length for wearing with flats - most wide bottom pants are too long, and these are very casual to be worn with flats.",5
"I love this top! the colors are beautiful & look incredible with jeans as well as so many of the different color pilcro pants in my closet. it's the perfect between-season item.
since i don't like garments that have a ""boxy"" fit, i was concerned that this top wouldn't work for me after reading some of the other reviews. but it looks great & feels comfy.",5
I got this in the brown and absolutely love it. this is perfect for cool weather. i'm super particular about fabric quality and this cardigan does not disappoint,5
"The top looks better on the model than in-person. it fits loose and looks boxy and matronly. i don't like the sleeve length or the top style, it just didn't look flattering or good. i am sending it back. looks very boxy.",1
This is a beautiful top! extremely classy. looks great with dressy trousers or jeans. drapes very nicely. the petite medium fits me perfectly (5'1 126 lb). love it! the embroidery ads so much. so pleased with this purchase!,5
"I hesitantly ordered this cardigan after it spent weeks in my basket. i love it! i am usually ""large"" by retailer brand standards at 5'4"" 145 lbs, but the small fit quite big and i'm glad i didn't go for the larger one. it is super unique and cozy. i gave it a 3 on quality because the knit is a bit itchy and the fibers do come off on other layers. it also is longer than i expected, it hits about my mid thigh.",5
Love the design and print. absolutely beautiful bathing suit. would size up on the bottoms. top is true to size.,5
"I tried this on in the store, and i found my regular medium to be a bit too boxy. i ended up going with the petite large because i found it just fit better. it wasn't too wide and fit just right.
it is very soft, not itchy at all. it says dry clean only but it did great on my hand wash setting with cold water. laid it out to dry. great purchase.",5
"Got this in the blue and was so excited. while it looks cute, someone had clearly bought this, worn it, and returned it. it had human and dog hair all over it. not to mention some kind of red strings. it was pilling all over. so much for quality control!!! i don't mind buying used things but at least clean it up and give me a discount!",1
"This top is beautiful, really special. i am a 32dd and this type of flowy top sometimes doesn't work for me but this one is fine. looks great with skinny jeans and boots or flats.",5
"This top is so cute and of spectacular quality, but you have to size up! i'm a 10/m/34c all the time. i almost never have to size up or down. but this top was so tight around the bust that i couldn't possibly have closed the zipper in the back. i'm sending it back for a l in the hopes of a better fit. the coloring of the owls is out-of-this-world cute, so i'm keeping my fingers crossed that a larger size will be just right.",5
"This sweater is gorgeous...it is of great quality and very warm. i was very excited and wanted it to look great. however....i have a large bust and am full figured...so it was not appealing and just kind of ""hung there"". i feel that it would look great on thinner women...and it is a gorgeous sweater...just not for me!",5
"Gorgeous blouse, but a touch too large. i may return and try a small.",5
"This blouse is very flattering. it drapes well and i love the textures. only problem is the head hole is a little small so if you buy the white one, put your makeup on after you have it on and remove your makeup before sliding it off. i bought an extra small even though i'm usually a small. lovely top. a lot of people have commented on it.",5
"I love this top! i ordered it in a medium, and it's perfect. i'm 47 years old, 5'2"", 125 lbs, for reference. the detail on this top is beautiful. can be paired with so many things. love it!!!",5
This is so adorable and flattering. dress it up or down with a denim jacket weekday to weekend.w/flats or pumps. love this cute dress. not all wool so it's not itchy at all. the colors are vibrant and would compliment any complexion!,5
I am so glad i ended up with these pants. wasn't ready to pay full price but ordered them immediately on sale & realized they were definitely worth every penny of full price. they are so soft & have so much detail. these pants are just gorgeous. i'm 32 and can't wait to wear these to cabo!! they may run a little large.,5
"This top is very pretty, i ordered both xs p and xxs p not knowing (someone wrote the word boxy in the review) - i tried on the xxs p first, and that was fine. did the trick to not look too boxy. teh fabric is stretchy, and soft/comfortable, not scratchy lace. the lining is soft as well. color is ivory and the embroidery is nice and fiery colors. the sleeves are fairly flattering, even on bigger arms. arm hole was just right too, never know with fluttery sleeves. 
for reference i am 115 lbs, 30",5
"I read the other reviews and from the picture it looked as though it may be a little short, so i ordered up to a large. the medium would have fit, but since i'm in my mid-40's i felt more comfortable with large. but if you are trim and young or young at heart your usual medium will be fine. live the material and the navy makes it classy and rich looking. can be dressed up or down. have worn it to a cocktail party fundraiser with blue crop pants and received many compliments. i'm always challenge",5
"This blouse is stunning. it's ultra feminine but has a bit of bohemian feel to it. i am 5'3"" and 108 pounds. i ordered an xs at first in both colors but they were a little big in the bust area and under the arms. my bust size is 32c. i ordered the xxs in both sizes (not petite, as i have a longer torso) and they fit perfectly! they are not too snug anywhere and it makes the blouse look even better - obviously - because it fits better. the hem of the shirt in a size xxs hits right below the hip b",5
"I saw this in the store and immediately had to try it on. it fits perfectly. i'm usually a size 4/6 with dresses and the small fit perfectly. it looks expensive and high quality and the print is unique. what i love most about it is that i can wear it in the winter time, layered over say.... a black turtle neck and black tights... but i think it can also be worn in the spring, especially with that flower print.",5
"Adorable peasant fitting top.  not too voluminous, just right for over jeans, and really cute with shorts.  the detail makes it wearable for dress up or down, and the cut is classic!",5
I love this blouse. i wasn't sure if i was going to like the high neck but it fits the style. the quality is excellent. i bought a size small and i wear a size 2-4 or xs-s in retailer most of the time. i could have worn the xs if i was a little smaller busted (34c). i'm 5'9 and i didn't like where the gathering hit with the xs. very flowy without looking like a maternity top. it's also lightly lined so i don't have to wear a cami. warning - this shirt is long. if you are on the short side you may,5
"I passed over this dress online thinking i'd never wear it. but, then i found myself inside an retailer store and decided to try it on. i am excited to say that i love this dress. it is soft and lovely. the cowl is large and the whole dress has a really great drape. my favorite thing is that the buttons along the back are functional. opening up the back turns this dress into a long cardigan that is to die for.",5
This top would have been better if it had a stretchy  fabric. being large breasted makes this top a little tight. still so pretty so i'm keeping it. makes me look a little less chesty.,5
"I absolutely love this top. i managed to snag one that had been returned to a store, so i didn't have to order it. i love the cute and the overall boho feel to it. i feel like it's true to size, as i'm normally a medium in retailer.",5
"I was in love with this top from the moment i put it on. it is of high quality, with layers to ensure the top isn't sheer. the embroidery is so pretty and the top looks way less grandma in person. i ordered the petite xxs and it fits perfectly. i really appreciate that the underarm holes are just the right size and don't show off any of my bra, which sometimes happens with sleeveless tops. i can wear it with jeans and boots or with a pencil skirt and heels and it looks great with both outfits. o",5
"Great top! i'm 5'7"", 135lbs and normally wear either an xs or s. i ordered the white to start with and decided to go back for the other 2 colors. it's a great basic to wear with pants/shorts/skirts, but the side slit and slant set it apart from a regular tank. i opted for the small in this top just because of where the side slit hit.",5
This is an adorable dress. medium weight. i highly recommend.,5
"Great arm coverage, soft material, flattering fit. wear with favorite worn-in jeans with holes in the knees and also with white jeans and long or short shorts. i really should purchase another color for summer work staple.",5
"Such a lovely, well constructed top. looks great on petite frames. free flowing but not too ""peasant-like."" the embroidery is gorgeous. while it is pricey, it is something you will wear for years as it is a timeless piece.",5
Lovely statement shift. sweet and sophisticated at the same time. the lightweight knit drapes nicely over one's figure. my store showed it paired with a collared cream-white blouse for alternative styling. i know i'll be experimenting with solid tees.,5
"This is a pretty dress. like the positive reviews have noted.
very figure flattering",5
I haven't worn it yet. i tried it on when i got it and like it alot,5
"I love this sweater dress! i was hesitant to order it after reading some of the reviews, but fear not, friends--this is a comfortable, flattering, warm dress with a unique twist. i love the cowl and the buttons down the back. the knit is fairly large so there's some give to it, which means pulling it on is a breeze, and the buttons don't slip out of their closures unexpectedly, which is an added bonus. i ordered both grey and navy. i stand at 5'6"" and would describe myself as pear-shaped, typica",5
This dress is super bulky and unflattering. the knit is loose and see-through. looks like it was knitted by a five-year old. if you need a dress that adds twenty pounds then this is for you. back to the store it goes,1
"I bought this in red in xs (5'5 115lbs). it's really cute and flirty, but not in a little girl way, which some ruffle tops can look. the material is nice. a little over priced, but isn't everything from retailer?! the red is a perfect red imo, it's got an orange-y undertone to it, looks so good with white jeans and black sandals. if you're inbetween sizes, i would size down but otherwise pretty true to size. i wear everything in xs from retailer and the xs fits perfect.",5
The rocket by citizens of humanity are my favorite jeans. perfect high rise and still makes the butt look good. they are incredibly comfortable. no more hiking up your jeans and bending over. love these so much. am very happy that j brand and citizens are making some good high rises now. won't buy anything else.,5
This dress is so cozy and soft. love it! the cowl is big in a flattering way. absolutely adore the buttons that run down the back of the dress. such an unexpected detail which makes retailer pieces so special. i would layer tights and tank underneath anyway so the see through aspect other reviewers mentioned wasn't apparent to me and also wasn't as big a deal.,5
"I was very impressed with the fit of this sweater dress. i am a 4p, 5'4"" and the length and general fit of this is perfect. the fabric is so soft. love it!!",5
"I own quite a few pieces from retailerplogie but this one is my favorite by far! the color is a crispy white. the length is just right and has a beautiful flow to it. it is more fitted on top but flares out for a feminine appeal. i am 5' 1"", 115 lbs. i bought the regular xs and it fit like a nice tunic top. perfect for a curvy figure- i wore it with my tight jeans and boots. got compliments from everyone!",5
"Saw this online, but it said the store was out of stock. imagine my surprise when i went to my local store and found it in both a small and a medium in white.. i tried them both on, but not a lot of difference in the sizing. the small had a smaller head/neck opening causing it to be a bit tough to remove without getting makeup on it, which the small did. the medium fit very very close to the small, but a smidge bigger at the neck. the shoulders of both seemed to fit the same, with maybe a tad mo",5
"Was in dire need of black high rise skinny jeans. bought these in a moment of ""treat yo' self"" mentality. absolutely do not regret it. at 5'7"", 27-28 waist, typically a 28 in denim - i got the 27s as i found that they not only fit in the waist, but were more slimming. black ""denim"" typically stretches out in jeans as they are not of the same fabric - these have a great weight, perfect ratio of thickness:stretch, look incredibly sleek paired with anything. high rise keeps my belly in check, and a",5
"I bought the white version of this beautiful top in the store yesterday, this romantic top is beautifully detailed, very soft, comfortable and flattering. there is a thin cotton liner underneath too. fits true to size with enough room in the bust to not be too tight.",5
Colors are much more vibrant in person. love this skirt. true to size. makes a statement and is still classy.,5
"Love this blouse. the owl design is flawless front to back. the material has a silk like feeling. i would say the arms a slightly tighter than i would prefer. if you have larger arms or have any muscle the sleeves may be tight on you. also, i am a 38 c and the chest fit well (in size large), but would not offer much more room for a larger chest. if you want a looser and relaxed fit as the model shows, i would size up. i love the unique design!",5
"Such a lovely shirt and even though it is white, flowing and delicate it is not see-through so you will not have to worry about wearing an undershirt in the summer sun. lovely top!",5
"This is really one of those items that hits it out of the park. first, the fit is great. it's relaxed without being oversized or tapering way out or way in or something odd like that. it's nearly universally flattering to most body types and it's easy to wear with nearly anything. shorts, jeans, trousers, pencil skirts.....it looks great dressed up or down. 

i also like that the pleats that create the ruffle are sewn nicely (sometimes my recent purchases from retailer have not been the best qua",5
"This top is everything it promises to be. i read other reviews and purchased a small (i'm typically between an x-small/small depending on the day of the week) and was glad i did. a medium would definitely have been too big but the small fit perfectly. i have a shorter torso (5'3""/117 pounds) so i didn't experience any apprehension about my stomach showing. i paired it with a pair of skinny black ankle pants and a pair of navy and grey d'orsay heels. it worked wonderful and i can't wait to pair i",5
"Love these sateen jeans. they are a bit more polished than regular, flat black jeans, but not too shiny. i am 5'9"" and always wear a 27 in ag jeans and these were consistent with my usual size and fit perfectly. the mid-rise is very comfortable and the length on me is about the same as on the model (hits above my ankles). they're easy to dress up or down, and i have a feeling i'll be getting a lot of use out of them.",5
"If you are in between sizes order smaller size. adorable dress. boots or booties look adorable with it. denim jacket or dress it up. can go either way!  colors are beautiful. i ordered the small and medium and kept the small. i did have it shortened. for reference, i am 5'4. 120 pounds.",5
I just received this blouse and love it...more beautiful in person..i got the black one in a petite and it is perfect...if you want it longer in the front order a regular.,5
"I love, love, love this skirt. it's comfortable and attention getting. i receive compliments whenever i wear it -- and i feel great wearing it. colors are much more vivid than on the website -- that's a plus!",5
I absolutely love this sweater. it is a great quality sweater dress and a beautiful color. so comfy and warm too. i never want to take it off. definitely one of my favorite purchases from retailer.,5
"If you are like i am and love coats that stand out......this is for you. there are many +++++++++'s first being the quality, embellishment like this coat has can easily go crafty and this coat does not, also the bead work and trim is sewn beautifully with no loose threads visible to me. it is hard to see the bead work but it pops just right, colors are wonderful and fit is tts. it also,looks great belted and much nicer in person.....",5
"This dress immediately caught my eye in the store. the colors are vibrant and the cut is flattering. i wear a smaill and it fit perfectly, the sweater material is not thick so it can be worn all year. it is very versatile.",5
"I love this dress?sophisticated and amazing?fabulous fabric. however, if you are petite and take a 0, it will be enormous! i am trying to decide if i send it back or have it altered.",5
"Love this top! wore with jeans, comes to about mid hip so good coverage. fit was perfect for me!",5
"This top is really pretty, however i found it to be super small. i know meadow rue tends to run small, but this small was like an extra small. i'm not large chested either . if you are super straight/thin with a long torso this is the top for you.",5
"I got this in black and have no issue wearing a solid black bra under it. i felt it ran a little big. i'm a 34dd and usually have to wear a medium due to the ""girls"" but a small fit me and fit well. i didn't find it boxy and it fit me perfectly in the shoulders. i paid full price but i loved it so much i didn't mind. the sale price is amazing!",5
"Really cute dress for work. fits exactly as i expected. this dress is very comfortable and looks put together on days when you're being lazy and just want to ""throw something on"".",5
"My heart's a-flutter for this top. the fabric has an excellent weight and feel to it, and the little, fluttery cap sleeves are to die for. i've ordered this in almost every color because it is such a great staple. it is a gorgeous pairing with the marala knit skirt (especially in green,) and the double stripe jacquard skirt, but i'm certain it would be a perfect choice for any pencil skirt. it's so flattering and comfortable, with a neckline that is perfect for single strand pearls or similar le",5
"Fits like a dream: not too tight, not too loose. arm holes aren't too big (a common problem for me in sleeveless retailer tops/dresses), the sweater material isn't itchy, and the pattern is unusual and eye-catching. i felt confident in this dress and received many compliments. great addition to the spring wardrobe.",5
"In contrast to the other reviewer, i love this dress. worth the sale price at least.",5
"These are great, but unfortunately ran small for me in comparison to my other pilcro jeans. i returned and the size i need is sold out now.",5
"This is a nice sweater. very soft and while cardigans are not normally flattering on me, i found this one to be slimming. for reference i am 170 lbs 5'8"" and a size medium or 10.",5
An awful dress! retailer why didn't you post my last review. i would not even give it a quarter of a star.,1
I can't tell you how many compliments i get on this gorgeous sweater/poncho! there are tiny glimmery threads woven into it that make it so fun for dressing up. i wore it to a fall holiday party and it was perfect! it's a little on the itchy side... but the shirt i wore underneath solved the problem. the colors are so gorgeous... deep and rich. love this piece!,5
I loved this t-shirt. i got the grey one in small. i'm a size 2 and 5'3. it is a relaxed fit. i love it because it is a bit different and the flowers add a nice flair. i didn't want t plan t shirt but i also didn't want anything too crazy. fits well and is soft too.,5
"This is a very nice quality t-shirt. i loved the material & colors. i got it on sale and the only reason i had to return it because it was small on me. due to the nice sale, another size was not available.",5
"When i saw this shirt, i knew i had to have it! i got the white with yellow flowers, and the pattern is perfectly charming. i'm 5'2"" and petite with a short torso. the petite xs fit me perfectly! the material is pretty thin, so i hope it stays in good shape. until then, i can't wait to dress this up for work and dress it down for casual summer days.",5
"I love flowers! i love flowers on my basic tees even better! simple,comfy,but different from your every day plain old tee!",5
"Just got both today, skirt and top, and i love how soft the material is. and btw, i learned a valuable lesson from past moth sweater purchases, dry clean; even though the ""how to care for"" tag states hand-washing, d.r.y. clean. the last moth sweater i washed was not in the same shape it was when i first purchased, but i never made that mistake again ;) and it was one of my faves!

i bought this particular top in the large as i wanted the ""boyfriend"" oversized look, and i love the way it drapes o",5
Love the color and the design. it is slightly see-through which i don't like but it still works wotb a nude bra. very comfortable!,5
"I didn't like the price tag, but got a good price with a sale, so i splurged! this skirt hugs curves in the nicest, most flattering way without feeling like you have to hold in your belly:) very cute ruched design and soft make it easily dressed up or down. i plan to wear with some bright flats for an upcoming trip, but have the perfect white tennies for casual everyday. love it!!",5
I love the cut and fit of this t. it's soft and has just enough flow to be comfortable without being unflattering. the gray floral print is very pretty. it's perfect with jeans or shorts in the summer.,5
"This is casual and comfortable.
along with soft touch of its textile, i also like the pastel color of flower prints. 
especially, i love the purple flower print with grey background (which is sold out already).
it also fits well with my body and makes look cool. 

it is perfect for everyday use.",5
"This color came out after i had purchased the same in the gray motif. when i saw this one, though, i simply had to have it! it is such a happy print and different color scheme from anything else in my closet. i had purchased the gray one in regular only because the petites were all sold out, but i was able to get this one in my usual small petite size. it is most definitely a better fit/length for me. i don't usually like to pay so much for a t-shirt, but i will splurge for something like this t",5
"I love this t-shirt, i wish it came in tons of other prints! very soft, almost feels lived in, and high quality all the same.",5
"I have a closet filled with black lace dresses but this one is my new favorite!
the style is classic with an unexpected yet still elegant twist.
i ordered my usual size and found it to run a little on the small side, especially in the waist.
this is one dress you need to have in your closet.
if you are in between sizes i would suggest going up one size.",5
"Tshirt is beautiful. looks like watercolor. the fabric is a thin soft cotton that is really nice. i am 5'6"" and very thin. xs fit well and was not too short. s would have been fine too. i would choose a size by your shoulder width. i bought my mother the medium.",5
"These shorts were just what i expected from retailer. they are more pretty in person, particularly for the color - like a rich clay color, not garish orange. very good quality fabric & the embroidery around the edges is unique. i'm usually a size small in bottoms from retailer & the s fits perfectly.",5
Very soft! i sized up. was able to wear without a cami underneath,5
I tried on about 25 items in the store today and didn't buy anything but if i had bought just one thing it would have been this great floral t-shirt (i may have to go back for it). the combination of the very soft material and faded look of the pattern gives it the look and feel of an old favorite tee shirt. the fit is exceptional as well- not too loose or too snug. i would definitely snap it up on sale and may even have to cave to the full price.,5
"Love this shirt! i love florals so the bright pretty yellow just had to be mine. it is true to size, perfect neckline- not too low or high and very flattering. see through enough to require a cami, but worth it. very soft fabric and really comfy.",5
"I got the xs and it fits perfectly, almost an a line cute slightly fuller on the bottom, not too form fitting and not too loose. i am 5'1"" and the length is not short as it appears in the photo on the model. the yellow flower pattern is super cute. material is soft and comfy.",5
"This tee is so soft and comfy. it looks nicer than a regular tee but still casual. fits true to size, and not too loose, but not too clingy. i know i'll wear this one a lot!",5
"I loved this t-shirt in the gray motif so much, went back to get the yellow:-) both go great with pilcro hyphen chinos. while the fabric is a little thin, it's super soft and just the perfect length.",5
I ordered the yellow. i love this shirt it such a happy print. can match a lot of things.,5
"I don't know why i didn't pay much attention to this tee (the yellow), but i didn't. i saw it in the store, thought it was interesting and kept on going. then i really looked at it online and suddenly i had a bad case of the wants. so when i was in one of my local stores i asked about it, and no surprise, it was sold out. at the suggestion of my sales associate i tried on a solid one just for the size. although i'm small, i have several tla tees in medium, so i tried on a medium and a small. as",5
Such a great purchase! it can be dressed up or down and seems to go with everything! great for summer!,5
Nice print and comfortable shirt.,5
"Seems like all i wear all summer are solid colored tees with shorts or skirts. decided this summer i would have patterns! and color! this is a great t-shirt. nice weight. pretty pattern. i found the length on the small to fit my frame perfectly. an xs probably would be good too, but i hate having my favorite t-shirts shrink to unwearable so i always start a little bigger.",5
"I bought the grey version of this shirt in-store because of the cute pattern, soft material, and versatility of wear; you can dress it up for work or wear with jeans/shorts for a more casual look. the beautiful purples, greens, and blues of the roses look like a water color painting, and stand out against the grey background. i've already received multiple complements from co-workers and friends, and liked it so much myself i bought the other two colors! personally i think it runs a bit large, s",5
"Love the fit, feel and colors of this tee. looks great with white jeans, blue jeans and is so springy. longer in length than most tees which is a plus for me. may run a tad small since i am usually an xs in most tops but i bought a s and love the fit.",5
"The sweater and skirt are so pretty! they're really soft and have such an easy, comfortable look together. really love this gorgeous outfit.

i am borderline small/medium and kept the size small after trying both on.",5
"So soft and comfortable and flattering on! run small. i'm a 25/0 pant and a small in these is as small as i'd want to go! otherwise, excellent.",5
7 months pregnant with twins and i prefer to buy regular clothes that can be worn post pregnancy as well as when pregnant. went to a dr. apt and the receptionist loved this shirt. i told her it was non-maternity and she can buy it at retailer... i think she stopped by on her way home from work.,5
Great transition into fall. super soft and comfy. great yellow without being too yellow love it.,5
"I bought yellow one, and i'm very happy with this purchase. the flower print is beautiful, and the material is light, but not too thin. i love wearing this top with a pair of blue denim or a pair of white bottom.
i'm pretty short in height and size 36c. i bought a m in regular size because i like my tops roomy, and it fits really nice, i just tie a small knot on the bottom of this top or tuck the shirt in a little bit, it works perfect.",5
"This shirt is so comfortable and soft. it has a great fit. it is a little thin, but i can get away with wearing it by itself. i love it!",5
"I love this tee!!! i bought the red, and it is just so cute. the background is a light pink - and there are accents of deeper rose and mint green. i also bought the angel of the north cascade cardigan in rose, which looks great over this tee. buy it!",5
"I purchased this towards the end of winter because it reminded me of spring time! it is such a lovely soft tee, with a delicate flower design. i wear it with jeans. it always makes me feel happy.",5
"Great fabric, great fit, great shirt. just found my new favorite for this summer!!",5
These shorts are wonderful! very stylish and easy to pair with my tops. they do run a bit large. i am normally a size 8 or 29. i ordered these in a medium and i definitely could have gone with small. they are machine washable though and i'm not sure if they will shrink at all so i'm keeping them. i would definitely recommend them.,5
I debated forever about ordering this and so glad i did! the colors are so pretty. i got the yellow and it's slightly sheer but ok w/ a nude bra. regarding fit- completely tts imo. i'm a 8/10 and 38 c and the med is perfect. i am so happy i did not size up.,5
"I got this piece because it was so unique.. that's one of the things i love so much about retailer: not afraid to go where no woman has gone before, so i ordered it in a 4p, my usual size, and a 4. i am petite, but the 4 worked perfectly, i think. i am pretty voluptuous below the waist and medium to small on the top and the 4p was too small all over - so i would agree that it runs small.

the quality is excellent, the look is great. my husband liked it on me. it might work for the office with so",5
"I bought this at the store and when i picked it up i didn't think much of it until i tried it on! it is so adorable, i can't even tell you how much... i am 48 yo and normaly buy xs/s or 2/4 in retailer. mauve dresses are 2 most of the time. small chest, 5'5"" and about 130lbs and i got the size 4 and it is perfect! i hope it is age appropriate tho... ;) i have traveling plans this summer and i am thinking this could be an easy thing to take along with me, one piece clothing that will travel very we",5
I absolutely love this sweater. it is a beautiful deep blue color. i love the unique cuff on the sleeves.. i feel it does run a bit big but once you pull the strings it shortens up dramatically. looking forward to late summer and early fall so i can wear it!,5
"I bought this online days before my trip to seattle. i read the reviews so was aware it runs large...and it does. i practically lived in it the whole time i was there. it's very comfortable and once it cools down here in so cal i'll be back in it. some reviewers mentioned it bunched up when tied but didn't like the ties hanging loose. i just looped each one and it works great. 
it really runs large. i bought their smallest size and had ample room.",5
"I tried this one without a bra, and t was fine... a little droopy but i could go without.
the things that bothered me: the pattern wasn't even on both sides, so where the seem is on the legs by the wait, didn't match... some people may not be annoyed by that, but hard for me not to look at.
also, the length on the model is just below the knee. i usually order petite, but tried on regular size in the store... i liked it like that, the hem went to below the big part of my calf, so it 3was flatte",5
"I was immediately drawn to this tunic at the store. it has my favorite colors in it. blue and orange. as one reviewer said, the print is eye-catching. the feel of the material is soft. i am 5' tall so it fits on me like a dress, although if you are a taller person, the slits on the side may be higher on the frame. this is definitely one of my favorite tunics now.",5
"I bought this awesome jumpsuit and i love it ! i really don't like wearing one piece clothing but this one its just so comfy and it looks great, i wear it with the straps or strapless and it looks different, as you can wear it classy or casual. and the best park, it has side pockets ! the color is as the description, navy blue and ivory/cream pattern. i wear a size 2. and that's what i got when i bought this, so pretty much to size for my  liking.",5
Make sure to get the whole outfit. the skirt sits high enough so that it avoids the muffin look.,5
I love this sweater! i tried it on at the store and had to purchase! it's even cuter on! i am normally between a small and a medium but decided on the small as it has a loose look. perfect weight for summer!,5
"I absolutely love this dress. beautiful, flattering shape with flowing light weight fabric. i'm so in love with this color. a great dress for a special night.",5
"I just received this. it is adorable! well made with attention to detail. the cotton is soft and it hugs the body well in the right places. the pattern is actually sewn into the cotton. very cool. it has a sophisticated, elegant and urban vibe to it. this one is a winner.",5
"So glad i gave this a try. looks so much better on than seeing it online!!! i doubt i will ever wear it tied, but it's very cute and comfortable. it will probably be my go-to sweater to throw on over summer clothes when the ac is too cold. it would even be great to throw on over workout clothes! 
fits tts.",5
"I love this soft, glistening, flowy beauty!  it's my favorite color too!  i'm 5'5"", 34d, size 6 and a small fit me with room to spare.  don't wait!",5
"Ahh it's delightful! it's a little short in the fit, but it's so cute. and didn't cost an absurd amount like some more heavy weight or full trench coats. love it.",5
"Love ag jeans!! a little on the pricey side...but so worth it. the harper style is just enough higher wasted so i can actually bend over and not worry about anyone seeing anything other than my jeans :) but not too high waisted. these jeans keep their shape still with a little strestch to them. i am 5'5,, and 111 lbs and if not wearing under boots would have to a0 alter or b) wear as these are in the picture because they'd be too long for me. but i would purchase these all over again. love these",5
"They have some stretch, so if you are between sizes, order down. they are very long, which for me is a good thing!",5
Love love these jeans. they are just the right rise and the straight leg is perfect. the color of the demin is great to wear to work. the fit is great.,5
I wear a 10/12. i bought a 30/31 and they fit perfect in every way! they were even almost too long so i can wear with heels if i want. i am so glad i bought these. don't let the folded cuff in the picture deceive you. a great pair of straight leg jeans!,5
"The model doesn't do this jumpsuit justice. absolutely gorgeous!  beautifully constructed,  cute details,  flows well,  easy to dress up or down...
5'5"" 135 34 c- the 6 was perfect.",5
"The fabric and design of this piece are so unique.  i am skeptical of wide leg designs in product photos because the fabric is often much more voluminous irl than it appears, which is the case for this jumpsuit.  despite the extra volume, the fabric weight gives it a structured look which makes the wide legs look fantastic on.  there is a silicon grip band around the top that allows you to wear it strapless, though it doesn't seem very functional to me without boning or more structure to the sid",5
"Love these jeans! fit great and can be causal or dressy! what i appreciate is that you can wear them with flats, boots and heels so worth the cash!",5
The quality of the fabric and the design are perfect. i love the cut out and how flattering on my shorter figure. i am somewhere between a 6 and 8 and the 6 fit perfectly. it can also be strapless which is a sexier version.,5
"This jacket is perfect and drapes very well. i had my eye on it online and the second i put it on, it was a ""yes"". if you are between sizes, as one reviewer mentioned, size down. it's tts but has a little extra room for me on the 2, so i sized down to 0. 5'4"" 115lbs.",5
This is my first pair of ag and i love them so far. they are not cuffed as shown in the picture. they are long so i had to get them altered (i'm 5''5). the color is a rich blue and they have a nice stretch. i haven't worn them all day yet to see if they keep their shape. usually a 28 or 29 and went with the 28 on these. got them on 20 perc off sale so very happy!,5
I love these pants! so comfortable and can be dressed up and dressed down! love them!,5
"I'm calling this the ""gateway jumpsuit"" for all those ladies who are wondering about this whole jumpsuit trend and how they feel about it--you know who you are. this jumper is flattering, comfortable, elevated--and worth trying on! i'm petite but long-waisted with curves on the bottom, which can be a tough combo when trying to find a jumper. i actually ordered the petite 2 first, which was better fitting in the waist area but i ended up ultimately purchasing the regular 2 since i preferred where",5
"Love these jeans. comfortable fit, doesn't stretch out too much after wearing a few hours. goes with dress up, lazy day or casual tops. my go-to jeans. wish they came in different washes",5
I'm 5' 120 lbs. i'm posting a photo. one lady was concerned about it being ok for the over 40 crowd. i wore it was a cami under. see pic. it is comfy. it has pockets and fits beautifully. i ordered a 6petite. it's a little long on me. buy i still like it and am enjoying wearing it.,5
Beautiful detail. fits likes a glove. i have a short torso and design hits perfectly on my waist. may not be good for those with longer torsos. very flattering . arm holes well fitted. no open gaps. i plan to wear this to a november wedding.,5
"After trying several one piece options i decided to buy this gorgeous tankini. i love the fit - bottoms stay put while running around the beach with my girls, but still stylish. the top is a perfect fit- little lining and halter adjustable tie is flattering on a smaller chest. the material is high quality and i will be living in this all summer long. there is about a two inch gap between the top and bottom.",5
"I've been looking for a black off-the-shoulder dress and found this baby in store today. for reference, i am 5'8"", 34b, 140-150 and took a small. this dress is a shift/swing style, so if you're looking for something fitted this isn't your dress. as another reviewer mentioned, ladies who are busty may not like this as the ruffle at the top could add unwanted volume. if you are extremely thin or petite, i might size down, but i like my clothing loose vs. fitted so i kept the small. the fabric is g",5
"These shorts are super soft and comfortable. i am normally a size 27 or a 2 in shorts. i got a size 26 in these shorts and they are still large. i exchanged them for a 25 and they fit perfectly. so these run 1-2 sizes large. other than sizing, these shorts are perfectly comfortable and functional.",5
"The material is so soft, and lightweight without being sheer. i am 5'1 #145 and ordered a size 28 in blue. they have a relaxed fit, and a polished-casual look.",5
"Got these on sale...absolutely love eberjey! fabric is super soft and easy to wash. more ""normal"" than other eberjey styles (not lingerie). i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs and small fit well. i am small busted and there is definitely extra room but doesn't make it fit weird at all. highly recommend!",5
"Super soft shorts. i ordered them in the orange and it's a lovely soft orange. they aren't too short, about mid thigh. i found the 27 to be a little loose on the waist but i was afraid to compromise the length for a size 26. i may order the navy in 26.",5
"Not sure why this is considered a top--it's an open front cardigan. also the the maker is monogram/hwr, not knitted & knotted. soft knit, inverted pleat at back yoke, slight flare after the armpits, slightly fitted at shoulders but not restrictive. pretty much looks like the picture! hand stitch elements seem to be the random embroidery sprinkled throughout the sweater. colors are dark blue-black, navy blue, gray, blush, ivory and turquoise. i am 5'3"" 135# 36d 38/28/35 and i purchased size mp.",5
"This twist front top fits true to size, it is perfect! i really love the ruched sides, i like a longer tankini but most of them the stomach area is too wide and flowy. this one is perfect, it hugs your sides and looks great to wear with my kids but still flirty with my husband! i got the navy top and the side tie bottoms in navy/periwinkle and they are so cute together, can't wait to hit the beach!!",5
"Yes these are a true clear red. not neon red or orange red, but a classic shade of red. these pants are so comfortable with just the right amount of stretch. they are a nice weight for spring/summer without being too light or flimsy. they remind me of j crew martie but i like these better. i'd say they fit tts if not slightly on the large side. for reference my waist is 26 and hips are 35. the size 0 fits very well but the 2p were too big. ( i also take a 0 in the martie but those are slightly m",5
Sweater fits great and is nice and soft. i am 5'11 and got a m and the arms and length are perfect for me,5
Bought this is black and white... love them but washed the white by hand and it shrunk...,5
"I bought this online to wear in my engagement photos, and its absolutely perfect! i typically wear a size l or xl and could have easily worn the l in this top, runs a tad big. keep in mind it is on the shorter side. i will be purchasing a white tank to wear underneath it.",5
"This dress is lovely - the soft material is prettier in person and the fit is perfect for me. i found it tts, wearing my normal s. i'm 5'8.5"" and it hits me a little lower towards my ankles than pictured, but doesn't the floor. it will be perfect for an upcoming wedding rehearsal lunch and a go to summer dress after that!",5
Love this top. i ordered the pink and it was more of a dusty rose. it also runs large - i normally wear a medium top. i am going to exchange it for white in small.,5
Fun top for day or evening.,5
"Loved the one i had in white so much i ordered the green - such a beautiful piece! size seems true to size, and it elevates anything you wear it with; skirt, jeans, shorts....if you are on the fence, jump- you won't be disappointed.",5
"The material of the lace is nice and soft, it is not a stiff lace. i am 5'6"" 36dd 146lbs and ordered the small. it fits perfect not tight through bust or the arm holes. i wore today for the first time and everyone that sees the top loves it as much as i do. i ordered the white and in the pictures it looks like a bright white, it is not. it is more of an antique white and i am wearing a nude colored camisole and it works perfect. i think it will be really cute with a colored cami also. this will",5
"If you've been searching for red crops, gotta give these a try!! i bought my normal size 6 and they fit perfectly! they're a little more snug on me in the butt and thigh than on the model, but they're super flattering and the color is wonderful!! fabric is a tad thin, really stretchy (in a good way), and the weight is great for summer. i haven't worn them yet, so i'm not sure if they'll keep they're shape. fingers crossed!",5
"I am a true size 6 in virtually everything, pants or dress. i was swimming in these! i am reordering a size 2, they were so big.",5
I ordered this sweater online in a size xs and the order was cancelled because it was out of stock. i ended up finding a sm at my local retailer and was so happy! it worked just perfectly. i'm usually an xs but the sm worked great. it is a thick knit and may snag so i'm being careful with it. simply meant to be:),5
I got the off-white lace top and love it! quality is great for the price. comfortable and the lace isn't super delicate so it seems like it should last.,5
"What a cute top! it's a little on the short side for me (5'7"") but i'm keeping it because it is so pretty. the lace is lightweight and delicate but seems like it will hold up pretty well. trying to decide what to wear under it, but i think it could look cute with a cami for work, or even a cute bra that has some coverage for super casual days. the lace is completely sheer but doesn't feel as revealing as i would expect. would be super cute over a swim top with jean shorts and sandals...wish i li",5
"These pants are gorgeous--the fabric has a satiny stretch that simply feels decadent on. i tried on the size 0 and 2 and though they both fit, the size 2 was more flattering (i'm 5' 8"" 120lbs). compared to cartonnier's capris (which i love and wear a size 4 in), the fabric and construction on these is superior. and the color is knockout red.",5
Perfect high rise jeans - just a little bit of stretch for comfort. the high waist doesn't roll down and no knicker cleavage when bending over. perfect to go with crop tops,5
"Love this top, the lace detailing on it is gorgeous and fits tts. however, the length does run a bit short, not crop top short, but it is shorter than i expected, and i'm s short person.the color is listed as white and as pictured, it also looks white, but it's not. it's definitely an ivory color. i bought a white camisole to wear under it and when the top arrived, the tank didn't match the top.",5
"The picture says it all. fits tts. love it, love it, love it!",5
Love these pants. the color is a true red and they are very flattering on. i ordered the 6 but they are a little big and i think the pant will give a little when wearing. just reordered the size 4.,5
The perfect summer top. paired with a small tank underneath and jeans and had many compliments!,5
"I loved this top . it is exactly what i wanted,",5
"Love this top! the lace pattern is gorgeous, and the detail at the neck and sleeves make it a little more casual. it's completely sheer, so you do need a white tank or shell underneath. the top is on the shorter side, but definitely not a crop. i'm 34c and 140b and got a small. fits great and pairs well with black pants and heeled booties.",5
Fits perfect!! tank top or bath top. swings nicely and not too tight on top. i ordered large and am a 38 d. sits perfect not long not short!,5
This will be a frequently worn item. print is beautiful and the fit is comfy and classy.,5
"I'm an xl in retailer tops, and to be frank sometimes some of the xl are too fitted and i return them. i bought this blouse in size large and it fits loose everywhere. it drapes very nicely in the front and back, and the arms fit loose. i'm making a point to say this to let people know to size down. 
-
i was concerned this blouse might be too short because it looks very short on the model, but for me it hits at a nice length; i have a short waist and am busty. the lace doesn't hit my neck",5
This dress attracted my attention with its victorian inspired print. the details are to die for. the blue is not the same as the picture. slightly darker and more muted.,5
"I tried this top on in the store and didn't buy it because i was in a hurry. obsessed about it and it was sold out when i went back. so happy i was able to get it online, it's beautiful. i got a medium and it fits perfectly, enough room that it hangs nicely but not baggy, i'm typically a medium in shirts at retailer. it looks beautiful with high waisted black pants. i wear a cami underneath. i own it in white and tried it on with a black bra only and it looked great, i just didn't feel comfortable",5
"I can't say enough good things about this sweater. i bought it when it was full-price and it was totally worth it. it is incredibly soft and looks very sophisticated. i wish i could live in this sweater--given the color and my propensity to make a mess, i want to buy two more just in case!",5
"I was already purchasing another mock neck in a similar color when i came upon this sweater. it is everything a snuggly sweater should be. it is long in the torso with long sleeves that really do cover your hands, like in the picture online. if you like that sort of thing, this is a great sweater. the sweater even has pockets, which may be a little odd, but on this sweater it works. i bought this to wear with a pair of sanctuary flowered leggings. it is the perfect outfit!",5
"Love this top and will be wearing it for our fall family pics this weekend! it is lovely, soft and flattering.",5
"I purchased this on sale. it exceeded my expectations. it is extremely soft and had a very unique construction and details. i love it. it does shed a bit, but that does not bother me as the sweater is stunning! ordered my typical size small. no camisole is needed if worn with a nude bra.",5
"Soft and cozy, not itchy at all, and it has pockets! i am 5'3, 120lbs, 34dd bra and take this in size small.",5
"I love this dress.....but, and it saddened me that there was a but; the material would wrinkle near the sleeves (fit issue) and the high neckline was a little uncomfortable. i ended up returning it, because at this price point, i need perfection. i would definitely recommend this dress, it just wasn't for me.",5
"The lace on this looks like it would be stiff, but it isn't. it's soft and drapes nicely. i normally buy an xl (if it's not a knit) and so i did. the top will fit up to a size 18 in the xl because it is boxy and generous. it fit me perfectly and just tapered my body. it looks looser in the photo.

it's as see through as the photo. and, i wouldn't wear a cami under it. that defeats the purpose for hot weather imho. i think a nude bra works just fine. you can see the model is wearing a white bra",5
"Absolutely love this sweater because it is so pretty while being soft and comfortable. i am 5'4"" and purchased the small?it falls a little below my hips. while the color matches everything, the pockets and details add a nice touch and the longer sleeves are cozy. the only drawback is it pills and sheds.",5
Really great tank. fit runs a little small if you are tall.,5
"I wore this dress for an after party the day of my wedding day in new orleans. going to a music lounge!! seriously, i kept getting compliments!!! it's fits beautiful and i just love the different type of patterns!",5
"This simple lace top is beautiful and easy to wear, but do not wash it. the hem completely fell apart for me!",1
"I usually try to buy things on sale but after trying this dress on twice, i didn't want to run the risk of waiting and it selling out. it is extremely flattering and i think it will be very versatile - i'll definitely wear this dress to work, out with friends, and you could also wear it to bridal/baby shower events as well. i bought the dress in blue and it is extremely comfortable. i do think it runs large - i am 5'9, 145lbs with a very straight (no hips) / athletic build (have an athlete butt)",5
"This dress is absolutely stunning. i did agree with other reviewers that the skirt is very full. i had it taken in, and it fits exactly like the model.",5
"I love this dress - the fabric is super soft, and it falls beautifully! wish it was lined, but it's a keeper. it does run big - i'm always a solid medium, and i had to go down to a small for this one (but who's complaining!). the burgundy color is gorgeous! i'm 5'4 150 lbs, a size 8 (m) almost always.",5
This has quickly become my favorite dress. i bought the turquoise dress and the color is so lovely. the fit is perfect and the lines are flattering and classic. this is one of those dresses that will never go out of style.,5
I love this dress! wasn't much on the hanger but fell in love as soon as i put it on. almost returned after reading the reviews about the fabric content and printed design instead of embroidered but tried it on one last time and decided to keep it. the silhouette is just stunning. absolutely stunning. this will be a classic piece in my wardrobe that i pass down to my children one day.,5
I love everything about this dress. the sleeve and bodice detail make this dress exceptional. the fit is true to size. i ordered medium. the length is as it appears on the model- just below the knee. the material is of great quality and the slip lining is made of a nice stretchy knit.,5
"I love this dress! very comfortable fit, and lots of compliments for the color (moss). took me from the classroom to a cocktail party. one of my best retailer purchases.",5
"This is a beautiful, flattering top that looks great on its own or layered under kimonos or jackets. i bought it in wine and black.",5
"I am 5'2"", 120lbs. and bought the 4 petite, which is what i normally wear, and it fits perfectly. the quality of the fabric and stitching is good, not great, and more what i would expect to see in a less expensive garment, but for me, the style, the fit and the fact that it doesn't seem to show wrinkles, at least not before washing, turned it in to a keeper for me. the drawstring ties in the back and i find it a little weird when you wear a belt with it. i tried the ada belt with it, but found i",5
"I waited to review as i ordered both colors and multiple sizes for comparison.

ivory is actually truly longer than the black, i wasn't sure from the photos on line, but having tried both on, ivory is longer (as shown online).

true to size/bigger: i am never sure if i should write true to size or big, but went with the xs petite (used to do everything in xs)... at 115 lbs, 30 dd chest, 26.5 in waist,t ehre was room to move super comfortably. petite for sure for me for both length at the kne",5
"This top is so unbelievably cute! the fit is perfect and it goes with just about anything on the bottom. i personally styled mine with high waisted distressed skinny jeans and it looks adorable. its a tiny bit see-thru, so you do need to wear a tank under it.",5
"This romantic top has lovely embroidery and beading details. i purchased this in purple, which is actually more of a cranberry color. i like that the detail work carries over to the back on the cap sleeves.",5
"This dress not only makes a statement, it is very comfortable and versatile. casual or dressy options! price is reasonable and i am anxious to wear it for the first time. true to size and has some give. i ordered xs. love it!",5
"I bought this dress in the print and the moss color and may very well return for the dark gray. for reference, i am 5'2"", 140 lbs. i have been more recently wearing size 6, but a 4 was perfect, so i do think it runs a bit large. this dress has a drawstring that ties in the back and cinches the waist up nicely, and is very flattering. the waist actually hits at the natural waistline and not up on the ribs. the fabric is lightweight and washes well. i washed and immediately hung dry. it was slight",5
"I'm trying to buy more basic, versatile clothes and this dress in gray is great for that. definitely runs large-- i usually wear an 8 and it fits in a 6p. i'm, 5'5"" and the petite falls where it does on the model. the regular was unflatteringly long and sack-like. quality seems ok for the sale price.",5
"This dress is super soft, beautiful on, perfect fit!",5
"This shirt is just as great in person as it is online.  it's a substantial fabric which is not see-through which seems hard to find these days with whitish tops.  the color is more off-white without looking yellow.  i ordered a small and medium because i was concerned about the length and tightness in sleeves.  they fit almost the same with the only difference being that the upper sleeves on the small were just a tad bit more fitted, but not in a bad way.  i'm 5'5"" and found the length to be jus",5
Great staple item. i have it in multiple colors and like them all. easy to add statement necklace to change up the look. wear it under cardi or jacket to make it not look 'tent' like.,5
"I ordered both the petite and regular in the olive green motif. the regular fit more as i was hoping so i returned the petite.
i am only 5' 4"" but my legs are long for my height. i wasn't ready to have the side slits ""up to here"" and whereas they are not they are still quite high it is modest enough to be worn any place i might wear the dress. i think i will likely wear a belt with it as shown at least part of the time. i just bought some print fabric sling back shoes which go beautifully with",5
"Love this dress! it fits perfectly, is flattering, and the fabric is high quality. i ordered the blue print, and it is a vibrant turquoise. i may order in the charcoal as well, as this is a comfortable, cute dress for everyday casual. i am 5'7, 135 lbs and the size 4 was perfect, even a tad bit loose, but i prefer a bit loose to tight, especially with the design with the buttons up the front.",5
"Bought this back during an retailer event, because i was in the market something long & oversized to wear over leggings. so when i saw this, i thought it could fit the bill. i read the reviews & knew it was more of a soft, t-shirt-like fabric and is short when belted, so, because i'm 5'10, i was sold!
i bought the xl, because i have wide shoulders & a dd chest size. 

when i got it home -- i was in love: rich garnet & so soft & comfy. then i tried buttoning it. it was just a bit too small & pul",5
"I purchased the grey color, and i love love love everything about this dress. the fabric is so soft and feels like pj's. i'm just shy of 5'9"" and the length is perfect for work. i purchased the medium, the fit was perfect for me (size 8, 138 lb).

highly recommended!!",5
This dress is very lovely - ivory fits as pictured (slightly below knee) in ivory not as the black is depicted (much shorter). fits a little larger than expected and material is very stretchy.,5
"Lots of embellishment, striking magenta color, feels great on, with a flattering neckline that isn't too low. i recommend it!",5
"This dress is much better irl than pictured. when i saw it online i thought it looked very frumpy, but i tried it on in store and loved it. it's a perfectly draped shirt dress, and it ties to define the waist. a classic!",5
"This is a very cute dress! the sweater material is not itchy at all. i love the bell sleeve and how the seam at the top of the bell matches up to the waistline of the dress. good quality and well made. i am 5' 9"" tall and this dress falls just above my knees. so for me, it's the perfect length. i bought the black dress and i look forward to wearing it throughout the fall and winter.",5
"I wasn't sure about this dress, and decided to give it a shot based on reviews, could not be happier. before trying it on i was worried about the length, and always worry about dreaded button gap at the chest, but none of that is an issue.",5
"I was nervous about this purchase, but it turned out to be a new favorite. the blue color is stunning on and i can easily see this taking me from work to dinner. i am normally a size 2 or 4 in dresses. after reading reviews about how this dress runs large, i ordered a 2 and hoped i didn't have to return it. the 2 is perfect and roomy. the drawstring can be let out or in for more figure definition. this really is a beautiful and modest dress.",5
"Fits well, soft and comfortable",5
"While i love the fabric and the pattern, this skirt leaves too much to be desired. the full price is absurd considering what you get.
there is no mention online that there is no built in slip, and as the material is extremely thin a slip is an absolute must. (see attached photo.) even in dim lighting you can see straight through. 
also for this price point it is strange that the skirt is 'pull-on styling.' i would say that it is true to size, and i am usually a medium @ retailer, but i have a sm",1
"I loved how soft this dress was, as well as versatile. however, i only got to wear it one time because after the first wash, a giant fabric tear happened on one of the seams. unfortunately, the fabric is so soft, but rather thin, and it didn't hold. the care instructions say machine washable but i wouldn't put it in the washing machine again. especially since i often have to wash clothes twice in the washer i use because it's so old and barely agitates. would love this if it was made a little be",1
"I love this top! looks great with just about any kind of jean (skinny, flare, especially high waisted). even looks good with vests and cardigans. a perfect versatile piece for the fall - you won't regret!",5
This is a cute swing top. tts but generous. best thing about it- the color. i got purple and it is so pretty and saturated. i think it'll look great with big gold hoop earrings. alone or under a cardigan or denim jacket. i'd consider other colors at sale price.,5
"I was pleasantly surprised with this one. fits a bit large. i'm 8-10, the 8 fits just right. the moss is a great staple color.",5
I loved the style when i saw it online and even more in person. the fabric is light but not too light. it has a nice drape i didn't expect. easy to wear and style. the draw string gives it a great shape but a belt is a great addition for more interest. the length is fantastic as well. wonderful midi length but with the side slits.,5
"One of the reasons i avoid skirts at all costs is because i have a bigger tummy and don't like the extra tight feeling i have of a skirt around my waist. i like this skirt because of its stretchiness. even wore it to a bbq where i could eat my heart out and not feel constricted at all.

received many compliments including: ""you look like you're vacating in the caribbean!""",5
"These jeans fit true to size, and they look amazing. i wear a 26 and have an athletic build, and they look great everywhere! i love how they look with sandals.",5
"I find that petite gals with short (,muscular) legs can have a hard time finding cropped pants that fit right. the flare on these makes the pants oh so flattering. the material is nice and thick and holds you in. the colors and patterns are beautiful fall colors, quite lovely and subtle, there is a nice stretch to the pant, the waist has nice closures, can't wait to weer these! i ordered the 0p and htey fit perfectly. (115 lbs, 26.5 in wiast)",5
"This is my first maxi skirt and i am pleasantly surprised! i might not have purchased this had i not tried it on in store, but did for the fun of it and loved the shape and swing of the skirt. the material is a comfortable and substantial stretchy jersey fabric with an inner lining that keeps it from being sheer. though it is kind of a dark navy, i would agree with one of the previous reviewers that it could pass for a black and white pattern. for my sister's graduation, i paired it with a white",5
"I wanted to love this product so badly. i ordered it in the mail, and it looked beautiful coming out of the box. i normally look really nice in grey, but this color really washed me out and was not nice on. the fabric is very sheer, so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top. this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person. large in arms, small on body. odd fit.",1
"This skirt has a great pattern and the stretchy fabric allows it to shape my body perfectly. adorable with a white-t, or a black one...great for a night out on the town and some sexy, strappy sandals! love this skirt!",5
"I love this skirt. i normally wear a medium or large, depending on cut, and i bought this in a medium. very stretchy and forgiving! it's lined so it feels substantial but not too heavy. it's flattering!",5
"I think i own nearly every maeve skirt retailer has sold over the last five years, and this might be my new favorite. one major improvement over years past is the fit...it really is true to size, rather than running large as has been the case in the past. the material is a substantial, stretchy jersey with a nice texture. the weight of the fabric combined with the jersey slip means it's not sheer at all, and it also a nice smooth fit, skimming over less-than-perfect areas. i also really appreciate",5
"Love love love this dress! but, if you are not wearing a slip...you should be! please wear a slip, you can see right through this dress.",5
"I tried on this romper when it was still full price and loved it, but wasn't sure i wanted to splurge at the time. at the new sale price this romper is definitely worth it for the quality and style. i am 5'2''/103lbs and the xs fits pretty well, but truthfully an xxs would have been better if it existed. the top part of the romper (above the waist) is a bit long--- the waistband hits maybe an inch or 2 below my natural waist, but perhaps this can be tailored. overall very happy with this purchas",5
"I couldn't be happier with this skirt! i was expecting a jersey-type material, but was pleasantly surprised by the thicker, textured, higher quality material. the ruffle on the front is such a cute feature. this skirt moves and flows very nicely when walking. it is lined and has an elastic waistband, it's super comfortable. so far i've paired it with a bright red knotted tee and a sheer white sleeveless button-down. i receive compliments every time i wear it! i'm 5'2"", 110 lbs, i ordered an xs a",5
"I haven?t loved the look of something so much in a while as this skirt in the green motif, which i spotted in my durham store. so i ordered it in the xspetite; my usual retailer size (+/- 105 lbs., 34"" hips, 26"" waist, average torso length, short legs). if you have smaller than a 26-inch waist, the waist of the xsp will probably be too big. i?d say this skirt is exactly as pictured. the fabric is a thickish, textured knit on the outside, with a thin, green, very soft jersey lining. you have to be",5
"Me: 5'6"", 130, waist 28/29, hips 36. bought the size 4. i'm expecting a bit of stretch to allow a bit more room for the booty...3% spandex and they seem like standard cartonnier 'charlie' fit.
i love the kicky cropped flare.
they're described as grey motif but everyone in store (and i agree) called them green. the main diamonds are forest green with a grey/green inset and a blue/grey inset inside that. (whew!)
they come with an extra button, keep it as those tiny buttons are going to be first",5
"Love the color pattern, tiny gold buttons, flattering fit, quality of fabric and make.  i got size 4 petite, which fits perfectly. my husband said they looked really good on me and were keepers! i'm 5'2"", 115#.  highly recommend .",5
This skirt fits amazing. i run between a s and m in bottoms and went with the s. there is a little give in the fabric which is always a plus. this will surely become a staple in my wardrobe.,5
I am in love with this skirt! it is the most flattering thing i have purchased in a while. the fabric is a beautiful medium weight knit with a good amount of give. it hugs your curves but doesn't cut in anywhere! i was able to easily go down a size from my usual. i love it so much that i am going to order the other color as well!,5
"I walked into a local retailer store and saw these pants. talk about love at first sight. they have an amazing look and fit! usually, i have to buy petite-sized pants, but the length fit at my ankle, and i like the look better than what is shown. since it is still summer, i paired the pants with a cute white tank and black flip flops, but can't wait to mix it up with a cute bootie and sweater.",5
"I absolutely love the way this skirt looks and fits. i have a smaller waist and larger hips so it is hard to find a pencil skirt that fits, but this skirt fits great! the material has some stretch to it but is still thick and looks really nice. the colors are beautiful, i bought it in the ""red"" which is really just multi-colored. i want it in the green now, too!",5
I wore this skirt immediately when my delivery arrived. nothing but compliments. i went right back to order the green and it has sold out. bummer - i would buy every. single. color. this skirt is that great!,5
"This skirt fits like a glove. i'm 5'6, curvy and it is very flattering on my shape. its a good length and the material has some stretch in it so it's very comfortable.",5
"Again, maeve knocks it out of the park with this skirt! great quality, style and comfort! i love that it's machine washable. so great and versatile for work or a night out! this is not a ""con"" but might be a bit long for short ladies. i'm 5'6"" and it's below the knee.",5
"Saying that these pants are comfortable would be redundant. they are over & above in comfort. i wear a size 8; and they are right on in sizing. i want to comment on the color/print. to see the green, i had to take the pants by a window with natural light and look closely. that being said, i think the pants take on the color of top one chooses. i walked through my closet with the pants in hand. they match with light grey, periwinkle blue, light sky blue, navy, white, your choice. i do prefer a so",5
"My only problem with the skirt was the length - it appears shorter in the pictures, and i can't take it up since it would mess up the front slit. i would have returned for the petite, but it was not available in the green color which i loved. even though the length is longer than i usually wear, i get non-stop compliments on the skirt. and, it's very versatile.",5
"Great skirt! i bought the red and paired it with a casual white button down. i feel like the top definitely needs to be short or tucked in for the look to work. i am typically a 2 in bottoms, and went with the small in this. the xs probably fits more like it's intended to, but it is very curve-hugging, and i was more comfortable with the looser fit of the small (especially since i am tucking in a blouse). there is stretch in the skirt, and the fabric has a nice feel.",5
"Amazing pants! i saw them at my local retailer and knew they would be great addition to my wardrobe (in-person is even better than photo!). they are flattering and i love that the pattern lends itself to many options...could be an ivory sweater or blouse or perhaps a mustard jacket...so much fun! i am 135 lbs, 5'7"" and went with the 6.",5
Love this beautiful sweater! it's become one of my wardrobe staples. it's got a great cut and i love the design.,5
"I bought the skirt in the green color and it is beautiful. this skirt is curve hugging, but in a sexy way. very comfortable as well.",5
"These are the softest jeans ever! i love the way that they hold their shape, and make my bum look amazing!! i am 5'3"" and they do come much longer than shown on the model...right below my ankle bone. i actually prefer this because they will be wearable right through fall if i pair them with booties! the fit is true to size...108 pounds and i got a 25. highly recommend!!",5
"I ordered this online in a m and l because i am usually one of those on the bottom - i will be returning both for a s. the fabric is great and a cool pattern, but it runs large by far. in addition to the large sizing the fabric has a decent stretch so that makes it even larger. i think the small will fit well and the cut is flattering - i am about 5'11'' and it hits below my knees, similar to the model in the picture, so i would definitely get this in petite if youre on the shorter side. it's al",5
Love this skirt! i have worn it to work with a simple black shirt for a great outfit! i have had many compliments on it. it is very flattering and comfortable!,5
"Really beautiful skirt. unique print (red) and stylish. keep in mind this is knit, stretchy, form fitting. as mentioned the skirt is very comfortable and a heavier texture fabric. i purchased a large (i am 5'7 and 154lbs) and don't like skirts too tight so i sized up. the large is fine however, i noticed at the bottom of the skirt it doesn't quite fit as slim as i would like. i suspect the m would be better. if you have a stomach it will show! i also noticed that the skirt seemed much longer on",5
"I ordered this skirt in both colors and they are just to die for. the fun fabrics make it a playful and trendy take on a timeless essential, and the fit is incredibly flattering. an added bonus: the fabric has give so it's also extremely comfortable. i hope they come out with more color options!",5
"I am sorry to say this blouse is way below all retailer standards. this top should have been placed on sale a long time ago! poor quality in cut, fabric, design. this is a top one would grab at a local box store for 19.99. the colors are not as vibrant. the shoulders ill fitted. and the fabric and threads are very cheap. i was expecting so much more.sorry retailer.....my favorite store to shop!",1
"I disagree with the most recent review! they are legging style fit but not leggings at all! they are a jean style with a patterning on them a texture.
great colors!",5
Beautiful and flowy blouse . bottom is very full so i recommend sizing down - 1 size. very feminine and i really like the colors and pattern. i am a 36c on top and found top flattering with pilcro serif legging like jeans and booties.,5
"I saw this shirt online, loved it, but unfortunately it was sold out in the regular size small. however, retailer shirts tend to be long on me, so i ordered a petite small. it fits great! i am actually happy i got a petite because i feel a regular would have been too long. the shirt comes to my hips. for reference i'm 5'8"" 145 lbs. and my measurements are 34-27-38.",5
"Comfy, cozy, and great bargain for the sale price.",5
"I purchased this shirt and was hoping to be able to wear it without a tank underneath (because of the lace detailing on the back). however, this shirt is a bit see-through, so i still had to wear a tank with it. it's very cute even with the tank though!",5
"I ordered the coral, size small, it's a beautiful peach color and the linen is very soft. it is longer, and roomier in the waist than i was expecting, however, with skinny jeans it looks great. the detail makes this top very eye-catching, i'm very happy with my purchase!",5
"This shirt is so flattering. i bought it in the recent ""it"" color but i wish it came in some additional brighter hues. this shirt is just so lovely. it's long in length too!",5
"I am 5' 3 3/4"" tall, and usually wear medium in retailer tops. i love this top. purchased same style in sleeveless this past summer and was hoping the style would return, as i was complimented every single time i wore my summer version! i do wear a cami underneath. i agree that in the picture the yoke doesn't seem pink, however i like it even better with the more pink hue as it gives an even more eye catching piece the pizzaz i look forward to seeing in retailer offers! i love retailerpo",5
"I love the flowy-beachy look of this jumpsuit, it is very comfortable, and super cute, my only ""gripe"" is that the hip part is pretty wide, hands in the pockets, you can't tell, but if i were to get this, i would want a xxs. length was ok not petite since it is a flowy look. colors are very nice too, kind of ""70's"", but i love it. i think i will get this if it goes to sale, even if it is a little big on me... i am 115 lbs, 30d chest and tried on xs.",5
I absolutely love this top! i own it in coral and white. it is simply beautiful and the linen fabric makes it comfortable and breathable. i am so happy i bought this top!,5
"This is a beautiful, light-weight summer top. i ordered the white - perfect for summer. very feminine. true to size. i am 117 5'3 34b and the x-small fit perfectly.",5
This poncho is so comfortable. fabric soft and not too hot. this goes with so many things. my favorite purchase this fall!,5
"I have been waiting for this poncho to hit my local retailer.  it was as good as it looks online. the perfect piece to put on over a tank or t-shirt. you can dress it up or down and i love that it has pockets. i wear a 10 and i bought the m/l, this is meant to be oversized so buy appropriately.",5
"Found this jumpsuit in standard size small/red motif (pictures don't do it justice) in-store and to my surprise, it actually fit! of course, it was billowy since i'm short/ 113lbs., and it came all the way down to the bottom of my ankles where they meet my feet, which i don't mind. i love that it almost looks like a maxi dress when on. the smocked bodice was snug for a size small so there is a little bit of skin bubbling out in the chest area/near my armpits..like normal women usually have. ladi",5
"I loved the fit and design so much that i splurged and purchased all three! the lavender has a blue tinge to it that makes it really unique. the coral is a little on the neon side but i love that and it's a great color for summer. i'm waiting for the white to arrive and hope it's actually white and not ivory, as retailer colors are sometime a little off. i'm petite and order the xxsp which fits like a dream. not too tight or loose, super comfortable and flattering. easy to pair with white, khaki,",5
"Short of calling it dark gray- which  isn't dark, but that's fine because i saw the picture. it's everything i wanted it to be. i just wish it was chiller here in georgia so i can wear it more often",5
Quality assembled;comfortable and stylish with 2-tone fabric; wash w/o shrinkage;pair with every rainbow color. nice alternative to jean days.,5
"I love this - great coverage, goes with everything, flattering pockets, soft and soothing taupey gray palette - a+. retailer does it again.",5
My husband bought me these joggers for a retreat i went on. they are so comfortable and really cute. i am usually a size 4 and the size small fit great with some room.,5
"This could worn with anything. tank top, long sleeves, gloves, jeans and pants. very high quality material. will be a staple in my wardrobe this fall!!!",5
"I have been searching around for new and unique clothes to wear to work. this top is cute, comfortable, and well made. these are all qualities that i look for when purchasing clothes. also the shirt is flattering for the stomach if you are like me and had a baby.",5
"I'll admit, it's been a few months since i've shopped at retailer. i feel like i have to try on just about everything because there doesn't seem to be much consistency between the brands. i'm so glad i wandered in our local store this week! this top is so beautiful in person and well-made. the embroidery is lovely and it's lined, so not too sheer. i'm tall and it was a good length, hitting just above the hip. i think it runs tts or maybe just a tad big. the s fit perfectly across the chest,",5
"I'm giving these leggings 5 stars although i did return them. first off i do love pilcro jeans and leggings. beware these are not jeans at all. the tag says serif legging. these are excellent leggings if that's what you're looking for. i thought they were jeans and was willing to spend the money on them, but not for leggings. i'll consider buying if they go on sale.",5
"I bought this in coral, it is soft and the fit is flattering. the perfect top for transitioning into fall here in the desert.",5
"This is such a classy, elegant and interest piece for your wardrobe. the fabric and cut is lovely and it drapes really nice. i love how it doesn't slide around on your frame when you move and the pockets are awesome - such a fun and practical extra. i thought the arms were a little tricky - but you would see the same issue with any cape style top. the gray is a nice color, but i wish it came in another option - a wine color would be amazing.",5
"As soon as i saw this online i knew i'd love it, and when it arrived in my store i scooped it up right away!!! the poncho is exactly as it appears online. the color is different variations of gray. the fabric is soft and not itchy at all. it's longer in back, has arm holes on either side and lays beautifully. it's long enough to wear with leggings, but looks clean enough to pair with jeans and a top. this is light enough for cool summer nights, but will be my fall go to once the cold weather com",5
"This is a gem. stretchy, graphic, easy to wear, lightweight and so fun! the best thing about this is it can be worn as a jumpsuit or as a higher waisted pant! i've seen it paired with a pilcro denim jacket and cute sandals, and then worn as pants with a black tank, jacket and silver belt. i love that this can be dressed up or down...you could even throw it on over your bathing suit as a coverup. i would go true to size on this one since there is some room and the top has great stretch.",5
This is a very pretty top with a nice flow. i love the delicate pattern. it fits perfectly and is great for work or the weekend.,5
I love the navy blue color. they are a fun alternative to skinny jeans. the fit is great and they are super comfortable!,5
"So many compliments and so comfortable--all i want from a pair of pants. i am 5'8+ and around 135 and a little bit of a pear, and these fit perfectly in size 28l. they felt a little tight at first and then stretched to be ideal. i bought black and really love the softness, the rise, and the way they go with everything. thinking of going back for one in the dark red. this will be a winter staple to dress up or down. 
i just hope they don't wear out too quickly!",5
"These are incredibly soft and comfortable. they are only for inside lounging, because they are a bit see through and have that long-johns type of material on it.",5
"This is so pretty! it was beautiful in white but i bought the blue because the fabric is a little bit see through. i'm 5' 4"" and weigh about 135 and this shirt fit just like on the model in the picture. it was a nice neat loose. not sloppy at all.",5
"I've never owned a romper before but after trying it on at the store, i fell in love! i'm pear-shaped 5""4 at 185#. i got a med and it fits beautifully with just enough room to not be baggy. i got the red mitif. super flattering.",5
"I purchased the one marked with the red dot (the one with the larger pattern and orange in it). i spied it in the store as soon as it arrived. i fell absolutely in love with it immediately. i am normally xl but this piece runs large so i tried the l and it's perfect. very bohemian, which i adore. first time out i folded over the top and wore it as pants and it looked fabulous with a black top. it can also be worn the way it is shown. i have also belted it and worn it with a black jacket, as show",5
I bought the top that goes with the pants & live that it's comfortable to wear at home yet looks good enough to to go anywhere. easy to care for. very happy with this!!,5
This jumpsuit is absolutely fabulous. i normally don't wear jumpsuit but i like this one very much. it can be dresse down or dressied up. i really recommend this to everyone any shape who have. very relaxing and beautiful.,5
"I love the pilcro line and these leggings (yes definitely more a legging than jean) did not disappoint. however, i did think the material would have a little more substance and weight.  they are pricey, so i am hoping that the thinness of the material will not prevent them from holding up well.",5
This dress is exactly what i hoped it would be! super sexy and great material.,5
I really like the gentle flow of the fabric. this top can be worn casual or dressy by adding jewelry or or a scarf.,5
"I have this color also in the grey - flattering, interesting shirt. i have think hips but a fuller waist, the vertical lines of this shirt design suggest otherwise. great to pair with torn up skinny jeans! love the petite line now in portland.",5
"This dress is really cute and is a lightweight knit that is great for warmer days. the color is a lovely dusty rose that looks just like the picture. since it is a knit material and does tend to stretch out, i did go down one size so that it would be more form fitting. the length on the petite size is perfect for me.",5
"I saw this online and loved it. i wanted to wait for a sale and a promotion, but this tee-shirt sold out in the color holly. completely sold out but for petite. i bought a s and a m. the small works. it is comfortable. it can be dressy or very casual. i bought the white and the carbon. it is a different style on a tee. if you notice the front neck and the bottom of the back you will see what i mean. i recommend this highly. i can't imagine anyone not liking it.",5
Love the way this tee looks and feels. so comfortable and fun! good length. perfect jeans tee.,5
I love this top. it's not just an average tee due to the asymmetry in the seams. it's super soft and comes in some great colors. i wish it was slightly longer on the sides but otherwise perfect tee!,5
"Purchased this t-shirt in white. it's lightweight and slightly sheer. perfect for layering. looks cute with a poncho, blazer or on it's own. really wish it was available in black.",5
This is my new favorite dress. it's a lovely fall mustard shade. the design really accentuates the waistline. i would buy the other colors in a heartbeat. on my petite frame the dress hits just above my knees.,5
"Great quality, flattering cut- could even be used as a little day dress for warm weather! love the detail of the buttons on the back and the delicacy of the straps.",5
Absolutely love the jacket! wore it out in nyc at a rooftop bar and many people complimented on it. the faux fur is soft and pink color is beautiful. it is trendy but classy and can be worn dressy or dressed down with boyfriend jeans and booties. perfect transitional jacket from day to night =-),5
"I was on my way out the door when i noticed this adorable t-shirt and of course i grabbed one and went to try it on. i love it, it's a different take on a t-shirt. it's comfortable and stylish. i ended up buying the white one and gold colored one. i'm even thinking about grabbing a couple more colors.",5
"This will be my go-to shirt for fall! its a great layering piece with just enough detail to make it different than a plain crew neck long sleeve...the neckline is unique & the slit in the back of the shirt adds interest. fit is slim, nicely tailored which makes it perfect for layering. i will likely purchase more colors once on sale! i purchased the dark grey and color is just as expected. my only drawback is how thin the material is - i can see it getting snags or holes easily, but i will deal",5
"I was looking for a white shirt to layer with this winter. this shirt looks great on its own, but it has also done great as a long sleeved layer under vests, etc. it's a little thin so i only gave it 4 stars for quality, but it is holding up well so far.",5
"I purchased this dress on super sale and i'm so happy i did. it looks better on me than on the model and that's never the case. the material is soft corduroy with comfortable give. it moves with me. true to size (i ordered a size 8 and for reference, i'm 5'2"", 140lbs, 36c). love this staple fall/winter piece. i wore it to a conference for work with footless tights and a black cardigan. i can't say enough how comfortable it is on! it has a structured give if that makes any sense. love it!",5
"This can be worn now on its own or as the weather gets colder it will make a great layering piece
i bought one and liked it so much i bought it in another color",5
Great fitted tee. nice styling. hard to find tees that are fitted-- they seem to make most of them these days like boxes i suppose because it's easier to make. this looks great and feels good. true to size. loving it!,5
"The dress is true to size, but has generous stretch to it. i absolutely love this dress, i compliments where needed and hides what needs to be hid, for me the tummy!",5
Love this shirt and the details on the collar.,5
Love it fits great very comfy goes with all,5
"Soft comfortable material- love the carbon color. great everyday casual tee but with a nice bit of detail.
i liked it so much that i ordered a second one!",5
"I'm always searching for a ""dressed up tees"" and these were fabulous! true to size and great quality!",5
"This shirt was better than expected. the fit is fitted but still flows. it's comfortable and the material is great. it goes with anything, ive tucked it into pants and skirts but i've also just worn with leggings. looks great either way! im going to buy more of this shirt.",5
"This is a nice, easy, go to shirt that i will be grabbing for this fall. comfy, but still styled to add a little fun in the everyday white tee.",5
"Love the gorgeous mustard/goldenrod shade but it's unflattering to my skintone (makes my olive-tan look more sallow). all the versions of the tied dresses that holding horses has come out with are fantastic in fit and flattering to the tummy. if you are busty/broad back/wide rib cage--size up. if you have generous hip/bum curves, give both your regular",5
I love this kimono! the material and construction are beautiful but the one size fits all may be too big for a petite frame. you can throw it over the simplest outfit and make an instant glamour statement!,5
"The knit is thin.  it's more for a chilly spring or warm fall day.  but, it's not see-through, although a bit light weight.

the style if figure-flattering and fits tts.  i am short and i found the sleeves, length perfect.  so if you are tall, you ""might"" find this shorter in the arms or body on you.

i bought the purple and it's a great color.  love it!",5
"This is a super cute peasant top. super light weight and perfect for summer, looks good with jeans or shorts, perfect for summer, spring, or fall. colors are super pretty and bright.",5
"I love anything orange- when i saw this coat online, i ordered it as i loved all the features. the features of the coat are fun- however the coat came all bunched up in the package. i let it hang for a couple of days but the wrinkles were awful and even steaming and an iron would not take the creases away. i tried the coat on - the buckles were poorly made. i ended up returning this jacket.",1
"There was nothing i liked about this coat. it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind. the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on. i usually like oranges too, but even this color turned me off.",1
"I love this dress! it's super comfortable and can easily be dressed down with a jean jacket and some sandals, or dressed up with leather and a good pair of heels. the fit is spot on and very slimming, and i like that the length isn't too short as well.",5
"This super cute skirt has a beautiful drape and overall fit. i was afraid the tie at the front would emphasize my slight tummy, but to the contrary, the skirt is flattering and slimming. at 5'3"", the front of the skirt hits at my upper to mid knee. 118 lbs., 26"" waist, 36"" hips, size 2 regular is a perfect fit.",5
"Dress is pretty and works are a tunic, too. i'm short 5'1.5"" but the fabric does not overwhelm me.",5
"I fell in love with this dress online and ordered it despite some of the reviews that claimed it cut too high in the leg and couldn't be worn as a dress. i thought it was lovely enough to wear as a long shirt even if that was the case. however, when it arrived  the side hems were not cut too high for me and i have successfully worn it as a dress (receiving many compliments along the way). i'm 5'2 (and a quarter) inches, 117lbs. i ordered an extra small and it fits perfectly. the fabric is soft a",5
"This shirt is made of a thicker material, so you are able to wear it through multiple seasons. i also liked that it is a bit longer. however, it runs a little large, so i would order a size down if possible.",5
"I got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store. we loved that this could be worn stand alone, with leggings, or as an over-shirt. it's very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe.",5
"I love this dress! i do agree with the other reviewers - it does come up higher on the sides. it has a hi-lo hem style on me, but i'm short (5'3"") and got the petite xxs and it's not too short to wear as a dress. it's super cute!! if you're short(er) and don't mind showing a little leg, i highly recommend it :)",5
"This is an absolutely gorgeous sweater. the colors are just as they appear online, but the length stated for the petite version is way off. i suspected as much from the picture, but decided to try it anyway. the petite small went down to my ankles! too bad. i would have loved this sweater if it were an above-the-knee or even at-knee length.",5
"This dress is beautiful. i cannot begin to express how pleased i am with the design and timelessness of this dress. in my mind, it takes me back to the 20s and 30s more so than a flapper dress as it exudes the simplicity yet elegance of the early 20th century. the champagne color is light and airy and it is incredibly comfortable to wear. i am wearing this to a musical at the tuts theatre in two weeks with pearls.",5
Great dress with just the right amount of movement and flow everywhere. perfect to dress up for a night out or wear it casually during the day,5
"I love this jumper! i'm 5'1"" and the 00p fit beautifully. i needed no alterations. i found it true to size. i can see that if my torso was any longer, it wouldn't fit though. i found the quality of the fabric was nice, it just gathers slightly, but you can see that on the model too in the photo. that doesn't bother me.",5
"The dress ran big but is tight at the bust, material is sooo sheer and the shape of the dress is off. you can't see the ruffle/ flounce that runs the bottom of the dress.",1
"I bought this originally for my daughter but fell in love with it when i tried it on and kept it for myself! it is a cotton/polyester blend so it is very comfortable to wear. the length fits nice as well. i have received so many compliments wearing it with dress pants and also with jeans! thank you for making an item that is both pretty, flexible, and meets the needs of young women (and their moms!)",5
"I bought this skirt yesterday and love, love, love it!! very flattering, will go with anything. i am 5'5, 127, and size 6 fit perfectly.",5
"This is a great dress for me to wear to work, lounging on a sunday and everywhere in-between. i'd even wear it over a bathing suite on a chilly beach. highly recommend it!",5
"I tried this on twice in nyc and loved this jacket. it is so much cuter in person. my only concern is whether the mesh fabric will hold up over time and at this price point it needs to last more than one season. it has adorable embroidery on it, the colors are vibrant. you need to see this in person.",5
"I love this dress! i will be living in it this fall and winter! the color is perfect, the fabric is soft, seriously it is so conformable and cute! i will style it with booties, tall boots, with vests, wear it as a tunic! i love it as a dress, i didn't think it was too short at all! i'm 5'7"" so things tend to be short on my anyway but i thought this was perfect and hit in the right spots! love love love it!",5
I really liked this dress. i agree with the others that say the side seam comes up pretty high. i think i'd wear as a tunic or open like the model. i can't justify full price though. tts. my normal med fit.,5
"This pink tank is a wonderful addition to my go-to basics. i love the color, which is a nice deep pink that is pretty spot on in terms of accuracy to the online photo. it is a wonderful comfy fabric and the side knot adds nice visual interest to make this top appealing and unique. i also appreciate the wide straps, which means i can wear a normal bra instead of a strapless one without worrying about straps playing peek-a-boo. the only drawback is size. i ordered my usual xs (i am 5'5"", 110 lbs,",5
I absolutely love this skirt! i purchased both a medium and a large. i found that it ran big. i typically wear a size 10-12. i ended up keeping the medium and it was perfect!,5
"I don't know how this dress doesn't have more of a following! it's really perfect. i will say, i am tall (5'8"") and lanky. the dress is oversized, but not overly so, drapes beautifully, and will work for any season. fabric is divine. i plan to wear this to work, for travel, on weekends, etc. love the cream/deep charcoal color. at the sale price, this really is a great, versatile find.",5
"This blouse is so pretty! i love the design, the material, and the pattern is so unique. i love the sleeves and how they billow out just above the elbow and come in at the wrist. i think the amount of fabric is perfect and would not be nearly as nice with less. the cut around the top where it starts to gather and fall is so feminine and modern princess-feeling. i hope they make this same style in other colors and prints!!! i adore it and feel so good wearing it! if i could change anything, i'd m",5
"This is a great light weight tank. true to size, but size up if you prefer a baggier fit, size down for a closer fit. your preference for fit should be your guide. (i prefer a closer fit, so i choose a xs, i am a 6-8 in tops) the arm holes are slim and high so you are completely covered in all sizes. excellent drape, the twist in the front is just perfect! looks great with jeans, print joggers, and even wide leg pants. i imagine it would be fantastic with a pencil skirt - denim perhaps. hope it",5
Fits great & super comfortable. i love this dress!,5
I love wearing sweaters when it gets cooler out but hate the bulkiness that comes with them. this is a super cute sweater that isn't too bulky and gives you the sexiness you're looking for! great material.,5
I sized down to an xs based on reviews and the fit was perfect. i am 34 b and usually take a small. i like the classic lines with the sexy edge. this is a heavier sweater but perfect for our houston fall and winter. if you size down the sweater has a much nicer fit to it and is not at all loose fitting. it just skims your curves.,5
"I am absolutely addicted to tunics. so, when i saw this on sale, with an extra 30% off, i went for it. i'm glad i did! it's absolutely beautiful. i love the opposing stripe patterns, the hi-lo feature (very subtle), and the tie back. so cute!

if you're petite like me, though, you may want to wear something underneath--it does cut a bit low in the chest area.",5
"Got this in white and love the scallop detail. the material is also super soft and stretchy. i would've absolutely loved this in black, but i feel like the white enhances my hips a bit too much. i think this would be super cute on a taller frame. got my usual xs and it was a perfect fit!",5
"I got this dress in the gray, size small and it fits me perfectly. it hides flaws in your figure and is nice enough that it can be worn to the office and then out later for a date or dinner. i did not try on the white/black combo because i thought the white top part might be too sheer. unlike other reviewers, i think the contrast of fabrics works. i'm not sure why there are negative reviews here, i must have the right body type for it because i love it!",5
"This jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful. i usually wear a size 4 or small in everything at retailer. sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it, too tight on chest and arms. i recommend going a size up. also this jacket is really cropped, probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it, otherwise might appear too short.",5
This skirt is hot. i love it and would marry it if possible. super pretty. the jewel hem looks awesome. buy it! we can be twins.,5
"The fabric on this top is just so soft. it's a thin cotton knit, and drapes beautifully.

the top runs tts, but.....it is tailored to the body. it's not loose and wide in the width. the length hits the top of the hips just as shown.

this works for casual or dress. for dress, i just put a fancy rhinestone pin over where the knot is. btw, i bought this in black, which is why adding the pin glams it up. although i bought it in black, it's not sheer so a cami isn't needed.",5
"Love this top! simple, yet so stylish.",5
"I rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever. but this dress is awful. i ordered the black and white. the fabric is very poor quality. the colors are washed out. i almost didn't try it on, but i did and found that, for me, the fit was terrible (though some of the reviewer pictures are cute).",1
"I ordered this to wear for a holiday party hoping to have something unique and dressy. it was too bulky at the shoulders and looked like something a football player would wear. the little ruffled flower pieces were random at the top and stuck out in all the wrong directions. it wasn't as elegant as the model pic (is it ever?) and for this price should fit like a glove. went back within seconds. also, it's pretty short, and bulky short isn't flattering on too many people.",1
"These are excellent. as previous reviewers noted, they are a thin material, and there isn't much stretch. that being said, they have a casual, work-appropriate men's wear vibe (the extra fabric in the crotch region contributing to this). if you really don't like the extra fabric, wearing them a little higher and closer to the natural waist should solve the problem. the navy is a little lighter in person than on the site, just fyi--it's less easy to mistake for black, which is alright in my book.",5
I don't buy many jackets (retired) but i think they are still useful. i had my doubts about this jacket -- like could they really get the trim straight at this price? but they did. the jacket is casual but sophisticated. i got the grey and the color is just as pictured. i will probably wear with dark jeans and i see several creative mashups with things in my closet. i am pleased and i think you will be too!,5
This is a great layering tank that is super comfy! the sale price is a bargain!,5
"Effortless and super cute! i'm currently wearing my blue tunic for the first time with black leggings and booties - i absolutely love the everyday comfort of this piece! a few have mentioned length as being an issue - i'm wearing a regular s (my normal size) at 5'7"" and find the length similar to the model's. the cut on this is perfect - i was worried that it would look like a plaid sack on, but it's a slim cut that looks polished without needing to be belted. this will surely be a go-to for me",5
"I like this top a lot - it's cuter in person than it looks on the model -- it's a little heathered. it definitely fits slimmer one me than on the model, and i'm pretty small on top.

overall, nice to see a reasonably priced basic t on the retailer site",5
"Love, love these jeans. being short they come right to my ankle. super soft and don?t require any hemming. i ordered my typical jean size of 26 and they fit like a glove. would love to have these in black and grey.",5
These tights are perfect. they seem like they will last a couple seasons with minimal wear. just the slightest texture and not shiny. i got the beige/brown to layer with dresses/skirts and boots. love.,5
"This shirts dresses up anything-tights, jeans or a skirt. love the color and the length",5
"I was surprised how great this blouse looks on! the color and texture are awesome.... very well made, but runs a tad small. this will be my new go to when i open my closet!",5
"Love this top, super soft and drapes great, even after washing. it is pretty long and loose, but it is so comfy and cute to wear with jeans or even joggers!",5
"Love these tanks so much i have them in every color. i wear them layered under blouses, thermals, henleys, blazers, etc. i'm typically and extra small but the small fits perfectly.",5
These jeans are so comfortable. they are well-made. they are the perfect pair of jeans. the only thing i do not love is they stretch out a little bit after wearing. i am going to order these again in the next smaller size.,5
Comfortable and soft are two of my favorite words when it comes to clothes. this shirt meets both requirement. it is a great length and can be casual and dressed up. must have for fall and winter.,5
"This shirt spoke to me, as soon as i entered the store! i love the colorful plaid, the flattering cut, and the light, airy material. at very least, i think this will be a three-season go to!",5
"This is the softest, most perfectly cut basic. love the black, wish the white was a true white or ivory instead of heathered. as usual with retailer basics, i prefer the regular length despite being petite with a short torso.",5
"This product is just what i wanted. it was a great color and nice quality for the price. it is tighter than the model, but i am curvy and that's usually the case. looks cute with a patterned pant and jewelry!",5
"Bought this shirt in red in my usual size small. it is so comfortable and easy to wear. i am 5' 8.5"" tall and it fall on me similar to the model in the picture. not sure if i can wear with leggings--may be too short in front. i'm looking forward to layering it under sweaters and sweater vests for a pop of color.",5
"I am giving it five stars because the colors and design are so beautiful. but i am a medium, size 6 around 5' 8, and i chose the m/l, which is just too big. i also found a run in the fabric, which is very loose and knit-like in places. but i don't care, i am exchanging for another one in small.",5
"I purchased this top on 2 colors...a great go to....stylish, soft and very comfortable.",5
"This tunic is a great way to wear the plaid trend right now without it being the traditional collared shirt. it's fun, comfortable and has great style. the first time i wore it i got tons of compliments! i'm 5'8"" and the back of the shirt goes to the back of my knees, i usually wear a size 12 and the large fit great!",5
I'm about 10-15 lbs overweight and the material clings a bit. this would be a wonderful top for someone who has a nice shape.,5
"When i saw this on a model at my retailer store, i fell for it. i love the colors and the weave of this kimono. it looks great over anything denim or chambray in particular. it will be useful for cooler days and nights or air-conditionied places. the knit cuffs hold it in place. i got many compliments on it the first time i wore it.",5
"Pretty blues! colors are exactly as pictured! fits perfectly; not boxy, not tight, just comfortable! i'm 5'9 and this is tunic length on me!",5
"I love everything about this tunic : the color, fabric and design! i am very happy with this perches!",5
"I absolutely love this top, especially for fl weather.
it's soft and falls just a tad longer in the back and is a little fitted in the bust area with a very feline look.
i had the tank as well and just love the satin trim!
i will say it runs a little smaller than the tank bc i have xs in the tank and needed a small in this!
love it!",5
"The title says it all...
perfect go-to tank for underneath tops. smooths out lines. purchased in a large, so if you're between sizes, may want to size up.",5
"I was first attracted to this tunic by the beautiful, bright colors; tried it on, and it was becoming, comfortable, and perfect for my laid-back lifestyle. i just bought it a week ago, have worn it three times already. i bought the blue.",5
"I was in love with this top as soon as i saw it. i love the patchwork and i think it is well put together. i've worn it once (the day i got it, i was so excited) and washed it and it is still in great shape.
i liked it with the sleeves rolled up and the bottom tucked in, as it was a little longer than i'm used to. but nothing too long. my torso is short.
the material is not thick or heavy. and the sleeves and some patches are kinda thin. nice material, but not something to wear if it's very ch",5
"I have these in many different colors, some with stripes. very versatile and i wear them all year around.holds well through the washing. love these tank top.",5
"I've worn citizens for almost 12 years now, i keep going back because i have an athletic figure (my thighs and butt are bigger than my waist), and usually citizens fit and hug all the right places and are made with a certain quality expectation - these did not meet any of those standards, the ripped as soon as i put them on. the material seemed cheap.",1
"Love this top! i'm 5'7, 145 pounds, athletic build, and the medium falls slightly loosely and very nicely over my hips. it is quite low cut, so i wear a tank under it in a professional environment, but it's fine to wear sans tank top in a more casual setting. i really love the back, as the straps are sexy and show off my shoulders. the material seems to be good quality, and i would order this in more colors if it were available!",5
"I had read all the reviews about the regular length being too long (they were out of stock on the petite when i ordered) but i took a chance and ordered the regular size. i love it! it is a little long in the back, but i think that makes it a little more fun than your standard plaid shirt. so cute with skinny jeans and leggings! it is one of my favorite fall tops! i got the blue but might go back and get the red since it would be so great for the holidays!",5
"It's perfect. perfect fit, long enough to wear leggings and cover my behind. it's perfect.",5
"Look carefully at the pics of the back. if this style and the color suit you, just go ahead and order this one. it looks just like the pics, and is light, comfortable and true to size. the kind of top you can throw on when you are in a hurry and look great. however, because the back is sheer from halfway down, maybe not for work if you work in an office. moth is one of my favorite brands at retailer and this one is easy-peasy. i am 5'3"", 34c/28/38 and ordered the regular s.",5
"I just received this top in the mail and i couldn't be happier with how it fits and feels on. might have to wear a camisole under with a bit see through in front. it is very true to size and drapes beautifully with the back being very feminine. i am 5'6"" and the length falls just about the same on myself as does the model. i will wear with skinny jeans with the nice length working well with them.",5
"I love this top. i am 5'8"", 135, 36d, ordered a small and it fit perfectly. length is long, but i liked it. i paired it with grey jeans and black wedge boots...love this top!",5
"This shirt is comfortable, loose, but doesn't make you look like you're shapeless. it compliments.",5
"There's something wonderful about this tee. it's the way it fits. it hangs so nicely and is a wonderful year round item. i bought it in black for myself and one for my daughter. she ordered another color and i did, too. when i bought it, one of the gals at the store said it had been such a popular tee this year and, once i put it on, i understood why. i give it a high rating!",5
"If you're not a petite and are reading this, read on :) i'm always on the lookout in the petite section because many times us fuller girls can fit into these. 
________
pros:
- tts for me. i'm normally a size 10/12 (m/l) in the regular sizes. i tried on the 12p and it fit everywhere perfectly, especially at the bust in which i'm a 36c.
- fabric is on the thicker side, but that's what gives it this adorable shape, besides already being fit-and-flare.
- pockets :) i always lean towards dresse",5
"This pair of age stevie capris is everything that i could want in a pair of jeans!! soft, sexy (without being skintight) and the perfect color of blue!! i am 5'3""/108 lbs and the 25 was a perfect fit!! these hit about an inch above my ankle and looked amazing (think legs that look a mile long!!) with booties one night and nude heels the next!",5
"I usually wear a s. the reviews were helpful. looking at the pic this shirt does look a little on the fitted side. i ordered a size m & it fits perfectly! the sleeve length is fine too! the colors are dark, not as in the photo. i do like the frayed edge look too. i have some skinnys like that. i had been looking at this shirt for months but thought it was a bit pricey. at the sale price plus the promo discount it makes it very much worth it. no regrets. hope this isn't tmi.. of note: the dark bl",5
"Wow.. love this blazer! it's not as structured as some blazers , but the woven fabric hugs in the right places. fantastic addition and great alternative to the good'ol black blazer.. great versatility work to play. nice weight for fall, but will also do well for my fl winter. it's longer than some of my other blazers, but i like it.. with the front pockets as they are, it makes for a unique design that gets noticed. i got the size 4 and i have broad shoulders for someone @ 135lbs.. makes for a n",5
"I love this shirt! great fabric, nice quality, flattering fit. i have gotten this shirt in 4 colors. my only complaint is that the color names do not match the actual color.. not sure who named these. the orange is a lovely burgundy, and the white is actually oatmeal.",5
"One of the best tops i have ever bought! i love he material and the style. the satin trim around the edges adds a classy touch. i wore this top with yoga pants and then with jeans and it was perfect for both outfits! the shirt is true to size. i wear a size small and it fit perfectly (5'7"", 145lbs, 34b).",5
"This dress can be dressed up or down. it looks cute w/ a black open sweater and looks great alone. the fabric is very soft. although it isn't fitted, it doesn't have too much material either, so it is very flattering on. the back yoke also has the white embroidered flowers which finishes off a quality look. the pockets are nice and light inside. i usually wear a 10/12 and the large fit perfectly. i was also lucky to get it on sale ;)",5
I am most pleased with this tunic. purchased it in red. nice quality and very comfortable casual top. it has a flattering cut that isn't boxy for a long tunic so it's flattering. the weight of the fabric is substantial but not heavy or stiff so it doesn't add any bulk which is a bit slimming. it would work well for a wide variety of body types. i may buy the blue as well.,5
Love these jeans! flattering and comfortable!! great length for short girl!! worth the money!,5
"I received this tee in grey as gift and immediately went online to buy another!

beware because the color names are confusing. i originally thought it was a mix up in the naming on the website so i ordered the ""red"", thinking i'd get the red colored tee. however, the ""red"" tee is actually a light orange color. the ""orange"" tee is actually a burgundy/red color.

i ended up keeping the orange colored tee although i actually wanted the red color, because i really do love the quality of this shirt!",5
I got this jacket in the gray. the fit is amazing and it is soooooo comfortable. i love that it is a bit less structured - but still looks polished.,5
"Beautiful neutral color in a comfortable fabric. fits tts. i am 5 ft 2 in and went with the petite. it is a midi on me. i have other skirts from retailer from past years in similar fabric and will say that overtime the waist will stretch even if hand washed carefully. so that being said, buy your size in this skirt, don't go bigger to get a longer length. you can wear it lower on your hips if you like it longer which i think actually looks more flattering. in any case, it's a great piece that no o",5
"It is delightful, dreamy and yes it is quite right. perfect fit, i wear a size 8 and it was right on!!!",5
"Great skirt, easy to wear. perfect weight for spring/fall. very comfortable while still looking stylish. the xs fit well.",5
"These are very versatile pants. you can pair them with a tank top and flip flops and be ready for a casual summer day or pair them with a dressy top and heels and be ready for a formal function. i've only worn these once to a formal city function and felt put together and comfortable. with the pants i wore a black lace button up top, satin peep toe heels, black tuxedo jacket and a chunky necklace...very cute. my husband loved it. i'm 5'3"", 117 lbs and the xs fit perfectly. they only downside to",5
"This general sweatshirt is cute, stylish and can be dressed up or down. a fresh alternative to the standard grey sweatshirt with leggings for casual mornings.",5
"I was looking for a top that would be comfortable as fall was approaching and this hit the mark! it isn't fitted but it doesn't look sloppy either. though it is comfy and is called a ""sweatshirt"" the fabric allowed me to pair it with a charcoal skirt. i am very pleased with this shirt and would highly recommend it as it can be worn casually with jeans or paired with a skirt.",5
"I tried this skirt on in a size medium. i am usually a small (4-6, 39 inches around the hips and butt) but there were no size smalls. the medium looked good but the waistline may have been a tad loose. the texture of the skirt is wonderful and it is lined! overall, the quality seemed good and it had a nice heft to it. the only thing i might say is that is is quite long--closer to my ankles and i'm just shy of 5' 9"" and leggy to boot (i wear a 33"" inseam with flats). with tall boots on, you saw j",5
"Saw these in store and had to have them. online pictures do not do them justice. great pattern, fabric and features. can be dressed up or down. sizing is accurate--i am 5' 4"" and 117 lbs and bought an xs. they fit perfectly. wish they had more colors/patterns to purchase.",5
"I received these pants today and they're perfect. as another reviewer stated, ""i would definitely not wear these for lounging"" you can dress them up or down. i feel like these will be my favorite go-to pants this spring. i highly recommend the design and pockets are perfect",5
"I hesitated to buy this skirt even though it was love at first sight. i was afraid it would be to heavy, and add weight. i'm so happy i ordered this one, it'll be a closet staple for me. i love skirts, and am blessed to live in a mild climate in california. i can wear it all year long. right now i can pair it with a slim turtleneck tucked in, with high heel boots, or heels, later can pair with crisp white button up tide at the waist, and strappy sandals, or a tank top, and sandals. it goes with",5
"Ugh! i am not sure how anyone is giving this good reviews. i tried small, medium and large on and huge huge huge, boxy, fabric bunched at the shoulders and did i mention it's way too boxy? the fabric and pattern are so pretty but the fit is just awful. i would try this one on before purchasing.",1
"I agree with the previous reviewer - the color variation is much more subtle than what is shown online. i would not have bought it had i not seen it ""in real life"". this is a super cute, soft and comfortable shirt. it fits tts and can be worn with jeans, leggings or a skirt. for reference i'm 5""7 and 122 lbs and i took a small but probably could have gone with xs as well but i like the extra room.",5
Love this sweatshirt! will look great with gray pilcro jeans i bought recently. xs fits perfectly and i am usually a s or xs.,5
"Not your classic sweatshirt. can be worn with black, grey, mauve",5
"I so wanted to like this dress i ordered it for summer graduation and weddings. i usually wear a 4/s and even the xs is was too pig. it drapes like a smock. the material is heavy. the only thing pretty about this dress is the pattern and color.

still looking for the perfect dress...",1
"I am not generally a fan of sweatshirts but when i saw this on a recent retailer email, i new i had to check it out. the colors are more vibrant in person and not muted like the photo but this wasn't a deal breaker for me. because of the boxy shape, i went with a s. i love the cozy feel and that it is still stylish. i can see this piece getting a lot of use this fall/winter. in fact, i am wearing it right now!",5
"I haven't worn these yet but i wouldn't wear them just to ""lounge"" in. i wear an xs & they fit good & tts. they have an elastic waist but it drapes nice & doesn't bunch like some do. the material is soft & hangs nice. & doesn't seems like it will wrinkle. love the pattern of the black print ones. it's black, tan & white & kind of a paisley print. i think it looks better on than in the picture.",5
"I bought this top to add some more color and pattern to my summer wardrobe. it is really cute and a flattering cut. i just had a baby, so it's perfect for showing some curves without clinging. if anything, i'd say it maximizes my bustline more than i expected, but is still very flattering. i think i'm still getting used to my new bustline ;) soft, comfy fabric. not too hot. i get compliments when i wear it!",5
"Very old color and item. a little full, but comfortable.",5
"Wore this dress recently on a work trip. traveled very well, cut and fabric are super flattering",5
"I was hesitant about buying this at first because i'm busty (f-cup), but i love this top and have received a lot of compliments on it. and then i tried it on again at home with leggings and loved it. it's a great spring time top to wear with leggings and boots.",5
"This is the most perfect dress i've ever bought. i'm 5'8"" and the length was perfect. the cut is flattering and very slimming. the fabric is gorgeous and the pattern is stunning. please offer more dresses in this cut!!",5
"Love this top. bought it in black and first day i wore it to a party and i think everyone gave me a compliment! it is very flattering to my shape. have a bit of a pooch, and can't even tell. looks great with skinny jeans. look forward to wearing many more times",5
Very happy with my purchase. fit very nice! already received compliments!,5
"I bought this top in the store and love it. i was surprised to see negative reviews online. i am small chested, curvier on the bottom. this top does have a wide and short fit but the cut is flattering. all three colors are beautiful. i wear it with high waist short jean shorts and it looks very fresh.",5
"I ordered the xl and it fits me the same as pictured on the model so it's true to size. the peplum is very comfortable. i love the mix of colors, especially for fall. i've always had great luck with the fit & wear of this brand. i'd love to see this same style done in lighter colors for summer.",5
"Fits well, comfortable and flattering. i wouldn't call this pattern fabric purple though. it is definitely multi colored and purple should not be called the dominate color.. the picture is an accurate representation of the color.",5
Lovely top that will be a great year-round staple to my wardrobe. peplum and pleats are flattering and not bulky. good weight for spring and beautiful for fall with a cardigan. looking forward to wearing it with high -rise jeans and and pencil skirts.,5
"This top is so pretty. i purchased the peach color. it does run large so you will need to size down. you do not need to wear a cami which is nice in the summer. it will look great with jeans, white jeans, shorts, dress it up or down. its not suppose to fit tight... love it!",5
"I lucked out and found one of these in my local retailer and i absolutely love it. fits well, although, i do think that the sleeves run a tad bit narrow when they are folded up, but i prefer the dress with the sleeves down anyway. fits very true to size. i can't wait to wear this with boots and leggings!",5
"Retailer consistently provides unique, sophisticated and quality made clothing. with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies, i shop with them exclusively. i suppose that i can't expect 100% perfection from retailer-but 99% of the time-that's what i get. this is that 1%...this sweater is truly awful! i cannot (or find it very difficult at least) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that, had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front",1
"I ordered this in a s (for reference, i am 5'7"", 128-130 lb, 32dd, with a 27"" waist), and it fits nicely. i have a fairly large chest, but i didn't find that the pleats laid awkwardly or over-accentuated my boobs, but i got the purple motif so the pattern (and the higher neckline) may have helped keep the top looking cute and stylish but still modest. on me the top drapes a little more than than it does on the model, but it's flattering and not at all sloppy thanks to the fabric, which has a jus",5
"This top is absolute perfection. i don't think the photo does it justice as it looks so much better untucked. i don't even have great toned arms, but it's still so flattering. i got the gray one amd might get another color. great value, as well! i'm petite - 5'1"" and bought my usual size small.",5
"I really am happy with this purchase! i am only 5'1 and this will be a perfect dress for me, the cuts hit at just the right spot!",5
"I know a lot of folks thought this top was too big/boxy, but i'm pretty slim up top with a big booty (quintessential pear shape), and i think the shape is totally flattering. your mileage may vary, but with free returns i'd just try it on first.  i sized down one size, which helped, and got the raspberry  colored one. i adore the color -- it's impossibly vibrant, and beautiful for spring summer or fall. the eyelets don't have any cloth underneath, just bare skin,  but they're so small that i don",5
I absolutely love this blouse...i ordered it in peach..then waited for the raspberry to come back in my size...now i have 2 colors...it runs really large....but putting a tank or cami underneath is fun :-),5
"I'm surprised there are no reviews on this blouse yet! i've had it for a couple of months and love it! it looks great in the spring with my flora retailer infinity scarf. the color is beautiful...i've gotten many compliments on this too. it fits well and has a small texture, which makes it more interesting.",5
Must wear tank under or i feel immodest due to eyelet holes. beautiful. i'm machine washing w delicates n hang dry. comes out great. easy breezy.,5
"Great dramatic cardigan, wearable art, and not for the meek. i'll wear with a leather skirt and boots, jeans and boots, or a dress and boots. if the lack of closure at top bothers you, attach something --be creative. i like the movement that alternately hides and reveals the statement jewelry worn.",5
"Weighs nothing. so comfortable. great length, not too short. fits a tad loose, but very pretty and easy to wear. fun print, flattering, casual style with a touch of class. 5'3 110lbs and the xs fits just as it shows on the model.",5
"After reading the reviews i sized down to a 6. once i received it, i loved the fabric and color, however it was so ill-fitting. it's like the designer didn't even use female measurements and used a box to make this top--too wide. i liked it so much that i sized way down to a 0 and it still fit horribly. it is too wide and not long enough. both are going back!",1
I had this on my wish list as soon as it came in. i just bought it last week and i'm so glad i did. i bought the purple print and it is really pretty. here in northern cal i can wear this almost year round. i am often right between sizes when it comes to deletta tops. this one is a little bit big i'm hoping that the extra room will help keep it cool during our 100 degree days.,5
"I bought the purple motif in size medium, my regular retailer size. the fit is true to size. the knit is soft and comfortable. this top can be dressed up or worn casually. it is a great all-around basic top for summer.",5
"This shirt dress has the right amount of body skimming drape and length to flatter my short potbellied square waisted self, i wish they made more versions more colors more sleeves!",5
I can wear this top with jeans or a business suit. the cowl neck is the best part. it gives this garment a little pop. yesterday i combined it with a black business suit and white pearls. i had so many compliments!,5
"I ordered my usual size s in the purple print. this peplum top style, colors/pattern will go easily with pretty much anything.. shorts, pants, jeans & skirts. wear for casual or dress it up. for me the fit is tts. armholes provide good coverage & length is fine. the top has a bit of stretch & doesn't feel restrictive. the waist is banded & a little loose which is fine. don't like tight fitting waists on tops. i like that the waist seems a little lower than other peplum tops at retailer. the skirt",5
"Love this tank! the purple motif is gorgeous, and the carbon color is a rich dark gray with a slight blue tinge. at 5'4"" / 130# with a fairly proportionate torso to leg ratio, i sometimes need a petite in tops like this to avoid the armholes being too long. in this top i found the petite small too short, but the regular small was perfect. the waist hits right above my natural waist, the hem is just a skosh lower than the model photo, and the armholes are the right length. beautiful flattering cu",5
"This dress is absolutely lovely. i couldn't leave the store without it, even though it was full price and i have a million dresses. it's just that great. i am 5' 8"" 130 lbs and bought the small",5
This shirt has it all. great staple piece to add to your wardrobe. not only is it classy with a pair of black pants and booties but you can add a little spice to it by dressing it up with some funky earrings. found it to be a bit large in the armpit area so i sized down.,5
"I love this feminine blouse and the gorgeous colors on! it's a fresh shape that is truly flattering. i like that it comes in specific sizes so the proportions seem accurate. i bought the 8 in peach; all the colors are very pretty. i am a usual 8/medium and am 34f, so the regular bra-friendliness is essential. this is a new, fuller shape for me. i'm on a quest at this time of year for clothing that feels comfortable in the beginning heat of summer, and this is a lovely choice. you could pair it w",5
This shirt is a steal at the sale price. i've received many compliments. it is a swing top- so not a lot of form. i wear a cami underneath & have found the style to be comfortable for work.,5
"Like the other reviewer said, the print is more beautiful in person. i am usually a small in meadow rue, and this fits well in a small. my only issue is that the lining hangs out from the bottom, and hangs out unevenly! hopefully i can exchange it or get it sewed up evenly.",5
This top is super flattering and comfortable. perfect summer wear!,5
"This cute top is made in the usa- yay! it is a flattering cut and looks great under jackets. i prefer the ivory color and feel of the fabric. the black and white was cute, but hung strangely and felt stiff. i am size sm/med, 34c and went with the small. cowl is cozy and can be styled to keep you warm.",5
"Perfect! very pretty and flattering without being too fussy. helps to hide my tummy and very well made. that said i have fairly wide shoulders and a larger ribcage so i had to size up considerably. usually a 4 or a 6 and i needed a 10 to be comfortable. the 8 went on but the fabric has no give so i sized up. i am never a 10 but that's what worked in this blouse. surprisingly it still looked nice and tailored. definately runs on the smaller side.

lovely. worth the full price in my opinion.",5
"This skirt is so light and breezy perfect for hot or humid weather. the first time i wore it i got compliments all day long. the length is perfect for a more conservative look, i don't wear mini skirts and the slit on the side shows just the right amount of leg. it runs a bit large so i had to go down a size.",5
"I love this blouse. it's really pretty and very flattering. it makes your waist look small. i usually wear a size 6 or 8. after reading the reviews saying it ran small, i ordered an 8 and a 10. the 10 fit perfectly, so i didn't even try the 8 on. it is a little difficult to get on and off due to the zipper on the side. that is my only complaint.",5
Beautiful airy well made blouse. very flattering and feminine. i normally wear a size 8 and ordered a 10 per the other reviews and i am glad i did! the fit id perfect.,5
"Very flattering and love style, print and color. i sized up one size and perfect fit. great with page grey wash skinny mid rise jeans.",5
"I'm not typically a fan of pilcro pants compared to paige or other brands like j brand, however, these simple black skinny jeans were just what i was looking for. they hit perfectly at the ankle and look great with a bootie. they are quite stretchy and i like my black jeans truly like a legging, so i sized down 1.5 sizes. i'm typically between a 30 and 31 and i purchased a 29 in these. initially they were snug around the waist but eased with wear. the material is flexible yet sturdy.",5
"This top is lovely; great colors for spring, light material, flow-y, and the cinching below the bust line creates a super flattering silhouette. i did have to size up to a 2 (i'm almost always a 0) to make some room for the girls (i'm a 32 c/d depending on the brand), so larger chested women may want to size up, but it's well worth it",5
"This blouse is romantic and timeless. the tonal print is lovely, the peplum cut flattering. i followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered one size up, which fits perfectly. it has a hidden side zip to make for easier off and on. i love the mix of cotton and silk which makes it breathable and lightweight. thank you, retailer, for finally making a blouse with natural fabrics that do not need a cami underneath! perfect for warm climates.",5
"I used to be a solid ""2"" then had to move down to 0 and 00... #i am 5'1.5"" and 115 lbs#, in this definitely a 2. the tighter part in the fitted waist is why i recommend peiople sizing ""up"" #if you are between sizes, choose bigger, teh cutis so flattering, it wont matter#.
the colros are really pretty, the flow of the shirt is romantic, sleeves are forgivin can't go wrong. hte back is a little longer, and covers the tushy. i can see this with flared bottoms, or pencil skirt or skiny jeans, even",5
"I love this top - it has the pattern and detailing that i feel like retailer used to do consistently, but often skimps on now. tit definitely runs small - i usually wear a 6 in retailer tops (sometimes a 4) and the 8 is quite fitted on me.",5
"I bought this t-shirt in pink, blue, red, grey and black over the past year. every one of them except the grey, has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline. i've returned them all. the fabric is thin and the quality of the t/shirt is terrible.",1
"This is a gorgeous blouse, but it runs small in my opinion. i consistently wear a size 2 in moulinette soeurs, and i'm trying to decide if a 4 will still be too small, and if i need to exchange for a 6. construction and materials are lovely, just consider sizing up if you purchase this blouse.",5
"Based on the two reviews on this skirt and, for the sale price i purchased the small--i 'm usually a large/extra large. i carry my weight in the middle, and this skirt stills works. very sofisticated striping, slimming! i haven't experienced any slipping, but i haven't worn it for any great length of time yet. there are numerous ways to create chic looks.",5
"Beautiful top but runs very small. based on some of the reviews that i read i ordered two sizes up from my usual size and it is still a little tight in the chest and around the ribs. i would like to exchange for the next size up but it is sold out in that size. considering how small this blouse runs it would have been nice if retailer had ordered some extra tops in larger sizes as i am sure that many people will have to size up. regardless, i love the blouse and would definitely recommend it to an",5
This top is adorable! runs a bit small but so cute worth the price and tons of compliments!!!!,5
This blouse is very beautiful and flattering. it's just a little bit see through so i will wear a cami underneath. as with sizing i did size up as the other commenters recommended to do so.,5
I purchased this blouse for an easter brunch and couldn't be happier! the feminine/romantic print is a gorgeous addition to my spring wardrobe. i've paired it with a pencil skirt and heels for a dressier look as well as my favorite ag cuffed denim and sandals for a more casual daytime look.,5
Light and airy. runs really small. had to go up 2 sizes. a little pricy but overall a cute blouse. not your typical blouse.,5
"This top is very pretty and figure-flattering because of the way it nips in under the bust. the neckline and color are also flattering. however, it runs a bit small and you need to get the right fit for the bust, balancing the band under the bustline with the roominess of the chest area. there is a side zipper but it can still be a little tricky to get on and off. i wound up not buying it due to the price, but i'd probably snap it on sale.",5
"Beautiful,delicate and unique cotton blouse that accentuates the waist and falls nicely down the belly. i love the floral print, very appropriate for spring/summer. i agree with the other reviewers who've mentioned that it runs small. i have a bust size of 34 dd and waist size 25 and i had to size up to 12. nevertheless, i am really looking forward to wearing this with a pair of skinny jeans and some nude pumps for a girls night out.",5
"Oh my goodness, i paid full price for this dress because i loved it so much. i styled it with a cream lace poncho , also from retailer, and it is gorgeous. at the sale price, you can't lose.",5
This jacket is really cute. i tried in in a large in the store and was too big so i took a chance and ordered medium on line. i have broad shoulders so i was a bit worried. it's perfect. very fitted and cropped. but will look great to throw on over a dress. for reference i'm 5 foot 6 inches and a 34 c. 132lbs. slender but athletic. medium was perfect.,5
"What a beautiful harbinger of spring! this blouse is so lovely and uplifting. for me, tts. i bought the size 4 (34-b) and it fits perfectly. this is a fitted blouse especially in the waistline so, i understand why some say size up. the print is pretty with muted shades of pinks and burgundies. the detailing of beige lace and the tiny buttons on the waist adds a very feminine touch along with the added interest on the back of the blouse. the fabric is soft but not overly sheer.",5
"I love this blouse! it's very flattering- gives the illusion of an hourglass shape. the fabric feels soft and flowy, and the pattern is pretty; it does need a camisole underneath because it's kinda sheer. it does run small! i usually wear a size 0 in retailer clothes, but i bought a size 2 in this shirt and the sleeves are still very snug around my forearms which is unusual for me.",5
"This dress is probably the most comfortable dress i've ever had! the fabric is very comfortable and breathable, and it flatters my straight body type.",5
"Very feminine and romantic blouse, i love it. it runs small as other reviewer said. i had to go 3 size up, as i want to wear a cami under it. the fabric is soft and sheer. the design emphasizes the nature curve of a woman's body, in a good way. back is longer than the front part. if you like romantic, floral prints and soft fabric, this one is a winner,",5
Love this top! but unfortunately i returned it for exchange coz it was too small for me. hoping there's a sz sm in stock.,1
"This is a very pretty blouse. the fabric is lightweight and very soft. i read the other reviews and this does run very small, i ordered two sizes larger than i normally would and it fits very nicely.",5
"I was hesitent to order this, was worried it would be too shapeless. i'm glad i ordered it as it is light and flowy though not so much that it makes you look like a shapeless tent. the colors are vibrant and the smooth fabric feels good against your skin. it is lined. i had no issues with the bust (i'm 38c). i wish it were an inch longer (i'm 5'9).",5
"I love this denim jacket! it's just a basic light denim jacket with a casual, pre-worn, soft feel. i like how it's slightly cropped. i think it runs fairly true-to-size, possibly a little on the small side. i am 5'6,"" 125 lbs., and 34c and i ordered a medium for a more relaxed fit. if i had wanted the fit shown on the model, i would have ordered a small ? but i prefer jackets to be a bit looser. i love it!",5
"I love it! the fit is very flattering. i read in another review that the top runs small, so i got a small instead of an extra small and it fits perfectly.",5
"I bought the black leggings and love how warm and comfy they are. i wore them with a tunic and boots to work, and people were surprised that they were leggings. the ribbing makes them nicer than plain black leggings. i want another pair, especially for the price!",5
"This dress was gifted to me and is a perfect compliment to the holidays. i can't wait to wear it! the bottom portions shines (i am a devoted lover of all things sparkle and shine) but it really stands out with the darker background. the pleats hide imperfections in body shape and would make a flattering dress on most figures. i also like that the top layer extends below the bottom one, leaving little extra sheer to tastefully show more leg.",5
"I love this skirt! as a fan of different textures and pretty things, this piece exceeded my expectations! i am always a size 0 or 2 in retailer dresses and the 2 fits like a glove. the length is perfect - just above the knee. ever since i wore a valentino dress with a similar thick, neoprene material, i've adored the feel of it! everything feels firm and put together. the colors in this skirt are beautiful and the pattern is feminine and romantic. it will pair well with lots of different tops too!",5
"This dress is just so beautiful. i purchased the teal with beading at the hem. the beading is subtle and beautiful. i'm wearing this do a spring wedding, even though i believe it would be best in cooler months. i so wanted the plum option with the flower aplique at the hem - wouldn't that be perfect for the spring wedding - but all gone!
note - the teal with the beading - the beading weighs a bit, enhancing the lines of the dress - doesn't stick out, doesn't make you look like your wearing a dr",5
Does not say ribbed. did not want ribbed. would not have bought ribbed,1
Beautiful dress. the dress appears more blue in the picture- it is actually green. made well- i love it!,5
"These leggings are so warm and comfortable. they're thick enough to wear as pants, and they don't stretch and slide during the day. i wish they came in more colors!",5
"I'm a sucker for beaded detailing, so i couldn't resist this blouse. it's so beautiful and fun! i can't wait to wear it!",5
"Love this top..got it in both orange and white and always get compliments, especially on the orange color - beautiful and vibrant color! very comfy top and washes well with no problems. the style does swing but not too huge.",5
"I'm about 130 lbs. and 6' tall and usually a small would be my size. these fit, but i would be more comfy in a m. they are stretchy, soft and opaque. perfect for under a couple sweater dresses i picked up by retailer!!! will be re-ordering.",5
"I really love these leggings. the different textures that all the colors have make them interesting. quality is great. i am 5 1"" and 125lbs. the s/m fit pretty well but i wish there was a xs option. but still would not hesitate to buy again!! i actually went to retailer tonight to purchase all the other colors,...that's how happy i am with this purchase!",5
"$20 for super comfy, warm leggings. bought two pairs for myself and another pair for my mother. let's be honest, i'll probably be buying another pair.",5
"Love these leggings!!! soft, cozy and yummy feeling! can't wait for the weather to get cooler! these fleece-lined leggings will be a new staple this winter!!!",5
I bought this to wear to and english garden themed party and i loved it for this event. it is very bright maybe even more than the pictures if that's possible and the skirt is was long on my 5'4 frame so i had to get it it hemmed several inches so that it didn't give the 50's housewife look. it was comfortable and i the skirt had just enough poof to make me feel great. i could wear a regular bra but not sure where else i'm going to wear this but i'm going to try to come find another event worthy,5
"These are the best leggings i have ever worn - and i wear a lot of leggings. i am 5' 8"" tall and 127lbs. i bought a s/m. they very soft and warm. they stay up perfectly, and do not pinch or make any lines. i am amazed that they are so inexpensive. i am buying 2 more after this review!",5
I purchased this dress for a black tie optional wedding in the mansions of rhode island. it was comfortable and appropriate. i received so many compliments from strangers. wonderfully twirling dress for dancing too!,5
I love this dress. even more beautiful in person ??,5
These leggings are awesome quality especially for the price. they are warm and form fitting. they are thick and the design is nice. i plan on wearing them all winter!,5
"These leggings are amazing. by far one of the most comfortable pairs that i own! i should have ordered more. i got a m/l and they fit perfect. the detailing is awesome, and they even stay opaque when you sit, so you don't have to worry about them being see-through. great buy!",5
"I love this skirt! i wasn't sure about the mix of the back pattern with the front but it works! it is great for work at a less conservative place and for dinners out too! the quality is great - the skirt is a fine silk, ant it is lined, so you don't need a slip. i think it fits perfectly for my body type, and while it runs big compared to typical retailer sizing, it is true to size compared to other stores in the petite sizes anyway. i am normally a 0 petite, 5'2"", 104, waist 24.5"", hips 34",5
"This skirt looks and feels cheap, and the color is much more green than pictured. additionally, i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds, and this is still way too tight to be flattering.",1
Super itchy! had to return.,1
"I never buy prints.....but this was so understated and elegant i could not resist!
just received and it is lovely!
beautiful soft hues with the softest of pattern that will look fantastic with jeans.
the buttons are beautiful and a special touch!
will be wearing this top often........pretty, soft fabric, comfortable fit and a ""goes with everything and everywhere piece!""
a must get!
i wear a medium and ordered my usual size and it fits beautifully.
love!
reminds me of a monet watercolor..",5
"My husband rarely seems this pleased and he always likes to see what i try on. oohs and aaaahs galore with this one! let's let him review this one....he says he loves the vibrant color, length, and the way the top is perfectly fitted. he was impressed with the lining and the ""mesh"" at the hem that keeps the 'flare' in the skirt (i had to explain that one)! he likes the way it looks with a sweater and without and said that i could use more than one of the many pairs of shoes with it that he sees",5
These are the best leggings! they were so comfortable that i wore them all day and then to bed; i didn't want to take them off. i'm hoping to get a few more pairs.,5
I have these in grey and i love them! they are so comfy. i got them in m/l even though i am a s/m because i like the loose fit. they are very soft.,5
"So much to love about this dress! the color is exactly as pictured in the video, not photos. the fabric is substantial, beautiful colors. the dress is well constructed , back zipper and is easy to put on and take off. it is not only lined but has a crinoline built in to the liner! it's not super puffy, just enough to give it some flare. i am 36b, 5'8"", 155 lbs and bought a 10. it fits me perfectly! the shoulders are a smidge too big but not enough for me to have them taken up just yet. oh, and i",5
I needed a legging to wear with boots. makes sense that if it is cold enough to wear boots in socal then it is too cold to wear thin leggings. try to find warm leggings....almost impossible until retailer put fleece lined leggings in their catalogue! the leggings have a vertical knitted stripe which elongates the leg and they are warm! perfection in garments is very rare but these leggings are hot.,5
"These are great jeans and worth every penny. they hug every curve and have just enough give in the places that you need them. i find them to be very figure-flattering and dressed them up with high heeled boots and a nice blouse. even though i'm petite, i ordered a regular in my size (26) because i wanted the length of regular jeans as opposed to ankle length.",5
"Really comfortable, great for casual event or everyday wearing. best style with jeans.",5
Love the leggings. very soft and comfortable. i ordered two pair -one s/m and one m/l. the s/m fit better on me but both will work.,5
"These pants are so warm and cozy and comfortable. they are like cashmere for your legs...so amazingly soft!! and for that price, it's definitely worth getting all the colors!!",5
"I wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm. they get the job done and for an incredible price. they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside. i'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it's subtle and i don't mind it. they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots, the length not a problem. my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg. retailer kindly sent me a new pair for",5
Love how these fit! they are warm and such a good price! i got 3 pairs. i washed mine in a garment bag and it washed just fine. i hung them dry.,5
"Truly the only word that comes to mind when i think of this dress is dazzling! the pictures online just barely do it justice...if you have an retailer nearby, check to see if its available in store and go check it out in person. it does not disappoint! every year around this time, our beloved retailer seems to come out with this style of dress. in the years past they have all been different and beautiful, but i think they have truly outdone themselves this year. this dress is a deep emerald green...",5
Really comfortable leggings! not see through and at a great price!,5
"These are my new favorite leggings. they have everything i need - soft waist band that doesn't squeeze me at all, not overly long, subtle ribbed texture (black pair) that make them feel just a little nicer, and most importantly they are not see thru at all. so soft on the inside too. and this price is nuts too, i'm so happy with these!",5
"I bought this in the green and i had to try a few to get one that sat well- in fact i tried on a size above my normal size and that particular dress was shorter and tighter than my normal size. when i reordered my normal size, it was a pretty good fit. i kept the dress but am still on the fence on whether or not i should actually keep it- it took so long to find one that fit well that it missed the holiday events where i'd hoped to wear it.",5
"These leggings are a quality product at a great price! i ordered these for my daughter and she loves them. warm and comfy, she wears them all the time.",5
These are super comfy and a great fitting everyday short. the embroidery gives them a nice touch. i am ordering another pair!,5
"I've worn this dress to two summer weddings and i couldn't be happier with it. this dress is extremely flattering. i usually wear a size 12, but i returned the dress for a size 10 which fit perfectly. the exact same dress, but in a different color was being sold at another major store. the other color wasn't nearly as flattering (but still cute) and the price was comparable.",5
I bought this dress in the store and realized that it was a little too long for my frame...i'm 5'1. i then found it online in the same size but in petite and it fits perfectly! i got a ton of compliments and i wore it to a holiday wedding and am planning on wearing it to several other occasions over the holidays. would def recommend this dress.,5
"I couldn't believe the bargain price of these leggings, so i took a chance and ordered all 3 colors. when they arrived, i was equally pleased to see how soft, cozy and warm they were and how nice they looked with all my oversized tops. also interesting is that the textures of all 3 are different. the black has a vertical lined texture, the lavender has a cable weave texture and the gray is untextured. wearing them is going to be a pleasure!",5
"Loved this dress. fit like a glove, so flattering, and perfect for a summer/fall wedding. material is substantial and dress is well made. i'm 5'4, large chest, and curvy, and a size 6 fit perfectly. longer than seen on the model for me, but i actually love it being tea-length. 

a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it ""poof."" i removed it, but looks good either way.",5
"From quality, to design, and overall comfort...these leggings have it all. they are so so soft and feel and look amazing on. i bought the black and i love the ribbed detailing. it's just enough to add a little something. i ended up buying the other two colors and another pair of black! for the price it's more than worth it.",5
"Just got this top in the mail today, and i love it. i bought the white in a small, and it fits as pictured on the model. the fabric says it's cotton, but it's a substantial fabric and feels as soft as silk. the bodice is lined, so no bra lines show through. the tiered part of the tank is not lined but is not really sheer or see-through. the arm holes are not too large, as sometimes happens on me when i wear sleeveless tops. i think i'll be wearing this one a lot this summer, and a lot of summers",5
"I normally stay away from dresses like these because they have a tendency to make my tall, hourglass frame look like i had one too many burgers. however, i saw one left in the store and was drawn in by it's color and beautiful sequins. my thoughts below:

pros:
- exactly as pictured. i got the purple option, but i did see another lady grab the green. both are beautiful in different ways.
- like another mentioned, the sequins on the bottoms gives some weight to the dress, but in a g",5
"I love this skirt. it does run a little small, i ordered an extra small and it is tight at the waist, but still works. i have received more compliments on this skirt than maybe anything i have owned. i've been stopped at the grocery store by people telling me how much they like it. i also work with kids, and they all love it as well.",5
"This top is beautiful in design, but sadly, i will be returning. it is hand wash, and even after doing so, i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes. unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing.",1
These are fabulous leggings for cold days. i am a teacher who has to do crossing guard duty in the mornings and finally i have something stylish that also keeps me warm! love them and i highly recommend. only con is that they are about 1/2 of an inch shorter than i would like.,5
"So soft, comfortable and warm! i ordered the black and think i'll buy the grey and lavender, as well. the material is a little synthetic/almost shiny looking, but definitely not a deal breaker. these are my new lounge pants. recommend!",5
I bought the black and gray fleece lined leggings. i thought the price was great. too good to be true. you get what you pay for. once i opened the box they smelled awful. it was a chemical smell. i washed the black pair twice and it was a little better. i have washed the gray 5 times and it still smells.,1
I get so many compliments when i wear this... colors are great and print is unique. perfect for fall.,5
This dress fits to a t! true to size. very flattering. fabric is soft and comfortable.,5
"This dress is absolutely gorgeous. every time i wear it, people just don't stop admiring it. great material and great fit.",5
I couldn't even figure out how to wear this sweater the fit was so odd. the arms cut off short and the seams don't hit your shoulders where they should. all the extra fabric around the collar is just confusing and unflattering. moving around in it was not easy. i will return this one!,1
"I loved this top but it runs small so i had to send it back, unfortunately.
beautiful styling and color blocking. just wish there had been a larger size available to have been able to exchange for.",5
"I'm a 34c and 136 lbs. i bought this jacket in m and it fits perfect! the sleeves are just the right length, it fits through the chest and hips. the leather and other material is super soft! i love the dark brown color, it's just as pictured. like someone else said, you can tuck the hanging material inside the jacket for a sleeker look. this is my new favorite jacket!",5
"This jacket is stunning. the vegan leather has a slight shimmer. the waterfall fabric is nice and soft. it's really beautiful and unique. cropped jackets tend to shorten me, but the cascading waterfall fabric add a nice little bit of length that just balances the jacket nicely. the sleeves in the xxsp petite size that i tried on were tight. they were better in the xsp but i won't be wearing any thick sweaters underneath. it fit everywhere else. i'm usually an xxsp, and sized up for the arms. ove",5
"This jacket is phenomenal. the color is gorgeous in person. the brown has a unique shimmer to it that just makes it feminine and special. it's also very warm and comfortable. like some other reviewers said, it looked great zipped as well as unzipped. this is a really special find and great addition! if you're considering this jacket i say go for it. for reference, i actually love the fit and thought it was tts, though i am a 32c and got this in a small so perhaps that's only the case for c cup a",5
Was so excited to see that this colorful top came in petite sizes! it fits perfectly and so happy that it doesn't fall too long. looks great with a longer cardigan sweater. very happy with this find .,5
Loved the look of the sweater and the the fit was as shown.  however this is a thin cashmere for the price.  returned.,1
"I love the colors and pattern on this dress, and it's nice that it has a lining so no slip needed.  the cut works perfectly for my big booty figure however, i'm pretty small up top, and the neckline comes pretty low, so i either have to wear my craziest push-up bra, or get the top altered. i haven't decided what my plan is yet, but will keep the dress for sure.",5
"Love, love this top. fabric is nice and soft, looks great with leggings. love the way it falls in the front an long enough in the back.",5
"5'6 149lbs 34d normally size 6

i picked this up on a whim to try on and i am glad i did. it is very flattering on my curvy frame. it does run a big big so i sized down to a 4 instead of my normal size 6. the top is still a tad bit big as another commented- not enough that i would need to have it altered but enough that i probably wouldn't wear it to work without a cami under it. over all i love this dress. its very flattering and flirty and it makes me feel pretty! i bought the orange motif",5
"Love the skirt, colors are nice, fabric is thick enough to go to fall, but not too thick for summer (ti is short, so has room). the colors are somewhat ""brighter"" in person, but not summer bright, more fall bright, not sure htat makes sense). love the flower pattern, it is pretty but strong at the same time.

now on to fit: the waist is the small part. my usual 0 was snug on the waist, but the skirt was perfect everywhere else. not sure about sizing up yet, as it may flare out too much, will g",5
"I love this tank. super soft and comfy. i wear with leggings, jeans, shorts- anything. longer in the back so will cover your butt- at least it covered mine. runs slightly oversized. love the asymmetry in the front- very flattering. very happy with it.",5
"I am 5' 5"" 150 lb and i usually wear a 10 or 12 in tops because i don't like clothing too tight on top. i took a chance and got the xl because it was all that remained. now i wish i could be more! please bring this back retailer!",5
I saw this dress in the store window and gave it a try. i found it to be super flattering and feminine. the bodice is form fitting and the skirt flares out to a full skirt. the colors are fun and vibrant. the neckline is a bit low for work but perfect for evening. it is true to size.,5
"I bought this dress in the orange and it is great for summer. even though i am normally a small/size 4 at 5'5"" & 118 lbs, i opted for the 6 because i am busty (34d). this was the right call. the dress is comfortable, flattering and i got lots of compliments. it's a keeper!",5
The dress has an awesome fit and the perfect length. it's easy to make it more classy with a summer cardigan.,5
"I didn't notice what some of the other reviews have said. i think it's very flattering, makes my waist look tiny and the flouncy skirt is a lot of fun. it is low cut in the bust, but not crazy. i'm a modest person and i'm comfortable with it. what i like best however it the cut of the top. it is wide enough at the arms to cover any armpit bulge! the fabric is very light and soft and the colors are vibrant and fun. it does run a tad large. i can go between a 2 and 4 in most retailer dresses and got",5
As soon as i saw this skirt i was in love. i like the fit it is very comfortable. i love the detail in the crocheted part of the skirt. i can't wait to wear it and i recommend this item.,5
"Everyone else who reviewed felt the dress fit quite odd.  i have an oddly shaped body, so this dress was perfect on me!  the bigger bodice fit on my large broad rounded upper body, skimmed my true waist and flared out to complimentary skirt that wasn't too twee.  the silhouette evens out my odd figure.  the fabric is a gorgeous pink/orange/teal pattern on comfortable cotton.  i do have to agree with the lowness of the neckline, it's a bit immodest.  i wear my cropped denim jacket and a simple la",5
"This skirt is worth every penny! it appears slightly different than pictured in terms of color -- it is a cream/blue gray making it very versatile. the crochet work is beautiful and cream. it is not too bright to show every dirt mark; the cream coordinates perfectly with the leather color. it is a classic, elegant design and could be paired with a silk type or even a cashmere sweater in the cooler months to come. for me, it is tts mostly (i am usually a 4-6) and the six fits perfectly. it has an",5
These are the best tights! last year i bought these and they went back to regular waistband. this year the best waistband tights are best!,5
The color of these shorts is even more beautiful and vibrant in real life. the detail is wonderful and they are so comfortable!,5
I saw this initially in the store and thought it was nice but did not purchase because i thought the price was too high.  i saw it again and it was on sale but the store had sold out of my size.  i checked online and my size was available so i ordered.  i was afraid this cape would be to long and make me look frumpy but it wasn't and i didn't.  it looked great. i tie the belt a little higher than the model to make me look taller.   i can't wait to wear it on cool fall days.,5
"This is a very lovely sweater dress, it looks just as pictured and true to size. i ordered mine online and was very happy with this purchase. the material of the top white portion is very soft and cozy and bottom peach chiffon material has sparkly stones. sweater dress is very pleasant on the skin and looks refreshing. recommend!",5
"I love the colors and style of this poncho, however, the fabric is a total miss.  it is so scratchy, i developed a serious rash within the first 1/2 hour of wering it. also, unfortunately, the fabric is not woven tightly, so the poncho does not keep you warm, the wind whips right through it. it is disappointing that while the styles of retailer have remained top, the quality of their clothing has steadly gone down the hill. i hope retailer will put more effort in bringing the quality back.",1
"This blouse is stunning on the website ;however, it is totally sheer which you cannot tell from the photo. i was very disappointed and will be returning.",1
Very comfortable and love the color. i'm a bit curvier on the bottom and the small still fit me fine.,5
The jeans are the perfect high-waisted jeans. they do not stretch out and fit perfectly. the perfect length for a heel. love them all year round.,5
"When i saw this sweater online i ordered literally immediately as i was afraid that is would sell withing an hour!
i am shocked that it is not sold out!
when i received it in the mail it is even prettier in person.
the ""pink"" tulle peplum is actually more of a taupe giving the sweater a more sophisticated look.
the sweater is soft and cozy and the peplum is such a beautiful and elegant touch.
i wore with silver flats and jeans and wow, got so many compliments!
runs spot on true to size and is a",5
"I got this in the grey and wore it the day i opened the package. one side is see through, so i wore a camisole underneath. it's lightweight and not at all clingy. i normally like my shirts in medium and this was true to size for me. perfect sweater for a fall day in new england.",5
"I've been trying to find a pair of tasteful destroyed jeans for the summer. i'm also petite. i love paige jeans already, since the ankle length has worked very well on me. i saw these jeans in store, tried them on, and loved them. like other paige jeans they don't stretch out (especially if you size down - but even then, you don't get that ""sausage"" feeling of wearing pants that are too small - the material stretches in the waste).",5
"Love these! i am a medium in shorts or 29-30, and the medium fit perfectly.. true to size, very soft, flattering cut and color. love the embroidery. great for travel, very light and can be jazzed up a little with nice sandals, almost like a flirty little short skirt. the fullness and non fitted look is great for a less than perfect tummy.
i am very happy with this purchase.",5
"Really cute and comfortable. i have worn these a couple of times and get several compliments! worth every penny, and now they are on sale!",5
"I am 5'3"", 130b, small waist, wide hips. dress fits perfectly, a little longer than i had expected (hits about mid-calf on me). great quality corduroy, nice medium green color. very unique, sort of vintage feel piece.",5
This poncho is dreamy. the colors are divine and appear a little bolder in person. there is a gorgeous leather trim around the edges that elevates the look so much. the belt minimizes how big the poncho is and really makes it feminine. its everything you dream of when it comes to a third layer for fall. my only gripe is that the fabric is a little itchy. it being wool i can't say that i'm surprised and the truth is that its heavy enough that you would definitely be wearing long sleeves underneat,5
"Unlike one comment below a review on here who stated it felt childish, i didn't feel this way at all. i'm a sucker for anything white with tulle and soft colors and a bit of bling :) here's my thoughts:
-------------------------
pros:
- very soft with good amount of stretch.
- tulle bottom is exactly as pictured. i disagree with another reviewer who said the color was more of taupe; it is not. this is pink/nude shade all the way.
- runs tts. i'm a 36c, hourglass, 5'9"" and found the medium to be",5
"These shorts are great for warm weather. they look great with a navy top. the pattern is very attractive. they are on the baggy side, but the style is very flattering.",5
"I love the texture and sheen of corduroy combined with this beautiful evergreen color. i purchased size 10 and the somewhat stretchy fit accommodates my bust size (36dd) with a blouse or slim fitting sweater quite well. i think the skirt flares out too much and ends a little too low for my height, so i'm waiting for the petite to arrive to see if it's more flattering. i picked tts but may be a bit large for those who are less busty, so you may want to size down if you're slender or pear shaped.",5
I tried it in the store but was not the true size so i ordered online. i wore it only once so far and got lots of compliments. very unique design.,5
"This is so much nicer in person! wore this out today...now that it isn't too too cold. fashionable and warm. love the clasp. quite genius! i am a 36c and while i'd normally take a small, got this in medium and it fits perfectly. i'd say this piece runs slightly small for retailer.",5
"I loved this dress. i'm 5'6"" and wore the small and even in heels it was a bit long. i have a larger chest (double d) and the chest was slightly snug but otherwise fit perfectly.  i got compliments from everyone, gorgeous dress.",5
"This dress is incredible! let me say that when it first arrived, i was terrified that i looked like a got tangled in my grandma's curtain. the print was really overwhelming for my living room. however, i went with my gut and wore this dress for our engagement photos out in the woods. not only was in incredibly flattering, it photographed better than i could have imagined. wouldn't recommend wearing this grocery shopping but this is a perfect for a special occasion!",5
"I tried this on, left, went back, put it on hold, then finally took the plunge. i had a hard time justifying the price. not really a functional coat, too warm to be a shirt. but so unique, i had to have it!! i got the s/m. boxy, in a good way. got it yesterday with the antro members 20% off.",5
"I love this shimmer tank-in both colors! it is a very thin fabric-thinner than i would have expected, but i think this is okay since i would use it for layering and probably never wear it as a standalone tank. i think you can never go wrong with sparkles, especially in a layering tank-it dresses up or fancies up the outfit. the straps on this tank are not adjustable, and if you are large chested, i think a lot of cleavage would show in this tank. i would have preferred the sleeves are very sligh",5
I was hesitant to buy this due to the price but so i glad i did when it came in the mail. great quality and surprisingly thick silky fabric. very comfortable and the shimmery thread detail is beautiful. could be very warm in the summer due to the thick tweed like fabric. fits and looks true to size just like it does on the model.,5
"I adore this top. lovely color, fit is very flattering. can dress up for work with a skirt, or down with jeans.",5
I purchased this in both colors the neutral and grey. i love them both but the grey is by far my fave. this is a nice soft beautiful tee. the burst of flowers are just adorable. i found these ran tts on me. cute little top and such a good deal at sale price.,5
"Nice quality fabric that's soft to the touch, lightweight, and lays smoothly. runs small - great for those of us who are small on top! the s fits like xs. longer length but not tunic length. the navy can pass for dark silver-gray.",5
"Vibrant, lovely and quite long! this maxi works for leggy bettys - i stand 5'11"" in my stocking feet, and the dress hem grazed the floor. not quite as voluminous as the photo suggests, but stunning nonetheless. runs a bit small. i normally wear xs to s, and i tried a xs in-store, but it fit just ever-so-slightly too snug. i didn't try a size s, but i suspect it may have fit ever-so-slightly too large.",5
"In love with this dress! so feminine and lovely. makes you feel beautiful. the fabric, flow, and construction of this dress is stunning and flattering. i am 5ft2in and 114 lbs...bought the xs and it fit perfectly in the waist but is a bit snug in my not so large bust area.  however, the s was too large and did nothing to accentuate my waist and changed the whole look of the dress on me. cannot wait to wear this dress, but it is so long &needs to be altered. itll be worth it!",5
"These pants are wonderful. they are very flattering, the color is gorgeous, and they are incredibly comfortable. got tons of complements!",5
I got fooled by this dress's description. it's 100% polyester and not wool as it claims to be! looks cheap.returned it!,1
Gorgeous soft colors that can be worn with many things. lightweight fabric with beautiful detailed finish to the neckline. i purchased at my local retailer store along with the baroque tee (that i purchased in a smaller size because of the differences in the design of the two shirts). highly recommend both!,5
"This seems like a simple tank, but the shape of it is super flattering. it kind of soles in at the seam, and the shoulders are just adorable and sexy at the same time. i love the detail in the straps, coloring is neutral enough, adn the fabric is very soft... i am glad i finally tried it on, jsut didn't want t pay full price, but broke down as sizes are selling out (smaller sizes, i am usually xs petite and that is gone, so is xxs, so went with xs). i am 115 lbs and 30dd for reference...",5
"Flattering cut, the tie neck is very nice, but definitely needed the petite for me, regualr size went too low. the striping is a nice flowey thin fabric in grey and navy, with a bit of texture in ti, not sure it is obvious from the picture. length in eptite went right below my knee, but in a goood spot. overall, loved it, but returned in hopes it hits sales one day (jsut spending too much latetly)...",5
Far more attractive in person than online. earlier reviews are all accurate. very flattering and quality manufacturing. the scarf bow makes it so distinctive.,5
"Beautiful tee and cut with a classic, simple silhouette. nice weight and true to size. i'm 5'7"", 132# and the small fits me like i like. not tight at all, with room to allow for shrinkage. i really appreciate the higher cut of the neck as most tees i have purchased last several years i love for the overall fit and material but am a little self-conscious in due to the low cut neck. maybe if i weren't as small chested this wouldn't be an issue for me. i definitely recommend this tee.",5
"This is just a really fun jacket. agreed with the previous reviewer that it's not the most functional. but guess what -- this is super cozy (it's lined with the softest faux fur), it's quilted in an army green, and it has the best trim along the arm. they could've cut corners on the quality here, for instance, with the beading or the material on the trim. however, they didn't cut those corners. instead, the jacket feels incredibly well made and feels very expensive. can't wait till the weather g",5
I wanted to love this but my hips interfered. it is a little on the short side also as one previous reviewer noted and is definitely made for a straight figure. beautiful details on the shoulder and could definitely see this as a staple in my closet if the fit was right. sadly it was returned!,5
"I really try to avoid hand washing so i immediately checked the label when i found this dress in-store. and despite the fact that retailer lists this as hand wash online, the label says machine wash. (it also says lay flat to dry.) so i was happy about that. i tried this in xs regular (first photo with camisole) which was too low-cut and then ordered the xspetite in the second photo (i'm a 34aa, ~105 lbs.) which was better; higher v-neck mainly and shorter length, although i could've gone with eit",5
These are so comfortable! i love how they fit snug but have tons of stretch..this is my second pair of fleetwood from coh. love this style,5
"What a fabulous find! i purchased the grey and it looks great with different shades of blue jeans. i am 5'9"" 136lbs and wear a size 6..... 34 c and the medium fits wonderful. was worried it would run short, as i am long waisted, but fits just a bit shorted then pictured. i love tucking the front in and letting the back hang out.",5
"Very cute skort that fits tts. great length for us middle aged women as well! love the hidden front pockets and the modern color block design. my only issue is the side zipper gets stuck right where the waistband starts. i'm assuming this is because of the thicker fabric around the waistband. i usually try to wait for the sale prices, but i think this skort will sell out well before then.",5
"I'm 5'2-5'3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer (former employee) and while the bodice hit right, the skirt was insanely long. not even with heels is this gonna be right. and no discount towards hemming? i'll wait until this hits the sale rack, which it will because concensus is, it's way too long.",1
"Was actually looking for something completely different and then walked into this dress. i have already a few events lining up for the summer months, and i could see this working on those hot summer days. i'm short and curvy so i tried on the large in store (i'm busty) and ended up ordering the petite l online. the top part fits proportion wise better with petite while a l gives my larger bust size enough room. i love the 3/4 length, i feel a great length when you're only 5'1, will look great wi",5
I love this tee so much i bought in every color available. i have received so many compliments on each one! so soft and comfortable and easy care.,5
"I love this piece and have bought it for three different clients as well as myself... it runs a size larger - i am usually a 4 and the 2 fits perfectly. the skort was one size off for my clients too. definitely a great choice for spring/summer, especially if you love to dress up but lead an active lifestyle!",5
It's the inverted invert ... not so obvious at first but then it shrunk and was harder to ingnore.,1
"Love the dress. it's beautiful and flowy and makes you feel like a princess when you wear it. also very versatile, as it can be worn in multiple seasons and dressed up or dressed down. love everything about the dress and know that it will become a staple in my closet. runs true to size- xs = 0/2 and s = 2/4. if you are short, be prepared to have the hem taken up. 

worth the buy!",5
"I love this top! i purchased the gray simply because i felt it would go with more. i can pair it with blue jeans, my pink pilcro chinos, and even my turquoise pilcro shorts. i love that this tee doesn't have the rolled sleeves, so it's a little more finished looking. i tried on both the small and medium and both fit, but i preferred the tapered fit of the small and ultimately went with that. for reference, i'm 5'8"", 140 lbs, 32d chest. i do think $58 is hefty for a t-shirt, so you could roll the",5
"Love this dress so so much! the wearability of it isn't much since it's such a ""wow!"" dress, but if you have a wedding that it would be fitting for, itso perfect. if it were a touch shorter i'd be happy wearing it to the park. i'd suggest hemming if you want to make it more casual buy why go there when it's so stunning long. the sales associates in store kept telling me i looked like a princess ( although that may have been my doing as i kept twirling for them saying "" look how cool this is!"") .",5
I love this dress! it is so much fun to wear to the beach or out to lunch! the arm holes are a little large so i wear s tank underneath!,5
"Super soft, cap sleeves, shirt tail hem and double stitched seams. mine is the grey/green motif and tts. i bought (s) 34-b and the fit was perfect. the tee can transition into fall as i feel it has a more fall appeal over summer because of the grey/green motif. the blue/pink motif feels more like summer.",5
"I was hesitant to purchase since this price is expensive for a tank, but the quality and true shimmery-ness are worth it. it fits very well and goes with many different sweaters. very happy with my purchase!",5
"I ordered two sizes up, after reading reviews and added a belt for waist definition. it is long...i am six feet tall and it is perfect for me. this is absolutely beautiful; my husband loves the floral print, and i received countless compliments after one wear. the light, flowing material swayed and billowed in the breeze of the outdoor wedding i attended. very feminine and enjoyable to wear. pricey, but i felt i could wear spring through autumn. love! <3",5
Wore these to church and stayed cool without being scandy. i havent worn skorts since the 90s and this was such a nice return to that trend. :-),5
"This is one of those pieces that are timeless, special and absolutely stunning. the body of the jacket is quilted, very boxy, and the embroidery and beading on the jacket is what makes it absolutely gorgeous. the inside of the jacket is this super soft incredible fleecy fur. it adds to the luxury of the jacket. in regard to fit, its very boxy. if you live near an retailer i would highly recommend popping in to try it on. i personally wish it was a smudge longer, but i think the detail and style of",5
"I have discovered that i'm really picky about t-shirts. it's hard to find a cute, flattering one that you can wear with whatever. this one is perfect. the neckline is different, the sleeves are short -- almost cap sleeves. it fits nicely everywhere. i am an 8/10 and the medium fit well. i love that it's a dark enough color and not sheer (why are so many of your clothes see through, retailer?!!!) , so i don't have to layer something under it just to wear it. it's thin enough that you can wear it in",5
"I love this dress. it is so flattering and comfortable! i am petite with curves, and feel so good when wearing this. i ordered a petite small. i will have to stop myself from wearing it every day this summer.",5
"Don't pass this one up ladies....the fabric is casual and relaxed, but the drawstring-like collar gives it class and flirt all at the same time. i paired it with a jersey mini skirt and the way the banding at the waist falls on this top made it look like one whole dress. i can wear this with cropped jeans, shorts, anything! truly a homerun. i'm 5'10"", 138lbs and small fit perfectly.",5
This dress makes me feel like the princess of fall. it is very slimming. the colors are much brighter in real life. they look pastel here but are more pronounced. love this dress!,5
"Love this dress! very flattering. material is thinner and more lightweight than i was imaging but it is great. it really does run small, like the other reviewers said -- glad i ordered one size up, fits perfectly!",5
"This is cuter in person than online. the scarf goes all the way around the neck and ties on the side as the halter. the whole top is soft like a t-shirt material. there is an elastic band at the bottom, but it's not too cinched so it won't cut into your waist- it just gives it a little bit of shape. it's a cute way to show off some shoulder this summer in a lightweight fabric. i'm looking forward to wearing it out at night with nice jeans or during the day outside. a good price for retailer",5
"Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico, but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.",1
I love this shirt so much that i bought it in both colors. i purchased the xs regular which fit perfectly. the material is incredibly soft yet thick enough that i know it has some durability. the neckline is very flattering and comes up higher than most tees but not so high that it feels constricting. i also love that it is slightly tapered and comes in towards your waist at the sides and is slightly longer in the back. it's an absolute staple in my wardrobe now.,5
"This dress is gorgeous. i bought it to wear to the ballet, and i know i will wear it to other formal events as well. it is really fancy---definitely wouldn't wear it to work! i had it hemmed as it was really long on me, and it is a bit tight in the shoulders. it has a beautiful shape and flows while you are walking---it felt pretty!",5
"I love skorts! so when i saw this online i ordered my usual size 6. arrived today & really cute. fit is good w/ some room to spare. almost too big but i'll stick w/ the 6. looks as in the pic except the lower front part & the back has a metallic sparkly fiber in the fabric. not shown in the pic though. it's understated but attractive. the fabric patches give this skort a special uniqueness. casual or a little dressy, just love... 5'3"", 117#.",5
"Love  this dress, beautiful!",5
"I really love this piece. it's so different from anything else i own! the material has a lot of fine details to it that are hard to see in the photos. easy to dress up with a bit of jewelry and heels. the only downside is the upper body fit. i'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs with more of an hourglass shape. i did not fill out the top at all, although the shorts fit fine around my waist.",5
"I love this dress, saw it online and went to try it on in the store the next day. this dress is perfect! the pattern stands out but isn't too overwhelming. i'm 5'4"" 120lbs and 32ddd i bought an xs and i love the fit. it's just the right amount of fabric to be flowy without being excessive. one thing i've found with flowy dresses is they make you look preggers if you have a large bust however this dress is nothing of the sort. seriously if you find your size in stock snatch it up!",5
"I'd been eyeing this skirt for quite some time so when it went in sale, i took the plunge! i hover between a size 12 and 14, though lately unfortunately it's usually a 14, haha! ;) the 14 fit true to size, perfect silhouette! i will say it was more of a midi length on me than as seen on the model and i'm a near 5' 9"" so for more petite girls the length might be tricky. for me, it was fine, i liked the slightly longer length, it made it even more elegant. the quality was superb, no missing thread",5
These shorts are so cute and comfortable! you can wear any color top and they are very flattering! they fit tts.,5
"I fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it. it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer, but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it didn't matter. i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days. this is one of my new favorites!",5
Really cute romper that can be dressed up or down. super comfortable and flattering. i ordered the xs and it fit perfect.,5
"This romper is one of my favorite purchases. the material is great, the fit is very forgiving, and it is very comfortable. it is easily dressed up or down. i purchased a size smaller than i usually wear and it fits well.",5
"After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful, but only for one use.",1
"I ordered the orange color online and was very happy with the product when it arrived. it's a soft orange color, perfect for fall. the shirt is thin and probably will need a cami underneath, but it's longer in the back than the front and will go great with leggings or skinny jeans.",5
"Very flattering on. i'm 5'4"" /145lbs and took a small. i love how substantial the fabric is and how slimming it looks on. the only weird thing for me is getting it on?you had to step thru the opening on top, there are no zippers, buttons and if you have larger hips or butt, it will be a challenge to get on. once on, it looks great and believe it or not, roomy.",5
"This sweater jacket is beautiful!  i wasn't going to try it on because i am very sensitive to fabrics that are itchy, but i am so glad i did.  it's super soft and looks great with jeans and a t-shirt.  i have a petite frame, and it doesn't look boxy at all like some swing styles tend to do.  totally recommend this one!",5
"I was so skeptical about ordering this; it's really not my style. i'm more of a black halter dress kind of person. this is so cute, and flattering. it's well made, not flimsy, but is soft and pretty. i'm 5'6"" and weigh 130. i bought the small and it fits perfectly; the dress hits me right above the knee in front. i can see myself wearing this with cute sandals and a floppy hat at a beach bar, or wearing it wiht6 leggings ans shooties when it's cooler and dress it up with jewelry. side note; i'm",5
"I followed the other reviews and sized down. normally, i'm a small/medium in retailer (5'8""/135 for clarification) and i expected the garment to be a bit roomy. i ordered the small and when it arrived i almost called the corporate office to ensure i didn't have to pay rent on the romper, given that you could comfortably fit a small family of five in it. oddly, the arm-holes were normal sized? i returned this mess.",1
"Absolutely love the design, fabric, and fit of this dress! a perfect dress for many occasions, one of the many reasons i love this company! excellent customer service, employees, and of course adorable clothing. 10/10 would recommend buying this dress! and to all the taller girls, i am 5'11"" and 170lbs and this dress is still a good length! no need to continuously pull down and worry about who might see your rear.",5
I am not a one-piece body type. this is the best best best romper i have ever tried on!! i have a large bottom and this is so forgiving due to the 1)perfect length of shorts 2) drapey fabric (not clingy) 3) asymmetrical cut of the top. highly recommend!,5
"On shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but don't think will look that great on me. this dress was that item today. not only did i like it, but i liked the way it looked on me. i'm 5'3"", 140 pounds and purchased the medium. i loved it, the clerks loved it, and my very honest daughter also loved it. i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans.",5
"I am 5'9, very long waisted, generally a size 10-12 or med, but ordered the large to ensure it would not ride up.
(and this brand has run small in the past)
i am keeping the large but also ordering a med to compare as i have room to spare - length and width
either way, this is a keeper!!
it is adorable on, comfortable, my t-back bra works perfectly, very flattering, and way better than expected
the shorts length is a little longer than pictured, but there is an elastic waist with a cami under an",5
"This is a great summer shirt that will also transition into the fall. it is 100% rayon, so flows beautifully and feels really soft and cool against your skin. it is also washable. i think it looks much better in person than online.
i opted to have a snap added just above the top button which makes the shirt stay more closed and even-looking, as it tended to gap slightly at the top..

"Noticed this sweater as soon as i walked in the store. i am 5'5"" 135lbs, with an athletic build so teeter between a small and medium in tops. i spent a long time trying to decide if i preferred the small or medium fit. the sweater is a bit boxy so ended up sizing up, as the longer length seems to off set some of the boxiness. i am looking forward to wearing this with skinny jeans and boots. as another reviewer suggested, i think a denim shirt will look great underneath. rated a good in quality b",5
"I bought this in-store and it is much nicer than it appears in the photos online. the fabric is soft and drapey, making the top lightweight and flowy. this is not a fitted shirt, and i didn't feel it was overly large, so i think it runs true to size. i felt fine in an xs. t did feel the need to wear a camisole/ tank with it, but i tend towards the modest side. i bought it with the wide-legged linen pants and have worn it with wedge sandals with many compliments! i wish i'd noticed the navy blue",5
"After having my third child, i was looking for clothes to hide my tummy. i've always loved the comfort of a romper, but the typical cinched waist was never flattering on me. this romper does not disappoint. it hides areas i want hidden, but does so with style. i get numerous compliments whenever i wear this. i cannot say enough wonderful things about this piece!",5
Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it. lightweight. looks great with boots,5
Fabulous dress for both quality and design. the embroidery is gorgeous and the long sleeves make it practical to begin wearing immediately. true to size and flattering. looks darling with booties.,5
"Retailer rarely disappoints and this jumpsuit is a perfect example! i ordered a small based on reviews that it runs large and i do not like tight shorts and it was the right decision. the fabric, design and overall style make this piece easy to dress up or down. i cant wait to wear it. if you are on the fence order it now because this will not last long.",5
"Love this romper! it is beautifully made and classy. the fabric flows and the construction is soft and solid. i'm 5'5"" and 135 and the small is a little roomy but comfortably so. can't wait to where it.",5
This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.,1
I've received so many complements on this top. it's so comfortable and every time i wear it someone compliments the color. i ordered it in each color!,5
"Fell in love with this romper online, but since a few reviewers mentioned it ran large, i wanted to try it on in the store. this romper is even better in person! extremely flattering, delicate details and lined! it's adorable! i am glad i tried it on in the store. i am usually a size 6/medium, but the small worked better for me. i know this will be a staple of mine all spring and summer.",5
"I just got this today & love it. the embroidery on the front is gorgeous & rich looking. the material is soft & has a nice weight so that it drapes perfectly & is not at all see through. it will look great with sandals, flats or sandals with heels. i wear an xs & it fits tts. it falls just above the knee. i can see me wearing this a lot. i was worried about it looking too youthfull for my age, but it doesn't at all.",5
"I love this dress. the pattern is fun, the style is relaxed and breezy for spring/summer, and it is well-made. a steal at the sale price! also, it has pockets :) a huge plus for me. since it is a loose-fitting style, i would say it run just a tad big. i bought the s petite and i am 5'4"" 115lbs. i could've gone xs petite ...but the s fits well and looks great. the pattern is stunning. a great addition to my summer wardrobe. i thought about pairing it with a fitted white pant, but it hits me right",5
"Love this dress! perfect length and i love the construction and where the seams hit (not too long, not too short). i got so many compliments with this dress!",5
This shirt is very flattering and drapes beautifully. i am 5'7 175 and the medium fits perfectly. i bought in navy but am disappointed in the other options - i would have bought all of them had they been nice colors but the yellow and orange are really garish and unflattering on any skin tone and the white way too see-through which ruins the visual lines of the top. bummer! but i wear the navy every day so give that a thumbs-up.,5
"Sometimes ""swing"" styles don't work on me - i'm on the busty side so they often make me look like i'm wearing a tent from a side view. not so this sweater. it's more of an a-line shape than a ""swing"" style and is very flattering - i would think on all body types. i love that it zips up and has pockets. the plaid is really pretty and the overstitching detail and ribbbed bottom elevate the styling. super soft too - not an itch in sight!! 
(don't know why they call this coloration ""yellow"". it's n",5
This is a pretty tunic but it just didn't look right on me. the colors are nice and you can easily hide body flaws.,5
"A fun dress to just throw on go, nice details in the bodice, mix of blues in the prints, little longer in back is nice detail for those of us who want a shorter dress but not the worry of flashing from behind",5
"Cute design, the fabric drapes well, conceals many possible figure flaws, and has an upbeat, easy vibe. i got a small and am 125 lbs and 5'4"". i also washed it on a short cycle on cold and put it in the dryer for 5 minutes, which worked out just fine. great dress!",5
"The print, length and cut are all flattering. i bought the other tiny dress that was similar and will buy every pattern they make.",5
"I was so pleased to see this in the store, and i am glad that i had a chance to feel the knit. the combination of wool, cotton, and nylon creates a really soft, luxurious feel to the sweater. i was shocked that it didn't have cashmere in the blend, it is that soft! but, it is equally substantial. this sweater can surely be worn as a piece of outerwear, and it can be used as a layering piece. i consider this one tts because i typically wear a m in a knit that isn't fitted. i disagree with an earl",5
"Love everything about this: the length, cut, look, etc. i wear medium/large... went with medium and it was perfect.",5
"This top is gorgeous.  i normally wear s to m depending on brand and style.  ordered a s and it was so small i returned and have l on order.  it is cropped.  i am 5'3"" and it hit me as pictured on model.  if you are tall or like longer tops this may not be for you",5
Very cozy wrap!  the material is so soft.   find myself grabbing this anytime i am chilly day and night.  i offen find my daughter wrapped up in it too!  and with the arm holes it stays on.  very pleased.,5
"I almost walked past this until i saw it on the display mannequin. the shimmer is very subtle, but there, the picture here makes hte shirt look more like a grey shirt, but it is more ""sophisticated"" in person. very soft fabric, fitted on the ""wasit"", but romier on top, cowl is super flattering. usual sizze fit very nicely. highly recommend, i won't hev to tuck it in everytime i wear it :-# i think it can be dressed up #skirt# or down #jeans#, almost a basic t!",5
"I fell in love with these trousers as soon as i saw them online. i am a big fan of essentiel antwerp, their designs are unique and bold. these trousers definitely fit their aesthetic. the print is darker compared to the picture, making the green more of a dark olive and the blue almost looks black. they have an elastic waist so that helps for some of us who have a wider bottom. they cinch back in once they are buttoned at the waist, so it doesn't make your hips look wide. the fabric is soft and",5
This is a great winter addition to any wardrobe. warm but not hot. looks great with tights as a dress or with leggings. so many compliments.,5
"This top is sooo cute. it does not look like pajamas as one person said, it looks like a top. it's a bit on the boxy style, so anything you want to hide below is well covered. has a nice length to it. is not just for lounging. paired it with a black pencil skirt and it looked great. i ordered the xl (i am a 40d for reference) and it hung very nicely. its extremely soft and very comfy. i only wish they had more colors.",5
"In accordance with other reviewers, the pictures don't do this gorgeous lightweight sweater justice; the fabric has threads of gold, silver, and black that together make for shimmery elegance--not at all the heather grey in the photo.. i'm 5' 8"" 120 34b and the xs (regular) fits perfect--and actually more slimming/fit than in the photo. sleeves are long--which i love. a keeper, especially on sale!",5
"I actually like my shirt more than the other reviewers it seems. i am little (5'1"" and 103) and i don't think it's too boxy at all. i like the way it hangs. and i'll say i like it much more in person than on the model. it's somehow cozier than it looks in the picture. it's a real boosh (that mean's comfy.) i wouldn't have picked it from the online pic, but in person, it really caught my eye.",5
"When i walked into my local retailer, two of the saleswomen were wearing this stunning top in totally different ways, and i knew it would be the perfect gift for my mom. unfortunately the small was sold out, but they were able to order it online and have it sent. gorgeous medium-to-lightweight fabric that looks great out or tucked in.",5
"This top is super soft cotton, with raw edges on the sleeves and hem. i bought the green top, which is a medium, faded olive color. despite the picture, this top is shortish in the front and on the sides, which are slit. the top is also very, very boxy. it's wide across, and doesn't ""fit"" the body at all. the sleeves are a slimmer fit, which contrasts nicely with the wide body. the picture is very deceptive. that said, this top is perfect for early fall/ late summer. super comfy. floaty. i wear",5
"I fell in love with this dress when i saw it online and got it as soon as it went on sale 25% off. the colors are vibrant and the fit is perfect whether you have areas that you want to hide or not. it is true to size and i can see how you would want to size it down since it's baby doll shape, but it didn't work for me around the arm holes (and mine are not that big). i am 5'3"" and 120 lb and size 2 worked perfect.",5
"I really wanted to love this but the cut was very wide, short, and crooked. after it was washed once, it was completely unwearable because it hung all wrong.",1
"The color is perfect for fall.  dressy enough for work, and looks great with a pair of jeans.",5
"I love baseball style tees and when i saw the homebase tee (in two colors no less), i was very thrilled especially since it was during the 20% mother's day promotion on all items. based on the model's photos, the top looks flattering with a swing type style. i usually wear a medium and bought a small size in this top. when the package was delivered, i excitedly opened it and found two tees looking like maternity tops which would be lovely if i was pregnant. the tops are so wide not like the webs",1
Great fitting and super cute!!!!! my husband said this is the cutest bathing suit i've owned!!! and i live in bathing suits!!!,5
I love this design so much and it is very well made. i also like the adjustable shoulder straps and that the cups are not padded cups. i think that makes it look less like a bra and more like a bathing suit. only con is that it seems to run small.,5
"A beautiful classic!
love the denim fabric in such a pretty style.
this top has a more flattering fit than appears in the pics.
the fabric is soft and the fit very flattering.
ordered my usual size medium and fits perfectly........very true to size.",5
"I ordered this online, with a little hesitation due to the negative reviews.
it arrived and it is beautiful!
the beading and subtle cut outs are gorgeous.
the colors of the beadwork in contrast to the nude tone of the fabric is stunning and elegant.!
the fit is very very flattering!!!!!
runs very true to size.",5
"Really cute top(especially the back)!  i've tried on several of these tops that overlap in the back and none of them lay as nice as this one.  the soft cotton fabric really works well with this style.  runs tts and i love that the arms are more fitted with some stretch to the fabric.  regular length works fine on my petite frame as well.  the color is a darker cream and almost has a slight nubby effect to it.  first one i received had a snag/hole in the lower sleeve, so hopefully it holds up.",5
This is a tts basic tee with the added flare of the ruffled back peplum and the elegance of the beaded front neckline. the beading is lovely and mine was intact. i bought my normal small based on reviews and the fit was perfect. (34-b) the beige color is a classic neutral and can be worn year round by just adding a jacket or sweater. love it!,5
"Bought in the store, will look great with black or dark blue jeans and a fun long necklace.  does not fit like it looks on the model, it is more fitted.  i plan on wearing a spaghetti strapped cami underneath because the back has a draping effect and is open.  the front is on the shorter side but the bottom of the shirt (not including tassels) reaches the top of my jeans, and the tassels hang below.  it is a very versatile top, one that can be dressed up or down.  sleeves above wrist.",5
Very pretty top! the fabric is super soft. i ended up sizing up from my regular xs to a s because the chest area was just a bit snug.,5
Love these lightweight pants... they're beyond comfortable and the print is darling! hope this designer has additional pieces next season!,5
"I adore this shirt. like a previous reviewer, the shirt runs a little small in the bust. i got a 6 instead of my typical 4 and it looks great. the quality is great and the color is lovely. the feel of the fabric is nice substantial weight.",5
So thin and see thru it's not even wearable in public. extremely cheap and ill fitting for any price let alone this price. i feel like they will rip the moment i wear them out. going back.,1
"This is adorable! the sweater is light-weight and soft. please know that the sweater line falls right at my mid-riff, followed by the fringe, so for me, it's almost cropped. the fringe covers my mid-riff. the back is open and so this sweater will not be super warm in the winter, but it is stylish and cute. i love it! it's different and unique. i purchased xxs in petite. fits a little more cropped than the photo shows.",5
"These leggings are so thick and soft! they feel like velvet on your skin. i am so, so happy with my purchase, and would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a unique, comfortable, and quality pair of leggings.",5
"This button down is to die for! the material is incredibly soft and comfy. it looks great with my retailer leggings, and is also a great look with my casual denim, paired with a cardi and flats or booties. i've worn it several times for different looks and always get compliments on it! definitely a head-turning piece.",5
"This sweater looks just as pictured on the model. its very warm though even with cropped sleeves. i ordered a large and it was true to size but roomy. i liked this top very much but is thicker than seems. outer grey material isn't very pleasant & itchy, however the bottom portion is an underneath gown and attached to sleeves inside so its very soft on touch.",5
"Fantastic top! fits, flatters and falls beautifully! i loved the white so much i went back for the black! i wear with jeans, leggings and with pant suits. lovely with all!",5
"This coat is so stylish and actually reminded my daughter of the ""madeline"" stories. she just got her first paid internship in the city, so i am buying this beautiful red coat for her to celebrate. after all, a girl has to make a good first impression...",5
"Ordered this coat in a small. it is meant to be a slouchy and the fit is perfect - i'm 5'5"" and weigh around 120. the sleeves are slightly longer than 3/4. the fabric is so soft, the coat is unlined and drapes beautifully. this coat reminds me of a coat my mother had when i was a child.... she referred to it as her 'car coat'... i believe that was a style then. worth the $.",5
"I bought the white and olive today. i usually get a size s, but opted for the xs for this shirt. i am longer torsoed than perhaps average, so it came to just below mid-butt, which i like. my shoulders are on the broader side and a bit muscular, but even still the xs was perfect and cute, rather than just comfy. def an undershirt is needed for these, but i run cold, so i nearly always have an undershirt. the fabric is just nice enough that i could wear the shirt with a fun, nice skirt with a high",5
Love this top. i have it in several colors and i'm waiting for the black to be restocked. it's somewhat sheer. perfect w my kimonos,5
I bought this tee for a light summer top as i love linen. this top does not disappoint. i bought my usual size xs and the length is good-slightly longer in back. i purchased the black and the grey. the grey will be great with jeans in any color and the black i can wear either dressed up or down. the quality seems good. great purchase!,5
"I have been looking for a fall/spring coat to wear when the weather is between 30 and 55 degrees. this ""coat"" looks great in the pictures, but so disappointing in reality. the best thing i can say is that the fabric is soft. it is unlined, so i'm not sure why you'd even wear it -- if the weather's warm enough to wear a thin, unlined jacket, why not just wear a sweater? the weight is not what i would expect at this price point. even worse, the design is terrible; my husband (who has a great eye)",1
Visions of sartorial splendor danced in my head as i planned my instagram posts centered around this coat. and then it showed up on my door and my dreams were crushed. i'd already read the reviews and knew the coat was unlined and would be oversized. i did not expect it to be soooo sloppy. especially around the collar. there is nothing crisp about it. i've had boiled wool outer ware before that held its shape much better than this. if i wanted fleece i wouldn't have picked retailer as the s,1
"I adore this top! i ordered in the white and wear it with everything! i am a 34c and size 6 and purchased the xs. it was slightly snug in the arms but it does stretch. i just bought the black as well, as it truly it a great staple piece. forewarning: do not dry this! my husband accidentally did and i was forced to buy another one, since it shrunk so much. the fabric is lightweight and great for summer, but keep in mind that it is thin and may require something underneath (tank top, etc.)",5
"This dress was so comfortable, i wore it all day - to church, out to brunch and actually slept in it. it would travel well, too.",5
I bought this t-shirt in three colors and i'm keeping them because they work for what i want (travel clothes) but the t-shirts run big and are too boxy. i think they look nice if you tuck them in.,5
"I echo what the other reviews say - this is a tshirt but it's very flattering. i bought the black and dressed it with a bright turquoise necklace and received a ton of compliments. extremely comfortable. i've been just looking for this shirt when i get home from work or having to do errands because it is that comfortable.

i'm buying more it's so comfortable and flattering.",5
"Love this cost! runs large. usually wear a medium or large, ordered a medium and had to exchange it for a small. fits perfect now. not very heavy so don't buy if you're looking for a warm coat.",5
"I love everything about this skirt! the fabric is super comfy and it drapes wonderfully. fits great. a bit long for me as i'm 5'6 but totally worth it. i don't wear heels so i might need to alter the length, but i knew it would be long when i ordered it. i purchased the grey, but i might have to order the taupe as well!",5
"I bought an extra small and i love it (i'm a size 2-4). it's warm, it's comfortable, it fits with everything, can be dressed up or down, it's not lined but it is well finished and does not feels like a sweater coat...it feels like you have a new friend...",5
Loved this sweater when i saw it online. when it arrived it had a very strong chemical smell to it and was very stiff textured. despite the dry clean only tag i decided to soak it overnight in woolite to soften it and get rid of the smell. the next day i rinsed it in cold water and block dried it outside. it still wreaked of chemicals and took three more subsequent washings to finally get rid of the smell. hand washing did not hurt it whatsoever fyi. it looks fab with jeans and is very comfy. i,5
I love this coat. it was a great purchase and i would reccomend it to others. it looks great with layers and is comfortable for 30-50 degree temps. definitely size down when buying.,5
"This top is light and swingy with a bold pattern that looks even better in person. the neckline is very high, which was a surprise for a summer tank, but it's cut well. nice surprise: on seem pockets! wore it today for the first time and received many comments. a keeper. fits true to size and perfect for my petite build up top.",5
"I love this jumpsuit. it's fun, flirty, and seems to put a smile on the faces of passersby. it works for multiple occasions/events, and is so comfortable. if daytime pajamas sounds good to you, this is your jumpsuit. dress it up with an up-do and dangly earrings, or down with slip-ons and a cardigan, i have found that i can't go wrong with it. fits me just perfectly, doesn't wrinkle too much during wear, and the adjustable shoulder ties are convenient.",5
"The photo misrepresents how large this sweater is. it is giant! petite ladies stay away from this sweater. i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs, but this just floored me. the neckline wouldn't even stay up on my upper body, it was that loose. also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model. it is like a tent. i'm so bummed. the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft. it's too bad it doesn't fit smaller women.",1
"I love the serif jeans and these stet mid-rise jeans fit perfectly, too! true to size and i really like the wash. i am 5'4"" and a size 2, and the 26 fits just right. because of my height they come closer to the ankle on me than what you see on the model. i have more of an athletic build, rather than curvy.",5
"Flattering fit, true to size, i ordered 31 which fit perfectly. i am 5'8"", 145 lbs. wish it came in off white,sand and black. great with boots, and more substantial than some leggings. also extremely comfy!!!",5
These look great on my wife. very versatile and go with like 80% of her wardrobe. she raves about them and they look great.,5
"Love this shawl/wrap! was looking to purchase the white & warren cashmere poncho (but available online only), and then saw this in the store. tried it on and fell in love. love that it's 100% cashmere -- super soft and warm. would recommend!",5
Very flattering ang comfy but they do run slightly big. i stayed with my true size because i am thicker in waist but if small waisted size down. fit ty's in legs and bottom. love color!,5
Great fit and extremely comfortable.,5
This dress is so beautifully embroidered with really cool mix of colors. it is pricey but i do think it will stand the test of time and become an retailer vintage piece. planning to wear it now with wedges and in the fall with booties and a light sweater.,5
I love these jeans! i wear them all the time. i love the way they fit and the price is great. please make these exact pants in more colors!,5
I love the details that this cardigan has. try it!,5
"I tried it one bcasue it is on sale and i love it...too bad i don't need yet anothr black top. fit is loose/flowy, but the ruffles add a littl cahrm to the shirt. tried on regualr xs, i could proably go to petites though, but thankfully there is a button at the neck",5
"I ordered this for the colors, and modern geometric design. colors are as shown. a beautiful combination that works well with blue jeans, and my burgundy flats. it's casual and soft enough to wear all day. i wore it to the beach, then out to dinner the same evening! oh... i spilled red wine on it at the beach, and couldn't wash it until the next day. i used dawn dish detergent and hydrogen peroxide on the spots, then laundered in the washer on hot and they came out, completely. i air dried, and",5
"I normally wear a size 27, but i have a pair of shorts by same designer bought several years ago in a size 26 and so i went with a size 26 for this purchase. they fit perfectly. i would have liked to order the petite, but it did not appear to be an option. the fabric is very soft and stretchy. they are little loose around the ankle, but i have very skinny calves and ankles, so that is not so surprising. the color is a perfect grey that will go with everything. i would buy these in other colors.",5
"Pretty and with pockets! also, nice quality for the price. interesting texture.",5
I absolutely love these pants! they are my new favorite! thank you :),5
"I am very happy with this poncho/sweater. it is my first cashmere sweater and it feels so soft and luxurious! true, it does not have full length sleeves, but if you adjust the sweater so that it comes down lower on your shoulders, it will come well past your elbows, covering most of your arms. i feel very elegant wearing it. looks great with skinny pants or leggings and boots. would recommend,",5
Love this sweater so much i purchased the grey and the pink. so far no issues with the stitching.,5
"I ordered the large, but it swallowed me. the store happened to have a medium, so i was able to make an exchange. the medium fit perfect. i'm delighted to include this in my wardrobe!",5
I love these jeans! perfect amount of stretch without sag. great color.  ordered my usual size 28. i wish they had these in olive and black!,5
"So disappointed. bought these in a 29 and should've gone with a 28. they're super cute - i got the green. the fit is off. like the other reviews, they stretch out way too much. i would return these but have already washed them. they wash terribly, too. there are weird fading marks all over, even when washed in cold water like the tag states. so disappointed that i spent my gift card from christmas on these. i've been a loyal retailer customer for years and this is the first time i've been severely",1
"I got this shirt in an xxsp, and it has a great slim body. the front ruffle isn't overpowering, although i don't love the ruffles on the sleeves. i think it's just a little too much, but they aren't visible under a sweater or jacket. the length is just right, so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy. the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through. it's a good shirt.",5
"I bought the green pair in store and loved their fit. i ended up buying the rust color online too! i'm 5'3"" 125 and i went down a size to a 26. cause they will stretch a little. perfect length for my height too great with wedges or boots.",5
"I bought this dress after i had overnighted a different one and it wasn't going to be delivered on time. i'm so happy that i bought this dress. its so comfortable and easy to wear. i got lots of compliments on it.
it runs very large though. i ended up with a size 6. i initially tried on the 10, as i have a larger chest. the 6 still had plenty of room.",5
It feels weightless and is so feminine. great for layering or on its own. so happy i purchased it - know i will get tons of use out of it.,5
"This sweatshirt is a very nice staple piece! i think it can be easily dressed up and down. the quality is quite nice and should hold up over time.

the sizing of this really depends on the desired fit. i elected to go with a size small because i felt that it fit a little bit closer to my figure and the length seemed to go better with skirts. but honestly, i tried the medium as well, and it was much different... just a bit more slouchy and looser in the arms if layering is desired. for reference,",5
Everything that pilcro makes for pants fit me great! i am not skinny but these pants fit me in a way that you can't see my belly. i love when pilcro goes on sale because they are a great quality and getting their stuff on sale is a bonus.,5
"I bought these about a month ago and i love them! great fit, not too tight for legging jeans, which means i can dress up with a tunic and boots for work. so stretchy and comfortable, but still made out of a jean-type material. love the color - it's a bit of a gray black, so looks great with everything!",5
"I'm 5'4 and 125 and the 28 fit comfortably. i initially bought the 27 but felt it was snug in the seat so switched out for the 28, i'm 52 so didn't want the painted on look. they will need to be washed more frequently since they do stretch out as they are worn. love the gray color and goes with so many fall colors.",5
Obsessed with these pants. i have them in the green color and was looking for them to go on sale ! great fit very comfortable,5
"Really disappointing quality. these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month! i love pilcros, and am totally shocked at the poor quality...retailer, i hope this is just a fluke. not worth the money!",1
"These are colors i normally never wear...baby pink, lavender, light blue...but what drew me to this was the wine color mixed in. it's my favorite. i also adore a good poncho. this poncho is so rich and so heavenly. super soft, very oversized, incredibly nice fabric...its like a light weight sweater. lots of movement and such a statement piece, it will look great over a white tank top, or an all black ensemble with great boots. this only comes in two sizes but runs large. i'm 5'8 and curvy...and",5
"Bought the green in the store. wore them every week for 3 weeks so i bought the bronze color too. i usually wear a 26 in pilcro because they do give a little during the day. i had to go up to the 27 because the thighs were a little too snug for me. there's a zipper at the ankle so getting you foot through isn't a problem. the fabric is sturdy. it almost feels like a brushed cotton (soft to the touch). they zip up the side so are very slimming. i'm 5'4"" 120# for reference.",5
"I am curvy/petite. this fits great, is true to size, is super comfortable and lined with cotton. very pretty and well made.",5
"I saw this t on sale and ordered it. i had second thoughts, thinking it would be just like a lot of ts i already have. well, i got it today and am thrilled. the fabric is so soft, a sumptuous softness that makes me feel good. the fit is the fit we all want in a great t, nice fit, not too baggy, not too tight, and it is so flattering. it doesn't show off my tummy as so many other ts do. i can wear this with jeans or a skirt. so glad i got it!",5
I tried this on in the store and it was huge. i couldn't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i don't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either. definitely not worth the price.,1
"This dress is gorgeous in person, soft and wonderfully comfortable with two large pockets. it also comes with a cotton knit slip for added swing. i bought at size 6 which was two sizes smaller than my normal size 10 in retailer dresses. i have worn twice and each time 2 random strangers have complimented it. it dry cleaned beautifully and it is really fun to wear. the model is shows the neck wide open but it is very cute tied in a little bow. expensive maybe, but well worth it.",5
"This dress definitely runs large, so i ordered it through my local store, in order to get a size that would fit. i ordered one size down, but could have gone down 2. i love the embroidered design. i just wore the dress to a slovak festival, yesterday, and it fit right in :-) very comfortable, and fun to wear.",5
"Best ""jeggings"" ever! they look and fit like skinny jeans but feel like leggings. soft but substantial fabric, nice dark gray, worn in color.",5
This is the oddest fitting pullover. there is too much fabric around the chest. it is fitted everywhere else but then balloons out in the front. i liked it at first but really started to dislike all the bunchiness (is that a word?). i gave it away..,1
"Lets discuss the neckline: it's fabulous!
furthermore, this sweater can go anywhere,
it's dress up, dress down.

feeling low? this girl will lift you up and take you to town.",5
"Love the length, color, and rise. new favorite jeans! they're a little loose around the ankle and the way they hang is the only thing i don't like.",5
"I love this summery blouse. it sits at high hip, so no tucking in! the sleeves are fluttery and flattering to the arm. i own this same pattern in a knit, and like it so much i got the woven when i saw it. the only downsides are that it has to be ironed and it the sleeves are too big to layer under a sweater.",5
"I ordered these jeans to wear to work since they are very dark and tailored. my usual size 26 fit perfectly, but they did have to go to the tailors since they were incredibly long, which is nice for those of you that need more length.given that i usually am in skinnies, i like how they fit singly on the hips and slightly flare out towards the bottom, but not too much. these will work well with a variety of looks, making the price tag well worth it.",5
"Just love this sweater, have it in both colors. can be dressed up or more casual!",5
This dress is really beautiful in person. it comes with a spaghetti strap clingy cotton slip underneath. it runs at least 2 sizes large. i tried my usual size 6 and needed to go down to a zero.,5
"I just got this in and i love it! it's happy, super soft, and will be perfect for the fall season in new orleans, since it's not too light but also not heavy. i see myself wearing this often!",5
Just like in picture! super cute and comfortable sweater!,5
"I am all about beach cover ups. i already have the leblon one from this season (which i loooooove) but i love this one too-and it is in my go-to color which is fantastic! i love beach cover ups, i always imagine the sounds of the birds, waves rolling in, and a nice breeze allowing it to flow as i walk along side the beach. my reality, of course, is chasing after screaming kids and walking along a mn pond (not rolling waves) but this dress would at least make me feel like i am in my own little wo",5
"Love the pockets and back of dress. the buttons on the the straps allow for them to be adjusted. that's a plus. i'm 5'3"" with an athletic build at 34d. the medium fits perfect",5
This is a beautiful casual top...it is a loose fit that is generously sized so instead of my usual large i purchased the medium for a better fit...the length is perfect not too long or short! the colors coordinate great with denim!,5
I bought an xl and they looked like they would have been a small. can't review anything else because i couldn't even get them on.... ridiculous,1
"When i saw these in the store i liked how they were different from usual leggings and, the nice fabric weight. i especially liked how they were not tight at the ankle and fit similar to a pair of ankle pants. since i wanted a slightly looser fit, i usually wear a 2/4 i went w a medium. can't wait for the weather to get colder so i can wear them with a sweater and ankle boots.",5
"I look at the top quite a few times before i bought it.  i absolutely love it !  it's a super soft thick cotton material,  it drapes perfectly and wears well.",5
"Really like the quality, color, and overall design of these jeans. they ran a little long on me, but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties. i didn't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed. so, glad that was the case given the price tag on them. i am 5'7"", 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed. definitely recommend these jeans",5
"I ordered this in both an extra small and a small... i found that there was a very big difference in the two sizes- the extra small was true to size and had a great width, but was shorter in length than i would've liked (if it shrunk at all, it would've been unwearable). the small was quite a jump in size and was a little wider than i liked, but i decided to keep that one. 

the top was very cute and comfortable when i wore it, however i just washed it once on delicate in cold water and when i",1
"This top is adorable. normally wear small or xs but got xxs based on reviews, and glad i did. still really loose but so cute. would have preferred petite but sold out.",5
"I knew i had to have this as soon as i saw it pop up in the tops section. it's effortless. love the quirky design and the overall fit. it's a tad on the large side, but i'm all about the flow these days. oh, and the poms at the bottom about sent me over the edge. fantastic piece.",5
Very comfortable great quality with beautiful crocheted front top and lovely blend of colors,5
Great top!! can be dressed up or down. the lace is great quality and i love the border detailing. i found this shirt to run pretty true to size.,5
I love the unique design! the details are wonderful. it runs a bit large but it works. a great piece.,5
These pants are amazing.  material on the thicker/heavier side.  the pants are very comfortable and very cute for the fall.  fits perfect,5
"Love! i always used to wear skinny jeans until i discovered these!!! highly recommend. they elongate your legs and curve in just the right places. super flattering! plus, they are extremely comfortable. however, i'm 5 ft 2 inches and i have to wear a good 2 inch heel with them!",5
"I ordered this shirt in the grey/blue color choice; the creamy grey is perfectly heathered and the blue silk-like bottom is a classy touch. the fit of this shirt in the arms, torso, and back was flattering with a little room to drape. love it!",5
"I love this peasant dress! i have worn it twice already with black lizard cowboy boots/frye jane boots, black tights and silver sparkly earrings -no need for a necklace because of the beautiful beading at the yoke.
the fabric is 100% rayon and has a beautiful drape, so it doesn't poof out like a maternity dress. it is lined, has 3/4 sleeves with an elasticized cuff, and hits around my knee. this dress could have definitely supported pockets in the side seams or patch pockets on the front. i have",5
"I bought this today in black. it fits true to size and is very flattering. i love the draping, the weight of the fabric, and the length . i would buy it in another color i like it so much. i will probably wear this with jeans and boots with a sweater over it. i wasn't sure i was going to like the little connector piece across the front neckline, but it works. if it wasn't there the top would probably gape open.",5
"I saw this dress online this morning, went into a store this afternoon and walked out with it! i love this brand because the designs are modest, but feminine and practical. this dress is made of a thicker study cotton with beautiful all over embroidery. the fit is tts, and you can adjust the waist to fit loose or a bit more snug. the length is just above my knee at 5'3. i plan to wear this now with black boots and a furry vest, and later by itself with sandals and big sunnies!",5
"I bought this in the neutral motif, and it's exactly as it appears online except a bit more vivid in real life. the colors are ivory with dusty pink and blue/gray puffs of color. the fabric is incredibly soft. i usually wear a small in tops but went up to a medium and i'm glad i did. if you like things really fitted, i guess you could order your normal size, but since i wanted this to have some room for long sleeves underneath, i went with the medium. this zip-hoodie is great quality and it look",5
"I tried this dress at the store today and couldn't leave without it. also tried the pacquerette shirtdress which has a similar boho/peasant vibe and overall preferred the fit and look of this one. plus, its lined, which the paquerette shirtdress is not for the same price. fit was very similar to the anwen peasant dress, which i also have, and the regular size xs fit me much the same as in that dress. it is maybe 1 inch longer though, but still that makes it a couple of inches above the knee for",5
"I love this dress. i typically do not like or wear dresses often, and definitely not this style. i'm glad i tried something different. i received numerous compliments on how flattering and attractive it is. yes the belt is only in the front, but i cinched it very tight and it pulled the back in. i bought size s. it was very form fitting in the top and waist, and not too big through the hips. i have a 38"" bust and i can button all the top without pulling. i wore it with black tights and high brow",5
"I saw this in the store and it caught my eye right away due to its bold color and pattern. i tried on an extra small and it was large, especially in the sleeves. i ordered an extra small in petite and it fits perfectly. i love the velvet and jeweled detail along with the cris cross tie. i wore it to work today and received so many compliments. one lady said how artsy i looked. i paired it with burgundy velvet tie up boots to complete the look. totally worth the money ladies!!",5
"I wore this dress on thanksgiving with black tights and black flats and it looked great. the dress is forgiving if you're trying to hide a chunky waistline because the belt doesn't go all the way around. it's just in the front so it gives the illusion of a waistline and doesn't look like just a sack. if you have a great waistline, you may not like this! i wish it were a bit longer but with black tights, it looked fine. (i'm 5' 5"", no where near as tall as the model, and it was about 2"" above my",5
"I tried this on (xs) and thought it would be great, butit was simply bog on me and boxy. unfortunately, they are out of petite in the grey color (my favorite of the 3). this top is soft and feminine if it fits properly, but too big was a little too boxy.",5
"This is a lovely top! sooo soft, very flattering draping if you have a bit of a tummy. i wasn't sure about it on the hanger but was pleasantly surprised when i tried it on- very glad i have it a chance!",5
"This dress is a marvel. it's flattering and cute. it is great for work, a date or just a casual day. and machine washable! best thing i've ever purchased from retailer.",5
"I love this dress. i would have never picked it off the hanger in the store, in fact i went right past it. however, when i was in the dressing room trying something else on i saw two girls wearing it and it was adorable. i immediately tried it on and loved it. i think it runs really big. i am normally a size 8/athletic build and i bought the x-small. i small also fit but was a bit too baggy. most tops/dresses at retailer also run big so it makes sense this does too but there is no way i am a true",5
"Cute and different dress, cute with boots.very comfortable, runs large, could size down",5
"In a sea of dresses, this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store. i am a pear shape, and ended up trying both the medium and the large, taking the medium home. it was super flattering on, and was an appropriate length to pair with tights.

here's where the problem happened. i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving, i put it on, and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband. so disappointed.",1
It's exactly how it appears in the pictures-awesome shirt,5
I bought this shirt in the turquoise color with the navy trim and love it! color is as pictured. shirt is very soft and flowy. the length was a little shorter than expected (the slits on the side almost reach the top of my jeans) so i'm glad i got the regular xs and not the petite. this shirt is unique without getting too crazy!,5
"Lovely! at 5'6"", 34a-28/29-36, the size small was a great fit. moss color is really quite grey. drapes beautifully and is an easy wear.",5
"This top is soft, flattering, modest enough to wear to work, but subtly sexy (and i'm amply endowed at 36d). i just wish i'd gotten one in every color.",5
"I tried this on at the store and am coming online to order it in petite. i'm 5'1"" and the length hit me just below the knee in the regular length so i'm hoping it will hit just above the knee in petite. it was very cute, might run a bit large but basically true to size. size down if between sizes. it has a little bit of sparkle beading around the neck which is nice.",5
"This black dress with raised white embroidery is lovely and flattering. the fabric has a nice texture and is medium-weight cotton, and machine washable. the dress is unlined. it's a bit hard to get on and take off even though the buttons can be undone, which helps. there is a tie at the waist, drawstring-style. i only wish my store had the petite size, as i am wondering whether the xs that fit me in the store will still fit as an xs p.",5
Just wanted to review so people know this hoodie has a zipper. it's very soft and comfy but i was looking for a pullover hoodie and am disappointed that once again retailer's picture doesn't match the actual product. it does fit true to size however.,1
Got this today and highly recommend it! it fits perfectly and is very flattering! i can see wearing this all wear round! perfect date shirt!,5
"I saw this dress online and b-lined it to the store to try on. it is a beautifully made dress. lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket. feels very boho and chic. i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress. i was almost turned off by the price, but decided to see it in person. worth every penny. wear it with sandals or tall boots, could have worn a medium, but a little tight for 38c on top.",5
"I love everything about this top. first, it's super flattering, especially if you have a tummy. i am small chested, and it makes me look a little chestier than i am. i tried on both the xs and s in the black (it's really a charcoal gray) but preferred the fit of the xs. note: i'm 5'8"" / 136 lbs and typically wear an xs or s in most retailer tops. the small seemed too drapey and the armholes were a tad big. my store didn't have the wine color or i would have purchased it too.",5
"This arrived today and i am thrilled with it. the material is soft but not at all clingy. it drapes perfectly, falling just above the knee. there is a matching slip that is as nicely made as the dress itself. what a find!",5
Love this dress! the neckline is gorgeous,5
"Very cool top! i purchased this in the black, which is more of a very dark gray (imagine sanded silk). it's very figure flattering and accentuates curves. it also disguises any minor tummy issues. not to clingy, but follows your form. the fabric is well made with a perfect drape to match the style. definitely a winner!",5
"This dress is absolutely gorgeous! the colors are actually very bright. it has a little embroidery and beading in the chest area. the fabric is actually very soft and it comes with built in slip. i found that it runs true to size. i got a medium, as i wanted it to be more roomy. i'm planning to wear it with booties, long boots, or sandals in the spring. i think it will make a great teacher dress.",5
"Very figure flattering!! i am 5'6"" 128 lbs 32b chest and size xs is perfect",5
I cannot believe how different this top looks in person. i purchased this in the store and fell in love with it immediately. viewing the pictures on here does not do the top justice. it is very form fitting and compliments large busted women. the cut is not too low and lays beautifully.,5
"I had my eye on this tee for awhile, and finally ordered the turquoise/navy in the small. as soon as i received it, i ordered it in the taupe/peach and am contemplating one more! i plan to layer it now and can't wait to wear it solo next spring and summer. the colors are gorgeous (although the taupe is more dark gray which i love), the material is very soft, stretchy and comfortable, but it's the very flattering cut that sold me. it hangs beautifully and doesn't cling to my middle but skims it p",5
"This dress is a winner, i'm baffled that there is only one review? i thought this was a dolan dress. the material is soft and substantial. the cut and style hides figure flaws without adding bulk. this versatile dress is perfect for all seasons and all social situations. i'm 5'3"" 135# 38/28/35 and purchased size m.",5
"I just bought this and really think it is a great dress! it is conservative, and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church. i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes, yet i do not like to look ""frumpy."" this is cute and chic, yet conservative. also j got 25% because it is black friday. thank you retailer!!!",5
Perfection. soft. lived in feel and look without holes or rips. and for someone who is 5 ft 2 in. they are just the right length if i don't feel like cuffing the bottom. fit tts.,5
I ordered this in a small and it fit perfectly. i love the longer length so that it can be worn with leggings. the detail is so pretty especially the colorful side panels.,5
"I bought these leggings for yoga. i love them. the material is so soft and also seems sweat wicking which is a plus. the back detail on the calf is a nice touch of flair compared to basic leggings. the waistband is wide and did not fold over during practice! for reference, i am 5'4, 130 lbs and i purchased a m. fit was great. i normally wear size 27-28 in pants. would recommend.",5
"This seems like a great top! i have only worn it once, but it is super soft and comfy, yet stylish. sleeves are fun. color is vibrant as shown.",5
I purchased this shirt to wear postpartum so i could easily be comfortable but still cute. it will work well for the fall with some cute jeans and booties. i cannot wait to wear it....any day now!  great choice.,5
"It is a beautiful shirt and fits perfectly. i purchased it in ivory and although not a true ivory, it has some pinkish tones to it, it is absolutely beautiful. looks perfect with a long necklace and jeans.",5
"Regarding the product, high quality materials and overall make. extremely comfortable and flattering cut. i'd love this in all the colors of the rainbow.",5
"This is a beautiful top, the fit is very flattering. i'm tall with broad shoulders and the sleeves hit just above my elbow. i wear it on the weekends and to work...very versatile. i washed it in the washing machine and hung to dry, it's the same size and no fading..not sure about the others below with shrinkage issues. highly recommend it!",5
This top is extremely well made. the fabric is so soft. the style is very stylish. it is very figure flattering and chic. a keeper! i'm petite and the style is not overwhelming.,5
This top flows so nice. i get so many compliments when i wear it. plus the color is an interesting blue,5
So glad i finally bought this! love it!!! and have received many compliments. wore it with brown over the knee boots. one of my fave all time outfits right now.,5
"After readying the reviews of this dress, i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner. boy, was i wrong! first, this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on. i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o' one size fits all' sizing. it did not embrace my curves at all. the material was not as chic as i would have thought. overall, the entire dress was not flattering. honestly, i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it.",1
"Too much material everywhere. i am 122lbs 5'4"" and i ordered an xs as usual. i was overwhelmed in a blanket of knitted material of muted colors. nice green slip, though. i will return it asap. this is super-ugly.",1
"This dress hangs horribly. unlike the photo, the waist does not cinch. too bad. the colors are great and the quality of the material is nice. because i bought it on sale, i may try to tailor it to work, but unless you are willing to do that, its a no go. :-(",1
"I was on the fence about this dress but so glad i did, thanks to the reviews i sized down from my normal medium to a small and this dress is definitely one of my favs!!!! it is a quality comfortable material that does stretch and allows you movement with ease. the illusion slims me in the middle where i need it most. i adore this dress.",5
"I almost missed this, i snagged it during the black friday sale online. i got an extra small and it fits great-not too fitted. the back is a cotton material with some stretch to it. the embroidery is beautiful.",5
I am returning the dress. it has too much volume and is not flattering at all,1
I like this dress a lot. it does not have much form but with a belt looks great!,5
"Love this dress! the stripes are flattering, the material is interesting and it swings! it's feminine and fun!",5
"I ordered the peach/ivory/tan version in size xl and i love everything about this dress. i'm size xl and a pear-shape so dresses can be hit or miss. this one is a favorite. it's so soft. the mix of colors and the sizing of the stripes/pleats is flattering. it's nice being more fitted on top & flowy through the bottom. i love this dress so much! i'm having fun pairing different combos of necklaces, vests, pins, belts & boots with it. i'll get good use out of this through spring. comfortable, pret",5
"I have been self conscious about a recent weight gain going from a size 6 to a size 10-12, but this dress makes me look & feel skinny again. i know people have suggested that vertical stripes help if you want to elongate your figure. it is true. thanks to this dress i look like my old self, and i am super comfortable wearing this all the time. you can wear this dress from day to night, you can dress this up or down. it looks great with a jean jacket and high-tops, or high-heeled booties with a n",5
"By itself, this dress is a disaster. it's semi-maternity and offers no shape at all. however, with a belt, it really becomes the sweetest sweater dress. i can't believe how flattering the dress becomes with a belt, the skirt falls perfectly , it's perfect, especially with it's rich colors.

for $50, you can't go wrong and i'm positive you need this dress. boots, heels, jacket, whatever, it goes up and down, it's perfect!",5
It's a perfect maternity dress but i love that i will still be able to wear it with a belt once the baby comes.,5
"I walked into a hair salon wearing this dress, and everyone who walked by complimented me. to me, that's a definite winner! i got the blue color, and the various colors in it are vibrant and lively. the underdress is like a full slip and an added bonus. this probably also makes the dress hang the way it should. there's no static or clinging where there shouldn't be. i was afraid i might be too short to pull this off, but i absolutely love it.",5
"I saw this dress online first and suspected i would like it, but the price scared me away. then, while visiting in portland, i saw it on sale at an retailer store. when i came out of the dressing room to look in a bigger mirror the store clerk said, ""well that's a no-brainer!"" i thought the same thing. i love this dress so much i actually would have paid full price for it. it's super fun and easy to wear; i paired it with navy blute tights and suede ankle booties. i'm 5'6, 138 lbs and the m",5
I just got this at the black friday sale..... i may have passed it by had i not been in an adventurous mood ( i usually wear brighter colors). it feels wonderful....cozy and silky like expensive pjs!! looks very glamorous yet laid back... i feel like i am in a 40's romantic film.. i got a ps and it fits flowy. it was the only one so i was not able to try the xs. love it! it was cold today so i wore a cami under it with lace peeking thru the low neckline .,5
"I just ordered this dress in blue on sale and it was such a bargain for the quality and look. it's a very comfortable dress that swings and flatters my body type, which is tall and thin. i think this dress would not work on a more busty woman's frame, but it definitely works for me. i'm 5'9 and 135 pounds and a small is plenty big (i often take a medium). i definitely recommend this dress.",5
I own many tiny tops and like other reviews have stated this is a favorite. the ombre design makes it stand out. the embroidery is beautiful. these are usually tops i throw on during my time off/weekends and i have received many compliments on this one. tiny usually runs small but this is true to size or even a size smaller.,5
"I wasn't sure how clingy this dress might be or how it would look on my ""curvy"" body. it's actually really lovely. it runs large but not overwhelming. nice length; above the knee in the front, slightly longer in the back. the colors are really beautiful (i got the darker color). will definitely wear this with a belt, otherwise i think (as other reviewers said) it will be too maternity-looking. i got this at a great sale price!",5
Saw this in the store and loved it! the photos on line do not do this justice. material is soft and substantial. if you love the look of raw edge you'll love this piece. as usual i wish it were a bit shorter even in petites as i am only 5' but kept it and love it.,5
"This looked fabulous on the model, of course, and i love sweater dresses. but even in an xs, i was drowning in fabric and looked ludicrous. concept is good but execution went terribly wrong somewhere. a definite return.",1
I was pleasantly surprised how this dress fit me. very comfortable and flattering on me. love the look. need to watch not to wear anything scratchy as it may pull the fabric,5
"This dress is really beautiful. the material is soft and sways, but it is sweater-like, not flimsy. it does seem to run maybe a little large throughout, but i liked that look. not form-fitting, has more of a drape.",5
"I love this dress. based on reviews, i ordered the small, and the only problem i had was that, while the dress is quite large, the detachable slip lining was quite tight and fitted, which i didn't find comfortable. so i replaced it with a flowy silk slip of my own, and the results are great. the fiber content contains a bit of wool, but i do not find it scratchy to my skin. and i am lovin' the hi-lo aspects of the hem. fun dress for winter!",5
"This is a great addition! it's comfortable, pretty, and can be dressed up and down. most importantly it's slenderizing and a great length for me! i bought it in my regular size, but bought the petite size, noting the model is 5'10"" and where the dress stopped on her. i'm 5'6"". the dress fits perfectly and is a great length for me! it also comes with a lovely, blue slip! such great quality for the price!",5
"Love this dress, i've already worn it many times. i started off with a small but had to go to xs which is smaller than my normal size in order to get the fit as pictured. the length is great and works with tights or boots.

great unique dress!",5
"Another reviewer mentioned this was maternity-ish. i am currently almost 5 months pregnant, and i have to say: this is a wonderful maternity dress, even if that's not what it was made for. when not pregnant, i think this might have been a little overwhelming (and i guess we'll see next year if that's the case for me) -- there is a lot of fabric here. i am usually a small or medium in antrho dresses, and i am wearing a small in this now with room to grow as my stomach grows. the colors on the blu",5
"Originally i bought this in black and white. recently purchased several more in different colorways . why? it's just perfect to wear as an under tank/cami. i'm a busty gal and sometimes cami straps can be too thin and dig into my shoulders. this is soft, smooth and provides just enough coverage. very flattering fit on its own as well. great under loose knit or low cut sweaters. love!",5
Love this tank. material and fit are great. love that it's reversible. highly recommend!,5
"I had my eye on this piece since it came out, but thought it was a little pricier than i like spending... but it finally went on sale. alas, all the petite sizes are gone, but i decided to order the regular xs anyway. (the length quote is long, but i figured maybe with heels?). then the xxs became available and i snatched that too...so glad. the xxs fits better and isn't as long (i have to wear heels, don't get me wrong, but the xs was still long with heels). it is soft and lovely, the xxs linin",5
"I hardly believe i have not reviewed htis yet... so i tried it on in the sotre and was not convinced, my usual xs looked huge and hte ""hip"" part flared out in a funny way. i did, however decide to order it online in petties, to see( i really do love the design in the front, and the hemline is fun and unusual). they didn't have my usual xs so odrdered xxs, just to see... what a great choice, it fits like a glove now and the swaeter is jsut so beautiful... jsut wish it wasn't so pricey, but wil ke",5
"I am an retailer employee, i love this romper and suggested it to several of my regular ladies the day it arrived in our store. they both loved the piece before they tried it on...the jumpsuit is so cute and has the special flair of a piece you would expect to find at retailer. the piece is lined which is an added bonus but there is where the issue with the jumpsuit arrives. the lining is to short makes it feel awkward. i ordered the xxs petite, and it fits perfect, except the inside l",5
"I have the raspberry jumper and i feel like royalty in it. the silk is luxurious and looks expensive. when i walk if feels like it is fluttering around me like butterflies around sleeping beauty. typically i am quite disappointed when trying a jumper and find that what looked amazing on the model simply makes me look goofy. but this one is the exception. i think the super long length (although problematic) as well as the soft elegant drape of he fabric, as well as the angled cut at the bodice ar",5
"Terrible fit for a longer torso.  runs small in hip and lining, huge in the waist.  not good for an hourglass figure!",1
"Just purchased these online and couldn't wait to try them on! they are soft, comfortable and my new favorite pair of jeans! i love them! i am 5'8 and sz. 29...the color and quality are above my expectations :)",5
Beautiful dusty rose color! the fit is fabulous! love the sleeve and hem length! very flattering and does not cling.,5
"Love love this! i was hesitant to buy this at first - the reviews made it seem so big and i wasn't sure if it was my kind of outfit. but i wanted to try a jumpsuit and this was the perfect find! the xs was a typical retailer size for me, so the size was good in this, too. the color is fabulous and the fit is great. the rise is slightly short, but not a problem. i can't wait to where it for my next great event. i wish i could buy it in the black, too.",5
"I am in love with this piece! i am long waisted and large busted so finding a jumpsuit to fit me can be challenging, having said that i sized up when ordering this, wrong ladies....no need....i had to reorder my normal size and even that was roomy, but in a good way as i prefer belting it with my huge concho belts. i purchased it in the rasberry and i am still scratching my head as to why the black sold first, the red is stunning and i find it more versatile going from casual to dressy. and this",5
I just bought this dress and love the fit. i'm pear shaped and it's very flattering! it's not clingy because it is lined and it has great drape. it's also seasonless. it will look great with boots and a sweater or kimono.,5
I ordered this top because it was on a crazy sale and i'm really glad i did. it's super soft and comfortable but still very cute so its versatile. you can wear it down or dress it up with a great skirt or jacket.,5
"My new favorite dress. very flattering beautiful color, and great length. fabric feels very good as well. i'm usually s/m, purchased the medium and it fits perfectly",5
"This jumper is gorgeous! i usually don't instantly spend almost $300 on one piece without contemplating, but as soon as i tried this on, i fell in love. i had to order it online because i needed the xsp as the xs in store was way too big. please be warned that this runs large and definitely buy the petite if you are petite or a little taller... i am 5'3"" for reference and even at 5'3"" it's barely short enough to not be too long on me. so if you are an inch or two taller, i would recommend the pe",5
"Such a gorgeous weight, cut and style! the button detail is adorable and the fit of the sweater is fantastic. the hem style, (not sure what you would call it), is incredibly flattering for an hourglass figure. i am 5'4, 133 and 34dd. fit is tts, maybe a bit large but nothing crazy. love",5
The fabric is super soft and the quality is just exceptional. the pattern/coloring is even more beautiful in person. overall an excellent pair of leggings to work out in or run errands in.,5
"I just got these leggings yesterday and honestly they're amazing. they look just like the picture, feel great on, don't slip in the waist. zero negatives. i can't wait to wear these bad boys out.",5
A little long but very comfortable. i've worn it to work and to a bridal shower so very versatile.,5
"Received this jacket yesterday...and it is lovely.
very well made with a relaxed yet feminine fit.
the cobalt blue accents are not as vivid as they appear online, was slightly disappointed with that, but being more subtle will make it more wearable...so no ""oh she is wearing that jacket again""....
the forest green is rich and elegant.
the fit is true to size, but this is not a fitted jacket, it falls more straight, but the peplum is a gorgeous accent. 
a classic with impeccable quality!",5
"I purchased a large and it fit perfect. i'm a size 12- 36dd. the material is very forgiving and flows over my curves. thick enough that it doesn't need a slip and will stretch to fit size 14 ladies, maybe size 16 too. i'm 5'7"" and the length is great on me with flat sandals. doesn't show my bra either.",5
"I love the beading at the neck of this top and also the half-length banded sleeves. it is a dressy top that is nevertheless very comfortable to wear. it looks like silk although it is synthetic. i do wish it came in a petite length because it is a bit long for me, but it is one of those pieces you can just put on over a variety of pants or skirts and you're done and ready for work or going out to an event. it requires little in the way of accessories because the beading at the neck acts as built",5
"Love this fun print. one of the most complimented items in my closet! i ordered petite after trying on the regular - regular was a bit too long for the look in the models photo. i am 5'5, size 0/2 usually. the blue has faded a little bit the pants have maintained their fun and funky vibe.",5
"I absolutely love these jeans! the rise is mid so it is perfect, not too low and not too high. the embroidered flowers are gorgeous and so unique. these pants scream retailerpolgie to me. i had to buy them as soon as i saw them because i know they will go fast. pilcro denim fits great! i ordered these online as my store didn't have them. i ordered my normal size 26 (2) and they fit great. i have an athletic build and they fit me like a glove with comfy room. i can't wait till the temperature gets",5
"I was looking for a top to wear out that was chic but not too dressy. this top fit the bill. the sleeves and the embellishments give it a very feminine touch. i paired it with skinny black ankle pants and black heels and received lots of compliments. it is comfortable and easy to wear for a long night out. it does run big so i recommend sizing down. also, the sides are slightly sheer but i wore a black tank underneath without a problem. great top!",5
"Love, love, love these leggings! a soft, colorful, comfortable way to show your artistic flare.",5
"Pilcro denim with embellishment like this always wins me over. these pair of jeans fit well, the detail is so pretty for fall. cant wait until it cools off to wear these. the price point is a little high considering the silly shipping costs too. love the jeans though.",5
"I know the photos for this dress show it as a very ""casual"" dress, but i find it very elegant.i really love this dress. it is very simple, but that is what makes it stunning. . the fabric is heavy enough to drape perfectly. it fits really nice on top - my bra fits just fine underneath and doesn't show. i'm a short gal and i will have to wear a small heel even though i purchased an xxs petite. i'm fine with that. nice quality, fits well - done deal for me!",5
I'm in love with these leggings. they are super soft and comfortable. they look cute on and are great for working out or even running errands. very stylish too!,5
Love this top! i typically wear a 4-6 and went with the 6 on this one. the length was better and the the buttons were perfectly closed. i am a 34d. this top looks great with everything.,5
I found this tee to run true to size with a comfortable relaxed fit. the neckline and elegant button gives this tee enough detail to dress it up if you wanted to take it in that direction.,5
Im size 16 top and the xl is a little big but it is a longer tshirt whihc i love thank you sooo much please return the size large back...,5
"Now, i ordered both striped versions and i don't know which to keep... the material is a nice soft knit. the neck line is almost boat-neck, with little buttons, so cute. colors are really nice too. i tried it on with skinnies and trousers,a nd ti looked great with both. i went with the petite version, for those shorter gals out there... xxs petite fit me, i havne't tried o the xs petite yet. (5'1.5"" and 115 lbs). i think it would loke nice with a pencil skirt too, if i only had one that went wit",5
"This is a nice sleeveless button down, the bee design is really fun, but the colors make this more stylish than i would have thought. i tried it on with a pair of white shorts, with a half tuck, and it looked great. i can also see it paired with trousers or flared jeans. nice addition. i purchased the 0 (or xs?) my usual size, in regular length, and it was fine. the stylist also showed me how to tied it in the front to wear with high waisted pants. i am 115 lbs for reference and 30 dd.",5
"I purchased the navy breton stripe version of this shirt. it's chic, versatile, and soft, a great rendition of a wardrobe classic.",5
"Love! i wish this came in additional motifs! hits at hip, i have a long torso, perfect for high rise skinny jeans and sandals.",5
"I bought this mainly because i have a similar one in the mustard colorway and i love how this flows. the color is definitely one you don't see a lot of, which is what makes it special. i could see it running a tad large, but i think it's pretty true to size. now i'm debating about buying it in blush!",5
"I am 5' 4"" and 128 lbs and could have worn the 4 or 6 but took the 6. it does run short and the length in the 6 was better than the 4 with arm hole size being the same. the bees are embroidered making the fabric high quality and normally i would run from a print like this but not this one. it has great style!",5
I really love this dress. i cannot believe how many people have complimented me on this dress and ask where i bought it. the color is so soft and pretty. the dress is comfortable as well. it looks great with a light pair of wedges.,5
"I bought this shirt in the teal/navy and loved it so much that i went back and bought the white/navy too. it is so soft! the shirt runs a little tight but is stretchy and not uncomfortable. the sleeve length and neckline dress up this shirt a little bit from being a standard t shirt, yet it is just as comfortable. overall very cute and flattering.",5
I love the raw edges on this t-shirt and the marled pink is a pretty color. the fit is not as oversized as you might expect from the photos. order your usual size. it's very soft and lightweight.,5
"I tried the red/salmon color on at the store. it's a very bright color, but a nice one. the top is form-fitting, with soft stretchy material. there are two small buttons at each shoulder. the sleeves are a good length. the boatneck shows a little bit of bra strap, but not too noticeable. the only thing i didn't care for was the somewhat synthetic look of the material. if you're between sizes, size up as it's a snug fit.",5
This is so awesome. i love how it fits. it's great quality. it's flattering. it's casual but put together. love. fits true to size. i bought it in white as well.,5
"Beautiful cardigan, but it does run large.  i'm about 5'9"", 160 lbs, normally a large in tops, and the medium fits great. it's still a bit roomy, but i think this cardigan is meant to be a tad roomy.  i agree with another reviewer that it's a bit itchy on bare skin, but it's wool, so that's a given.  overall, a great cardigan for fall!",5
"It's the perfect long, loose t-shirt. flattering without being fitted. love it!",5
"This is such a cute top. i bought it when it was a new arrival and couldn't be more thrilled. it washes well in the the washing machine. the only flaw is that it runs on the short side. otherwise, i'm thrilled.",5
I'm 5'1 and a tad busty and this sweater i found to be most flattering. i saw it i. the store on was drawn to it. i love the shimmer but perhaps that's because the holiday feel is already in the air in nyc. the m fit great in both length pans width. it looked great with my straight black jeans and boots. i felt it made me look thin. thankful i bought it on a discount day! it's a fabulous sweater.,5
Beautiful shirt for a great price. i love a good striped shirt and i got it on sale!,5
So cute! a definite add for this summer. sizing and pattern are both on-point. would be cute with so many bottoms,5
"Beautiful 100% lambswool sweater with all these gorgeous fall colors arranged into an eye catching design. i agree with reviewer numero uno, she is correct on all counts: pretty colors, quality construction, ultra long bell sleeves (look at model wearing cedar/neutral colorway), oversized fit. sizing down will still have those ridiculously long sleeves but i'm fine with that. i ordered size m and will exchange for a s as the cardigan is too large overall. wool is soft and just a bit itchy which",5
"I love this coat. i bought it in 2012, and it still looks great in 2015. i only wear it a few times each season, but it makes me smile. it's tailored, feminine, and a bit flashy. it's fairly warm, too.",5
"Upon entering a local retailer store, i saw this top almost instantly and decided to try it on. 
fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, high waist, 5'3"" (almost), and i normally wear a 12 in a fitted, button-up shirt. i can go down to a 10 in a loose-fit one, but with the buttons i wouldn't expect this to be ""loose-fitting"". i wear a m or l in a knit top. i tried this on in 12, but it was too big in the armholes and chest, causing the top to stand out too much from my body. when i tried on the 10, these",5
"I received this dress today and can not be happier. i'm 5'6"", 120 lbs, 34c, and the 2 fits perfectly, hitting about 1.5"" above my knees. the print is so pretty and elegant. the colors aren't too vibrant, aren't too muted. the collar and french cuffs give the dress an extra flair. it comes with a little slip because the dress is sheer. i just tried it on with suede booties and it looks adorable! i'm ready for cooler temps to arrive so i can wear it!",5
Got the blue & white striped in xs. fits perfectly. the arms are a little snug but it stretched to a comfortable fit. it's very comfy and good quality fabric.,5
"This dress is so much prettier in person! it will be great both for work and play, can't wait to pair with booties into fall.",5
"I got this dress in the mail today, and it's one of the best dresses i've ever gotten at retailer.. the material is of high quality and feels silky against the skin. the fit is true to size for maeve, and is so flattering. for reference, i'm thin (116 lbs), but curvy and usually order a regular xs. in maeve, i'm usually an xsp, and the xsp fit perfectly. it looks good with a wide cream colored crocheted belt (also from retailer), or on its own.",5
"This dress is beautiful and very flattering! i bought the 8 and am 5'3"" and 138lbs. it fits right at the knee and is flowy, but still gives some shape without looking baggy. i love it!",5
"I am busty and have a difficult time wearing stripes because they are not that flattering. the stripes on this top are narrow, and the material is thin which makes this great to wear under a jacket if you want to dress it up. i am 5 feet tall and ordered both the regular small and the ps because i wasn't sure which sleeves would be best on me (as far as the length goes.) if you want the sleeves to look like they do on the model order the petite if that's what you usually order. you can also get",5
"I love this sweater. it is so soft and the pink is such a sweet shade. it is large and falls of the shoulder, but that's how it is designed to fit. it is my new favorite sweater!",5
"I am so happy with this dress. i bought my usual size 2, and it was a perfect fit. this dress is gorgeous. it has some stretch, which is a plus. i am 5'5 "", and it was not too long on me at all. i am so thrilled with my purchase.",5
This dress is more beautiful in person. loved it . fits true to size . i had to return it because it was to long for what i needed.,5
Chic and comfortable even in 90 degree heat. so easy to wear.,5
"Very nice sweater, surprisingly just as pictured color-wise, i ordered a large and it felt true to size in the shoulders, but this sweater flair out to the bottom, you can kind of see it in the photo, the length is good as well for a regular fit. it's very unique combination of fabric acrylic/wool knit, the texture is really nice and soft and looks very good on. also it's thick and warm. i wore the top to work today on 34 degree weather and received many compliments. sweater looks simple but the",5
"I bought this lightweight duster in the cream color. it runs a little large through the shoulders so i sized down from my usual l to a size m. its very flattering on, and made with natural fibers such as cotton and linen. i wear this unbuttoned with a tank top, cropped jeans, and sandals.",5
"I'm 5.5"", 128 lbs, 34b cup, slender throughout, size 2 fit perfectly. lightweight, flattering dress. bought on sale to wear next year to baby/bridal shower type event.",5
"I just received this dress and i feel like a goddess in it! it is perfect for graduations, weddings, romantic dinners, tropical va cations....heck, i'll wear it to the grocery store! i love it that much!

i am 5'7"" with a 34c bust.....i have this dress in a size 4 and it fits very well. this dress is slim cut from the shoulder down to the waist. the dress length hits me at the lower calf, just like the model online. i think the armholes are cut a little high...this being said; this dress would",5
"This sweater works on many levels for petite frames. the length is just right, hitting at the lower waist. the design is very pretty, feminine and with flair.",5
"I wanted this top since the first time i saw it. it fits perfectly in a small, as i usually wear a small or medium. it would probably fit better if you are smaller on top -i am a 36a- as it is not generously sized. it flares at the bottom, which looks quite flattering. the lace on the sleeves really adds a lot of style. i will wash it carefully, as i am not sure how well the lace will hold up with washing. this is a beautiful top, and i am considering buying another in a different color. i think",5
"This dress was so cute and comfortable! i said it runs big, but i think that may also simply be the style of it. i paired it with some cute boots and received many compliments! love it!!",5
This sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest. it's very well made but not for the curvy girl. this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others' reviews before i purchase.,1
"I've been searching high and low for a pair of flattering and comfortable linen pants. i'm very particular and have turned down every pair until these. these are perfect! they fit true to size. they are a relaxed, but not baggy cut. (i hate saggy butt pants!) the legs are slightly tapered so they don't widen my frame. they look great rolled up or left down. the linen is soft, not scratchy. the elastic band sits comfortably on my waist. they are also not see through! (a must for me!) i ordered th",5
"Yay hei hei! love these pants. thanks to the roll-up, they show a nice bit of ankle. lightweight but sturdy?i've been reaching for them when it just seems too hot for jeans. they're a little poufy toward the top (below the waist), but the tie waist makes them sufficiently cinchable. i expect to get a lot of wear out of these this summer. i did experience some stretching/sagging after a full day of walking, moving, and sitting, so i bought my second pair in m instead of l. (got navy and went back",5
"Recently wore this lovely dress during business trip - was stopped four times while walking thru orlando airport. the design is extremely comfortable, the print will make you and others smile. so elegant and fun. the beading on the flowers is elegant. such a unique piece",5
"Buy these, they are a keeper. sturdy fabric, not too thin and they do not sag or stretch after wearing (i tested them before taking the tag off by sitting in them on my couch for several hours). comfy, soft fabric. i will be ordering other colors, hoping that black will be available.",5
These pants look nice and are comfortable but the quality of the fabric is terrible! i should not be surprised because i bought another pair of pants by this same label at antro earlier this year and they did not hold up at all either. but i thought i'd give it another shot. never again! i'm on my 5th wear and the crotch and inner thighs have worn away completely...i mean huge holes in the fabric where it's just disintegrated. even at extra % off the sale price it's not worth it. the full price,1
"This is simply a fabulous dress. i think the issue with the other reviewers is that they are too small (though there is nothing wrong with that). i am not. i am older and heavier, and the dress fits very well. i'm also rounder on the bottom so it is not baggy or tent-like. the material and texture of the yarn is soft and comfortable. you can wear it all day at the office and into the evening. it looks great with a jean jacket, for example, and booties. and it also looks terrific with flats. it d",5
"This dress is a lovely creation! however, i had to buy it three times before finding the proper fit. it runs extremely large!! i am 5'4"", weighing around 128. i ordered a 4 petite the first time because others stated this dress ran small. ha! it was a sack!!! the 2 petite was little better. the 0 petite was perfect! but i have never worn a 0 petite in my entire life!

otherwise, this dress is an original that i will enjoy for many years to come! if only it had been made of silk, it would be un",5
"I ordered this dress in navy for fall, and it is now easily the most darling and figure flattering dress in my wardrobe. i am 125 lbs and size 27 in jeans. i usually wear a size small but ordered a medium based on reviews that said this dress runs small, and i like that the medium is a little longer and slightly blousy, making it more modest, but the small would have worked just fine for a slightly more figure-accentuating look. the fabric hangs beautifully and has a silky feel. the navy flower",5
"I bought this sweater in the black. it is so flattering and feels great on. the sleeves are a bit long, but they are supposed to be. the material is not overly thick, yet it feels soft and well made. while the lace sleeves are the star of this show, the back is so flattering! it has a perfect cut that i don't think comes through in the picture. it fits true to size. love this one!!!!",5
"It is rare that i find a pair of pants that works for me at retailer. as a woman with curves i have found that most of retailer's pants are cut for slim figured women, this rare pair of pants crosses the divide, flattering both shapes. i usually have to look for xls. here, i found that i had too much room and sized down to a l. these pants are great. they are lightweight without being so gauzy that they highlight imperfections. they will be my go to summer pant. i love them.",5
"It's stunning in person. delicate beading detail on bodice isn't visible in the photo but really dresses it up. fits lovely but runs small. i am usually a 6 or 8, ordered the 8 and it just fits. fully lined. bought it to attend a wedding and i'm very pleased with it.",5
"I love drop shoulder sweaters and find them to be very flattering so i took a chance on this one despite the reviews stating it runs very large. i was attracted to the style as well as the natural cotton fiber, which i find holds up best over time. i am 34b and usually wear xs or small and in this i ordered the xs. it fits perfectly! i layered this soft pink sweater over a rounded hem tee with a black and white pattern; so cute! it is slightly short on my 5'8"" frame so the shirt tail hems peeked",5
"I've been looking for comfortable pants for the summer.  this pants is the answer.  it's comfortable, thin, and yet not to sheer.  this pants a bit loose, i could fit in s.  i usually buy size 8 or 10 for shorts from retailer, so i'll say this pants run big.  the con with this pants is the stitching around the back pockets is not very sturdy.  i found tiny holes on 2 other pairs before i bought mine.",5
"I bought this is in the gray color, although imo it has more of a greenish hue. i love it. it's a wide boxy fit like others have said, and tends to fall off the shoulder. i purchased it in the small (my typical size) and it definitely seems to run large (it relaxes too as i wear it, giving it an even roomier feel). that said it's very cozy & comfortable. i wear a tank underneath. works well for 50's and 60's weather.",5
"This is a perfect sweater. it's comfortable, practical and lends an elegant hand to a pair of jeans. it also hides your bits and stays flattering. i have worn it a lot because it makes life so easy and i have not had any issues yet with lace tearing.

"Bummer, i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.",1
"These pants are so great, light, comfortable and reasonably priced. they are very well made, and the soft fabric is perfect for summer traveling and hiking. there's a bit of elastic in the waist which i like since pants usually gap at the waist on me. they're like classier lounge pants.",5
"Don't wait. get this dress now before it disappears. it is gorgeous, it is well made. it is like butter. the fit is perfect and the workmanship is stunning. everything about this screams, ""lets go party!."" oh yeah... and the skirt part kind of swishes around as you dance. you cannot get more charming than this.",5
This is a gorgeous sweater! i purchased it in black and purple.,5
"I bought this dress to wear to my graduation where i was receiving a degree in horticulture. i also just had a child a few weeks prior and was worried about sizing. the high waist worked well for the post pregnancy belly. i am 5'3"" and was typically around 130 lbs pre-pregnancy which was typically a 4 in dresses. i ordered a 6 petite in this dress and it was perfect! the only area that was sort of tight was the bosom but i am nursing so i expected as much. the petite length was perfect for my he",5
"Absolutely beautiful, i am extremely happy with this purchase. i bought this top a couple of months ago and have worn it many times. initially, i was a little apprehensive to order due to some of the other reviews but i found that this top is very figure flattering. it is very soft and warm and i am positive it will be in my wardrobe for quite a few years to come. i am almost sad that i will have to put it away for the season soon.",5
"I loved the look and style of the dress but was unsure how it would work with my body. i'm curvy but slim and usually a size 6 or 8 in retailer. i went with the m in the navy color, and i'm happy i did! 
the floral pattern is vibrant and the ruffled skirt is flirty and fun. as far as fit goes, i'd say this runs mostly true to size but is rather short in length. i have a large chest so the top part looked more baggy than blousy, and the skirt portion was just comfortably fitted. however, the cuten",5
This sweater is even better looking in person. the body of the sweater is substantial - a nice weight. the lace is gorgeous. i usually wear a size large but found the sleeves really long. i purchased a medium and it fits better - sleeves are perfect.,5
"Love the lace cut out detail on the sleeves which is initially what attracted me to this sweater. just be careful with the threads. the sleeves are long but are supposed to be, as in the photo. comfortable material with nice weave, flattering cut. i bought the ivory color in xs for my 5'2"" 115 # straight frame. not too long",5
"Love, love, love this sweater. it is so comfy and well made. this is a piece i will have for a very long time. the beautiful lace detail are the sleeves are to die for. picture doesn't do this sweater justice.",5
Love love love!!! it is a little boxy but it is soo soft and comfortable!! it does run at least a size or 2 big!! i picked it up in the pink color yesterday at me local retailer store. was not sure about it when i first saw it online but fell in love with it quickly when i tried it on!!  great sweater for fall/winter,5
I purchased the pale green in this sweater first. loved it so much i purchased in another color.,5
Stunning sweater for cooler weather. i think it runs a little small so returned first one and ordered one size up which fits perfect.,5
I ordered the navy in an xl although am generally a medium or large in tops. i sized up because it looked fitted and i think it was a good choice for me. it fits just like the model but the back droops a bit and the neck is wider. my bra is still covered in the back.  it fits perfectly in the waist and the elastic allows for some adjustment in placement. there's 2 layers of ruffles in the skirt portion. i'm 66 and was concerned it would be too young looking but i love the look. it hits about an,5
I wanted to love this dress but sadly returned it.  i think it would be more appropriate for someone younger.  it runs very large but its not clingy so forgiving of anyone with chunkiness (such as myself).  i guess i just thought the blue was a little too unexciting (for me).,5
"Wore this & got many compliments. true to size, elegant.",5
"These pants are really great! the fabric is soft, but substantial, and the fit is so comfortable. i bought the ""grey"" color - it's a very light grey, almost a stone color. it's a perfect neutral to wear with just about any top you may have. i love the deep front pockets and the elastic waist is an added bonus. i'm 5'5"", 124 lb. and purchased the small.",5
"I already have some dresses similar to this, but i couldn't help getting this one, too. i love the flowers, bees, and ladybugs on the print! there is some shimmery beading on the neck and a few spots. i think i can wear this at work with the right cardigan/jacket, so i'll get more use out of it. it's a lovely light, floaty fabric that's nice for warmer weather.",5
"I felt a review would be helpful for anyone between sizes. i am long, lean, and broad shouldered. i normally wear a m, but ordered a l. it still fits snug, so i've exchanged for an xl in order to get the drape, as pictured on the model. material and color of the red motif is darling; light as a feather & will take me spring through summer.",5
"Slouchy, longer in the sleeves, a little cropped, great neckline, stylish.....these are just some of the reasons i absolutely love this sweater! i've been looking for a style like this for a long time. i went down a size because of the wide neckline and the fact that it is a bit oversized. i'm petite, 119 lbs., with a 32f bust size. i went with the grey, but i'm loving it so much i might pick one up in the pink. so comfy and cozy and chic!!",5
Beautiful sweater. i first bought it in black and loved it so much i bought it in burgundy. the burgundy one is longer and slightly bigger than the black one and they are both smalls. nice thing is i can wear the burgundy one with leggings. love the lace on the sleeves and the sweater is a nice weight.,5
"Very high quality fabric and the fit is excellent. the skirt is stylish yet simple and very easy to wear as i feel i would have no trouble paring it with several different tops. it can easily be dressed up or down and is excellent for work. i got this on sale and am so glad, still, it is one of the few items actually worth the initial high price tag. great quality!",5
"These pants are so comfy i'm getting a second pair. i ordered the olive color in a small/reg, im thinking of ordering the xs next time since they do stretch out a great deal as the day goes on. would definitely recommend these for sure. hope this review is helpful as i struggled with ordering petite or not. glad i didn't!",5
"These are nice, comfortable summer pants that travel well. the material has a nice feel to it,lightweight, but not too thin. they are easy to wear with any summer top, and look just dressy enough. i like the elastic waist, but the pants will stretch out a bit, and run a little large.",5
I bought this dress in burnt orange for my 19 year-old collage daughter. she loved it and has found many opportunities to wear it on campus. she said it is so comfortable and perfect with a sweater for cool fall mornings and sleeveless as the day warms up.,5
Love this romantic girlie girl dress. so pretty.,5
"I bought this duster in the blue color and really like it. i am 5'11"" so love the longer length. the large was too wide so got the medium. the sleeves were a little snug on my upper arms but after wearing it for awhile they loosened up. i think i will get the white too!",5
"I love this turtleneck! it's soft (cashmere blend), is sexy with the lace design and loose but form fitting style, and the 70s inspired sleeves are really flirty. i purchased it in two colors because i got so many compliments the first time around!",5
"I bought this dress at my local retailer store on friday and love it! the dress is well made, with some heft to the yarn. the colors of the yarn, blue, white and grey, seem to shimmer a bit due to their weave, but there is no metallic thread in the dress that i can tell. i know some have written that the dress is a sack, but not on me. i toyed with buying this online and then didn't due to the negative comments about the dress; i bought an extra small and it fits well (i usually where an x small,",5
"I love this cotton weave shift dress. it is supposed to be loose and not tight. i purchased a medium and fits the way i see it should fit. ref: 34dd, 148 lb; 5'4 height. hits above the knee but office appropriate as not too short. i paired it with a few seasons ago, the navy blue suede fringe jacket by retailer elevenses; new necklace in the blue motif from retailer ( it has a hanging druzy pendant) navy hose and navy crew neck long sleeve top.  great outfit for work and an after work party at retailer",5
"The sleeves on this top always caught my eye every single time i was in a store. they never had my size to try on, so when a free shipping offer came up, i ordered the ivory top in a size large. well, the sleeves are indeed stunning, but that is all that is attractive about this top! the rest was a plain, blank, white canvas. in fact, that's what it felt like to wear it -- like i was wearing a tent or an artist's canvas on my chest. yuck! how can this designer put so much thought and care into t",1
"I went with my usual size, but it is too tight, it fits, but i would feel uncomfortable in it. i ordered the pink one, which looks nice in the picture, but in person, it looks cheap. the beading at the neckline immediately looked to me like cocktail dresses my grandma used to wear in the 1970s. that beaded neckline added to the cheap look. this one is not for me.",1
I love the look on this dress - feels great for a romantic night out or for a party.,5
"I almost never buy anything full price here and usually wait patiently for a sale + promotion :) however, this really struck me and i decided to buy it, telling myself it's an investment piece for years to come. it's just so unique and beautiful -- the things that makes retailer unique that aren't as common anymore.

"For the last two years, i have only purchased clothing for myself if it is secondhand, but then i saw this skirt and succumbed to temptation. first of all, the print is gorgeous! i'm a sucker for blue and white anything so it wasn't that hard of a sell. as other reviewers have mentioned, the seams line up! this kind of quality is so hard to find in clothing items anymore and really makes the skirt seem much more pricey than it really is (if you're buying it on sale like i did). i'm 5'3"" and will",5

"I went back and forth on whether to purchase this dress, and i'm so glad i did. the fit was perfect. i'm always a little hesitant about long dresses since i'm 5'2"", but the petite length was perfect. the quality is great and the dress is so comfortable, but i feel elegant in it. i wore it for rehearsal dinner at my wedding and plan on wearing it again for a wedding next month.",5
"This is a beautifully made sweater. i bought this sweater in ivory yesterday; i wore it today and received many compliments. i think the sweater is adorable. it?s soft and warm; the neck is perfect, i like that it?s not as restrictive as a turtleneck. the long sleeves add character and help to make it interesting. i highly recommend it?i?m looking for a black one,",5
"This is a dress for a princess. i admire this dress so much, online and in person. i tried on this dress a few times every time i visited the store. the beads throughout the dress provide a low-key surprise sparkle, especially in the sun. the colors are much more vibrant in person, which is breathtaking against the light cream background. the fabric is soft and flowy. unfortunately for me, it doesn't fit right. size 6 fits well but the arm holes are too big and the midi part makes me look frumpy",5
"I'm a 12/14 and i got a large and the dress fits nicely through the hips/seat. i'm kind of pear shaped so it's a bit large through the top, but i intend to layer another knit top under it so that's ok. 
 i didn't want the knit dress to be too tight or else it would stretch out after sitting. i like the colors and the fabric. the weave is loose and after snagging it on my glasses taking it off i'm careful with it. it will be nice into fall with a sweater.",5
"My daughter got this dress in the 10 and i got it in the 6 - we are both tall. also, she's a redhead and got the butterfly version and i'm blonde and got the pink. also, both of us are small-chested - and since there is no give in the fabric, i don't know where one would fit boobs if you have them. one thing i noted (and i am not happy about) is that the back is puckered up along the zipper. this has to be on purpose, and i don't really understand that detail, as it doesn't flatter me and it loo",5
"I am a fan of these designers and their gorgeous fabrics - most of which are heavy brocades. this is so pretty and fun. the print is playful, and colors are gorgeous, and the fit is floaty but not too full or too tight. i love the bit of beading, and that i can dress it up or down.

i am petite and not usually a bigger print or long dress fan, but i know that i will wear this one for years. 

i did get a 00 petite as i know that only this small size fits me at retailer - 0's swallow me. this i",5
"I ordered this in a 2, but returned for a 4 because the arm holes were a little tight. other than that, this is a absolutely flattering dress. u will be wearing it for an outdoor garden wedding shower. the beading around the flowers makes such a different accent. just be careful zipping it up. love it!",5
"This a a great sweater! it is classic, but has the fun surprise element of the lace bell sleeves. loved it so much i got the black and the sea mist. looks great with jeans or leggings! the only negative is you can call it that is that the sleeves are a tad long for me. compliments everytime i wear!",5
"I love the way this dress fits and flows! it does run big. i normally wear size 6 in retailer dresses. had to downsize to 6p. for reference, i'm 5'10"" and 34c. the pink color is 1 shade darker than shown in the pictures.there was a tear in fabric along the zipper. called for replacing the dress. the sales rep was very pleasant & agreed to send another one!",5
"I debated buying this, so glad i did. tts. i'm 5'5"" 115 and 32c. i got size 2, and it worked but i could have done a 0 (which is my usual size). i was afraid to order it too small because i needed it right away! this dress is gorgeous! i got the pink color way and it is more vibrant in person. the beading is beautiful, it's incredibly soft and flowy! this dress is probably my favorite dress ever! if you're on the fence, order it!",5
"I got this in blue and i love it! it skims your curves without being clingy, and it is very comfortable. i was hesitant to buy this, but it's surprisingly flattering! it will be perfect with heels for early fall, then worn with a long sleeve shirt and boots when the temperatures dip. my only caution is that it is shorter than it appears in this photo. it falls well above my knees, and i am shorter than the model. regardless, i am thrilled with my purchase!",5
"I loved these pants and purchased them in three colors. like another reviewer, within a few weeks, having worn them no more than a couple of times, the fabric in the crotch area started to wear thin and two pairs developed holes. i was not hard on the pants - just wore them to the office - and line dried them. so disappointing, as i really did love the pants. total waste of money.",1
"I had purchased the black color of this sweater at full price and loved it so much that when i saw the burgundy color go on sale i knew i had to have it! this sweater is very comfortable and elevates any look with its lace down the sleeve, mock neck collar, and slightly flared silhouette. it's so fun to find different shirts to wear underneath to get a whole new look. highly recommend, would have gotten all colors!",5
Love this sweater. it fits true to size. fun and different. purchased 30% off but i don't think the price it terrible depending on your clothing budget.,5
"I had high hopes ordering this top...unfortunately the top has a metallic fiber to the material and that detail was not noted in the product description! it also felt rather cheap & scratchy, poor quality for the price.",1
"So there weren't any product reviews to go by when i ordered the last small. i had no way of knowing if it ran big, small, or tts. i'm usually a med, but to my surprise the small worked due to the fluid pleating. it sits right on my natural waistline similar to the model and not too short in length (i'm 5'8""). i also like the med weight of the fabric it moves freely when you walk, but not too light. it is similar to a double weight georgette or crepe.",5
"After reading the other reviews i still took a chance on ordering this dress becasue it looks so cute on the model. the dress they sent me is not this dress. it is the same material although the one i received had only one stripe down the canter, like a cross. there was no v back as stated by the other reviewer. it was scoop and if you pulled it down, the neck went up. the dress i received is branded as holding horses while the brand listed on here, is rava. the length measured at 39"" not the st",1
"Great basic skirt to have.  it flows beautifully and the print is a classic with a twist.  it can be dressed up or down, with heels or flats.  a great addition to my wardrobe!",5
"I love this piece! like another reviewer i did notice a broken button right out of the package but it was so great in every other way that i'm going to keep it and have that mended and the buttons reinforced.

i'm 5' 7, 140, generally a size 8/medium, small frame on top but baby growing hips ;) -- i found it tts",5
"I love the lace on this top, it's perfect. it's great for my shape, i'm
so happy with this purchase.",5
"I've been buying from retailer for the last 15 years and this is the first time i've ever posted a bad review. first of all the fabric is scratchy, thin, and looks very cheap. second of all there is no v back, it's more of a slight scoop. and lastly i'm 5'3"" so i ordered the petite small and it's still comes 4 inches below my knee. i am very disappointed in the quality and am definitely sending back. the only thing i think this could possible good for is a swim coverup.",1
"I love clothing that has little surprises, and i love the detailing at the arms with the lace-like openings which is not very characteristic (and actually quite fancy) for a typical henley. i found the fabric to be medium weight-and thought the quality was fine. i like all of the colors this comes in-each would fit into my wardrobe nicely. i have gotten into comfortable clothing (that is still flattering and functional) lately and am on a huge kick of gravitating toward it. this top certainly is",5
This is a beautiful dress and fits well. the embroidery is delicate and can snag easily.,5
"Got this in the petite xs in mint; the color is gorgeous, it's a really bright mint that complements my super fair skin really well (though it would work for pretty much any skin tone). it's still a good length in the petite for the type of shirt it is (5'1 and hits right around my lower hips). it is a thinner fabric, but that's what i was expecting, and the lace detailing at the bottom of the sleeves is a nice touch and makes it more than just a plain henley.",5
"These socks are soft and comfortable, and they are very short so they'll be good with booties. i couldn't tell from the pictures but the pale gray dots are surrounded by a border of subtle silver thread. they're adorable!",5
"I had my eye on this for a while and finally picked it up on sale. i got the darker blue in xs. great piece, fits well. very cozy but the cuffs add such cute detail.",5
"I found this top to be very beautiful and well made.
the fabric is on the lighter side, however for me that is a double plus.
it is great for layering with a cami underneath and/or a heavier sweater on top.
and going towards spring it extends wearing time.
the lace on the sleeves is beautiful and a pretty peek a boo effect if layered under another sweater.
it 's a subtle sexy top with endless possibilities.
i found it runs very true to size.
i purchased the aqua and after receiving it i rushed t",5
These are nice jeans for the price. they are tight at first but do stretch out so i am glad i went with my normal denim size and didn't size up. i wish they didn't have a button fly but it didn't bother me enough to return them.,5
"I love these jeans but be advised that they run a little small in the waist. they work for me but i think they'd work best on those with an hourglass shape. i'm 5'7"" and about 112 lbs with a small waist and i wear a 28 in these. but i have hips - the 28 fits perfectly since it has a small waist but accommodates my hips. i love these jeans. great fit, good fabric, great price!",5
"This is the most beautiful dress i've ever owned. the detail is exquisite. i never write reviews and felt i had to for this dress. i love it!

the embroidery does catch on the beading so you have to handle it carefully. it's worth the special treatment, though!",5
"I was checking out at my local retailer when one of the salespeople held up this top and said someone had just returned it.  they were talking about how cute it was (they didn't have it in the store).  i asked what size it was and it was a medium, so i said i want to try it on.  after trying it on, i fell in love, it is so cute, the cut fit great.  it is a little big but the small might have been too snug in the bust.  if you are in between sizes, you can probably size down.  i wore it yest",5
"Love polkadots, love sparkle. these little socks are perfect for booties.",5
I love this top. i had no issues with fabric. it is soft and light. the wrist details are very pretty. i love the buttons. it fits true to size and it is a good layering top. i got the red which is true to the picture. not looking red but a bright coral color.,5
"This coat is simply beautiful. i love the slits on the sides, it makes it unique and sexy. i would suggest that you go up a size so the silhouette is not disturbed by any pulling or tugging. i'm so happy with my purchase!",5
I love these little socks ? and the dots sparkle. i wear them with my heels and leggings or jump suit pants when i don't want a higher sock or knee-high stockings.,5
"I've been looking for a light colored flowy cardigan for awhile and finally found this one is perfect. the materials is soft and has just the right about of details for me with the gently ruffled edges, tie front an some bunching around the sleeves. color is between ivory and tan. i am petite height and medium framed with broad shoulders and since they didn't have petite in stock, i bought regular s. it fits well enough, though i probably could have bought an xs. my new favorite card!",5
"This skirt is definitely not what i was expecting. the material is stiff and rough. the skirt is also loud. you can hear it swishing when you move, and not in a classy way. it feels like you're wearing a very long tutu. also, the pattern isn't quite as pretty in person. they must have used magic in order to make this skirt look flowy in the photos - it does not flow.",1
"Had a feeling when i saw this that it would be a great top. love the way the elasticized neck hugs tightly and has two little back buttons. the beading is elegant and subtle. the body flows nicely, not overly billowy. definitely true to size. interesting ocher color; a yellowy-green. this is one to own.",5
It's a soft comfy fabric... cute ruffle... may be a little on the bigger side but still super cute! very form fitting but still fits true to size imo the olive color is even more beautiful in person!,5
"Adorable dress, amazing fit!",5
"I absolutely love this cardigan! it is so soft and goes with anything. it can be dressed up or down. it is definitely my new ""go to"" for airplane travels. highly recommend!!",5
"I saw online and bought in white and moss! moss is darker in person. i am 106, 5'1 but a 30f and the top fits very well. it actually minimized my chest which i love! not sure how well this would fit on small-chested ladies. not super clingy in the midsection but will look nice with pants or skirts. super happy!",5
"What a great purchase! love this vest. i live in pa and i see myself wearing this sweater for 3 seasons, which i love. great details, length, and knit. true to size",5
"To start: i'm 135 lbs, 5'7"", 34c, 28 jeans, size 4 dress -- amazing skirt for an outstanding price! incredibly lightweight; has a stretchy-jersey lining. to fit high-waisted like the model, go down 1-2 sizes. in work slacks, i wear a size 6 or 8. however, my natural waist is small. i tried on the size 2 and the size 4. i purchased the size 2, although i still wish there was a size 0 to try on. a larger size will fit lower at the waist and will bring the midi length to ankle length.",5
"I'm always looking for something that is unique and can be layered. this looks just like it does on the model. you'll need a cami underneath as it is not lined. a little shorter in front than in the back but drapes nicely. styled it with black denim ankle jeans, black loafers (or boots), and a blue denim jacket. i'm 118#, 34d, 5'4"" and the s fit well.",5
Overall very pretty.,5
Love this sweater. i wore it to work with leggings and a long sleeved shirt underneath. it lays nicely.,5
"These joggers are so comfortable. nice and lightweight and fabric is very soft and a bit stretchy, so they move with you. beautiful dark navy/indigo print, very subtle and blends well with many tops. perfect length (i am 5'3"", 116 lb. and purchased xs). love them!",5
"This dress is so beautiful it makes me feel like a goddess, lol. i'm normally a 10/12 or m/l and took a 12. i think the 10 would have worked too. everything from the colors, fit and flow of the dress is wonderful. i didn't have any problem with there being too much fabric as some of the reviews mentioned.",5
"Love, love, love this skirt. perfect for the holidays but it can also be dressed down. pair it with gold, burgundy, black or a more casual chambray jean shirt. a great price point and i was able to grab it when it was 20% off.",5
I can't say enough about this jumpsuit. within 1 hour of wearing this shopping i had 4 compliments from strangers.   it is flattering. pretty. soft. comfortable. love love love,5
Purchased this top in navy blue. it is versatile. appropriate for the office and to go out. i specifically like the look with white jeans. it looks put together. the quality is good and there are several nice detsils in the design. highly recomnend it.,5
"This skirt is unique yet versatile and gorgeous. everything about this skirt works: dazzle balanced out with softness and midi length. the twirly width shows off the skirt in a subtle way, and super comfortable. no petite 2 left so i purchased a regular 2 and it fits perfectly (i am 5ft2in, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls about 2in. longer than shown on the model. this skirt is sold out fast, no surprise. it flatters all body types at all ages. get ready for lots of compliments!",5
This top is my favorite of the season! planning to order in black too.,5
"This sweater is the bomb. it's soft, flattering, and looks good with everything. i ordered a second one to have when this one gets worn out!",5
"I love this sweater. it's sort of like a tunic and sort of like a vest. i am pairing it with leggings and a white long sleeve tee underneath. i'm 5'3"" 109 lbs and the xs fit very well. i love the versatility and design of this.",5
These leggings run true to size. the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch. i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be.,5
Very cute top but it is wide and runs large. it is very flattering with skinny jeans and the color is a beautiful navy almost a hint of purple. i would consider a size down. may run on the short side for those with longer torsos.,5
"I love this top! it's well-made (important if you're in chlorine or salt water) and has vibrant colors. the back strap has two clasp options, so not much room for adjustment but i like this fastening method because you don't have a big bow to lay on when laying out.",5
This sweater/jacket is great over any blouses. love the color. it looks more slightly peachy cream color that i love! goes with everything. warm. i thought it ran true to size. i ordered a small and love the way it fits. if you are looking for more of an oversized piece then you would need to size up.,5
Love this top. fits me perfect. i am bigger on top and received many compliments in this shirt.,5
"I went to the store to try on a jumpsuit and ended up with these instead. while the jumpsuit was really cute, i thought these would be more versatile. as far as i can tell they are the same style as the pradollano tapered loungers by hei hei. these were so cute and comfy i bought both. they can easily be dressed up with a jacket and heels or worn casually with a tee and sandals. i think these are much cuter in person than online. there is a little red design in the pants which is hard to see in",5
"My new favorite. i purchased the ivory in a medium, and the lilac in a large when it went on sale (medium was already sold out). i'm 5'7"" and about 125 pounds, 34c give or take. the medium fits great, and i found the large only slightly bigger, but it does not look too big. i usually wear a small or medium in most retailer sweaters.
as was previously noted, the back is cut higher than pictured. i actually like this, as it gives the sweater a unique look. i tend to layer with a button down for the",5
"So comfortable, fit just right, flattering, beautiful neutral color, but different, love the embroidery, nothing bad about it. that being said, i haven't worn them the whole day, i suspect they will stretch a bit. also have not washed them, so i hope the color stays the nice rich dark gray turquoise, the length is perfect too, i ordered the petite and they fit as on the model (for a change, i have pretty short legs). (115 lbs, 26.5 in waist, muscular legs)",5
"Super cute, well made, great embroidery. waist runs big.",5
"This top runs large. i am usually a medium in retailer but when i read the first review, i ordered a small, and it was the right decision. i also agree that this top might be short for someone with long torso. love the back detail and the print and color is really nice!",5
"Love this dress! the light fabric quality, color, and design all added to the grecian goddess feeling! my usual 0 fit perfectly, giving me a great shape and the length is great!",5
"This dress has rich color, excellent quality fabric and wonderful style. you can wear it now for fall with boots and jean jacket or in the summer for a great sun dress.",5
"Love the muted pattern in the blue and spots of gray, front and back. i wore this with my gray legging/pants. the pleats allow for a relaxed fit; very comfortable over all.",5
Love this top!! fits perfectly & it's lovely,5
"These joggers are super cute and comfortable in addition to being stylish.  they have beautiful colors and design. if these were presented in other colors, i would buy those as well. 5,5 135. small fit perfectly.",5
"Recently bought these on sale, though they were still a bit in the expensive side. i'm 5'2"" and typically a size 4, the xs fits perfectly. the pants fall to my ankle and are not cropped as they are on the model, but i'm fine with that. the piping on the seams helps them not seem too much like pajamas, and i was particularly pleased that the crotch was not too baggy, as sometimes happens with this style.",5
"I purchased these leggings to match the top pictured with the outfit. i love the top, and i wanted to love the leggings since the combination of the top with the leggings has fantastic style. alas, the straps around the ankle got bunched because my legs are just not long enough. even though these are very comfortable leggings, i will be returning the leggings due to the length issue.",5
"These wanderer pants are my go to. i love the patch pocket styling. they are true to size, but seem to stretch, so buy a size down. trust me, it will work.",5
"I was not sure if they would be flattering with the waistband, but i love them. they feel wonderful, yet they are so light. perfect for warm weather. the print takes them from day to night.",5
"I love the colors. however, $200 is a lot to pay for a small piece of fabric , no lining what so ever. the fabric is very thin. you will need a slip. looks just like a cover-up. going back.",1
"I was a bit nervous ordering this dress because it had so much going on, but i have to say, it's beautiful on! it's stretchy and super comfortable as well. i usually struggle with tight pencil like dresses, but this is stretchy and super comfy! no riding up on me! i cannot say enough good things about this dress, it's just so flattering and i get so many compliments when i wear it.",5
"This dress is more beautiful in person.
this dress fits well on top for my broad shoulders, chest(40c)and through my straight hips. note. the side bottom panels are very stretchy. i will have it tailored slimmer. so if you are bottom curvy, this dress is awesome!",5
"I was in trouble when i saw this dress in the new arrivals section this month! it's one of those dresses i had to have for the holidays. i didn't want to risk it not fitting so i ordered my usual size 6 and also a size up, 8. (5'6"", 135lbs, size 6) well the 6 was entirely to tight, i couldn't even zip past my rib cage. the 8 went on, but it was very body con looking! hugged every curve! this might be the look some might be going for, but not me!! i'm so disappointed that i can't have the dress f",5
"Every byron lars dress that i have is definitely beyond ordinary and this one is no exception. i love the petals that adorn the front.  my dress was back ordered for a couple of months but it was well worth the wait. i wore it recently and received compliments galore. if you're undecided about this one, go for it!!!  it's a winner.",5
"I bought this dress on a whim one day, even though i wasn't sure where i would wear it, but i just had to have it. this dress fits beautifully, and is very flattering. i am 5'9 and typically a size 14 with large hips, behind, and a smaller waist. the 12 fit me very well--snugged in all the right places and just right everywhere else. i ended up wearing this to a benefit and i received many compliments. go for it!",5
"I have the ""charisma sheath"" by the same designer and love it so much i thought i'd try this one. looks so much better in person than in the picture. it's extremely flattering on my curve less frame. whenever i wear it to work, i get stopped and asked where i got it. great dress, you'll love it more in real life!",5
"I love this dress. the pattern/print is very different than most of the dresses i own. i'm 5'1"" 106lbs and the 0p fit perfectly. it's a delicate dress. its very fitted in the skirt portion. the top is more of a knit fabric that has some give to it.",5
"I wore this to my retirement party; i wanted something special for a once in a lifetime event. i wanted something that was dressy, while also being unique so i wouldn't look like everyone else. almost without exception, from my boyfriend to everyone i talked with, mentioned my dress. the design is so unique, making me feel even more special on my special day. it's beautiful, yet comfortable. the stretchy sides made it feel snug without pinching or discomfort. really a fun dress to wear. i'm sure",5
"I was very shocked to receive this dress with a rusty zipper, looks like crusty white rust . see attached pictures. the dress fabric is very nice and i did try it on and it is a very nice fit, lined with a little stretch but my gosh what a cheap poor quality zipper that looks like it was old and exposed to moisture because the metal parts have a white crusty substance! retailer you really need to check your merchandise before sending to your loyal customers. lately the quality has been declining a",1
"This is my first romper and i am in love.  so comfortable and easily dressed up or down.  i am usually an xs, small, or petite small in retailer brands.  the xs worked best for me.  the petite small was too big.  i am 5'2"" and the length of the xs is perfect ankle length.  i was nervous to put it in the washer on delicate cycle but it came out perfectly.",5
"I'm a big fan of the ""idea of"" jumpsuits and rompers, but so often they go wrong. this one was an unexpected surprise. i'm 5'10"", size 8-10/medium, and the medium fit well and was actually super flattering. the waist is cinched just so that it's very slimming. the roll tab cuff is a cute touch and is probably 2"" higher on me than the model, but adorable none the less. great quality too. love!",5
"I have been looking for the perfect jumpsuit and this is it! i am 5'7.5"" and 122 lbs and the small is a perfect fit! the fabric is super comfy, you can wear a regular bra (yay!) and it can be dressed up or down! i am looking forward to taking this on my european vacation in august! the blue is a very pretty blue but i opted for the black!",5
I almost always return dresses after trying them at home but not this one! i love it and can't wait to get it back from the dry cleaner. the shoulders are really stylish and the dress is super comfortable. it has pockets which is also a bonus.  i told my husband that i want to bring it to a seamstress and have it duplicated in another fabric because i love it so much.,5
I was returning an in line order from same designer and saw this dress. i love it. much prettier in person. this will get well worn by me!,5
"This is the third jumpsuit i've ordered and written a review for this season. this jumpsuit is the best by far. i bought it in my usual size small (32d--31-38) and it fit me, even though i'm tall (5' 8.5""). i would say it looks much the same as it does on the model, maybe an inch shorter in the legs on me. love that the legs are rolled up by a tab and a snap--no uncomfortable elasticized legs. i am more legs than long torso (i usually wear a 33"" inseam with flats). the jumpsuit is very easy to g",5
"This runs tts - maybe a little on the large side. i typically wear between a small and a medium (or 6 and 8), and the small was a perfect fit. this is my second jumpsuit and i always worry about how easy they are to pull down for restroom breaks. (i drink a ton of water) this one is relatively easy - it has a button at the back neck that you have to unfasten and it's super easy and not awkward at all. i love how you can dress this up with heels for a night out or pair with sandals for a more cau",5
"I'm so disappointed this dress didn't work out! i ordered the size medium, post baby i'm a solid dress size 6 or 8 depending on the designer.
the cashier was laughing with me how ridiculously huge this garment was when i held it up. 

also the length was super long, description says 35"" which would be mid thigh for me, but this thing hit me mid knee. also, like the previous review the shoulders are tented and poofy. so bizarre and the cut reminds me of a maternity dress, but the shoulders def",1
These are such fun pants. it's a heavier denim without being so stiff. they run tts. i got my usual size 26 & they fit comfortably. i haven't washed them yet but once i do i typically wash in cold gentle cycle & hang dry.,5
"I've never worn a romper before but decided to give this one a try because i'm loving the colors/pattern. i'm so glad i did! it's even cuter on and very flattering! my only complaint is the buttons. i wish it was easier to remove and put on especially since this is a romper afterall. still, this is a beautiful piece!",5
Like the other reviewer said it&#39;s hard to get on and i had to size down like i often do at retailer. but it&#39;s so pretty and it&#39;s not too short like most rompers. we host thanksgiving every year and i&#39;m so excited to find an alternative to a dress/pants so i can work &amp; cook in style.,5
"Absolutely love this dress! i ended up wearing it backwards to work for a more modest neckline, but flipped it around for an evening night out. can't recommend it enough - two of my colleagues ordered it that day.",5
"I thought this dress looked cute online and was excited to try it on at my local retailer. it fits so well and is very flattering! i really like the material. 

the only thing for me is that i have long arms so the sleeves have to get pushed up, but it looks like that's how it's supposed to be.",5
"I love the look of this dress when it's on. the only issue i have with it is that the inside of the dress is white, which shows through on the chest slightly, but it's such a pretty dress and such an overall great fit, that i'm keeping it anyway!",5
"I did not intend on buying this dress, as i had taken two others that i had seen on-line into the dressing room. i actually saw the black version of this dress first, and was a bit disappointed that it wasn't available in my size. so, i thought i would try this on just for size. i was totally shocked as to how cute it looked on! i had taken both the xs and the s into the dressing room. the xs was very tight fitting in the arms and chest. i am very small busted, and normally wear a xs in tops and",5
Very comfy! can wear the dress both ways! the front is a deep swoop neck cut. the back is a v-neck cut. i flipped the dress around to the v-neck was more flattering on me due to having a smaller chest. got an size 4.,5
"The material is a medium weight jersey knit that is slightly thicker so it provides enough coverage and support to be flattering without being bulky. i think this dress is true-to-size, or maybe runs a little bit big, but only by a little bit. i bought a medium and am a size 8 in tops and 10 in pants. the dress hugs nicely on the upper body (arms, chest, ribs) and flares just a little bit on the hips/tummy/butt area. it is forgiving of little bumps or lumps. the scoop neckline is a bit lower tha",5
I am five four and one hundred and twenty pounds and the small fits me perfectly with enough room in the arms and chest. i am a 34c. the red is gorgeous and sweet. got it on line sale and worth it,5
"I bought this dress in both the red and black motifs and love them both. i'm 5'7"" and usually a medium, but i found the medium to run a little larger than expected. it's fine if you want the dress to hang looser on your body, otherwise, consider trying it a size down.",5
"Rarely do i find tops that fit similar to the model in the picture. my body type is no comparison. i am 5'5"" and about 170# with 30"" waist. this sweater in a large fit perfectly where the back lining and ruffle fell right at the top of my bottom which was very flattering. not to short and not long over bottom. just right. bought in cream and wish i would have bought in both colors...........",5
"I purchased this dress in the raspberry for my best friend's bridal shower and it was such a hit! i got it for the $60 sale price with the additional 40% off sale items that retailer loves so much- it came to $41! i paired it with a chunky gold necklace and it was adorable! so many compliments! i'm typically a medium through and through and this fit me true to size as well. 5'6"", between 135-140lbs. the cut of the dress fit me perfectly and the material is amazing. i'd definitely purchase this!",5
"I discovered seea bathing suits last year and fell in love. i currently own two - the hermosa surf suit and the . seea zuma. for reference: i am 5'7"", 135 pounds, 34c, 28 waist. dress size 4-6. pants 6-8. jeans 28. if you have questions about sizing, there is a great reference on seea's website on how to size. if you are taller than the reference sizing they provide, but still the same measurements as another size mentioned, they suggest sizing up as the suits are typically made for surfing/padd",5
"This is such a cute dress! the skirt is very full but does not add visual weight to those of us who already have enough actual weight. i ordered the black/beige print and the fabric is beautiful. it really drapes and hangs nicely. because there is so much fabric, i don't think this dress needs a lining. it seems to wash and hang dry well. i'm 5'4"", about 160 lbs. i like the way the medium fit. the length was slightly above the knee, which was ok with me (i'm nearly 60.) all in all, i can see mys",5
"I agree with the other reviews - it's a little small in the arms, low cut in the chest, but really broad in the shoulders. i bought the xsp, which is a size up from my normal xxsp. they didn't have xxsp to compare. and i am a small person with big athletic shoulders, and my usual problem is with things being tight in the shoulders and fit everywhere else. overall, an excellent buy at the sale price. size up for more room in the chest and arms.",5
"Great dress. the seaming helps add shape to the dress. it is flattering and super comfortable. this dress is so easy to wear, i'm sure i will reach for it again and again.",5
"I loved the details on the top of the shirt but was especially excited by the length of the top - it comes just over the hips and gives a flattering fit, as well as the sweet little micro sleeves. the color is kind of worn looking but it is so soft. i will definitely wear this a lot. 
 
i bought a medium but probably could've gotten away with a small.",5
"Love it! as a previous reviewer stated, you can actually wear it reversible.
so happy i purchased it!",5
"I find it very hard to find a dress. never like the way they look on me..this one???? fits like a glove, flatters my silhouette (which is difficult because even though i am at a good weight my waist is never small). looks like million bucks on me....i love it!!!",5
"I bought this dress online and have to say the material is really soft, has a great weight to it, and i bought it in the red motif. i just wore it to work this past week and received a ton of compliments on it. i wore it with black nylons black heels, and a cropped leather jacket. it is so figure flattering and so comfortable to wear. i typically range in size from an xs to a s, and the s fit me the best. i'm 5'9"" and 130 lb. it is truly a lovely dress!",5
"This very lightweight and semi-sheer dress fits like a midi dress on my height. the back hem ends low calf and the front hem is below knee. straps are adjustable and bodice edge is elasticized. the print is pretty and can pair with any sweater or jacket or jewelry or shoes that hits your fancy. my concern is regarding the 100% rayon fabric and how it will hold up after cleaning as all of my 100% rayon clothing from *random fast fashion retailer* does not last long. i'm 5'3"" 140# 39-28-35 and hap",5
"I have been looking for lace shorts for years. yes, years! finally found these shorts that are perfect. the lace is sturdy, not flimsy, so they are not see-through. i purchased both the cream and the blue when they went on sale. my skin is a bit tan, so lighter-colored clothing can be see-through for me. both colors are fantastic and i get compliments on them all the time, especially the blue shorts. plus, they complement either a t-shirt or a blouse. i love the eyelash fringe at the hem - such",5
Super easy date or work dress. it's a little small in the bust so i had to size up but otherwise a great fit.,5
I love this kimono. it fits great. and is gorgeous!!,5
"I love this sweater dress. i got the ivory color in a size small. i'm a size 6 & 5'5"". i feel in love with it while shopping with a friend, who kind of rolled her eyes at it. i went back later because i knew i loved it. since the ones on the sale rack were covered with dust and dirt at the hem. i ordered it on line in m & small and the small fit better. it is so soft, and the color is great.",5
"Even at 5'1"" this kimono works for me. because it's so light in weight the length and amount of fabric are not at all overwhelming. it can be dressy or casual, as others have noted.",5
"The colors and design are stunning in person. it is one-size and as most kimonos go it is billowy and flowing, and not fitted. i plan to wear it with a pair of black shorts and also with black leggings. i love the idea of layering this over shorts. i have a similar kimono and wear it as a bating suit cover-up. the long kimono over short looks fresh and modern and gives you the option to have some coverage when you want it. also, really pops over simple black leggings and black top. it's light an",5
"Let me start off my saying that i hate pants. i will wear dresses and skirts whenever possible to avoid them. however, i found these at my local retailer and just had to try them on because the pattern was so adorable. i have another pair of pilcro shorts that i love because they are so comfortable and have so much stretch to them that they don't make me crazy like other pants do. these were no exception! i love everything about them and am going to have a hard time not wanting to wear them every",5
"This is a wow! so chic...reminds of something i would have bought in paris. worth every penny. even my husband loves it on me...his words were ""it's a standout"". i work in the design industry so i am always looking for something that represents what i do...nailed it!",5
"Beautiful material- and washable!! i'm vertically challenged and the slits are a tad bit high, even for me- but still tasteful. i would suggest sizing down as i'm normally a medium in retailer but due to the nature of the material i opted to size down and i'm so glad i did!! no arm hole struggles with my particular dress either. overall just a really cute, versatile, cozy and functional option that will certainly get plenty of exposure for many winters to come.",5
"First off, let me say that i am 52 and don't often go for print jeans these days:) however, these are just so stinking fun and flattering that i couldn't say no. these look great cuffed for warmer temps, and rolled to full length will be fun to wear with fall sweaters. if you are looking for something fun and flattering, these are the ticket! i bought the grey version and feel that they will work with many pieces that i already have.",5
"I didn't have high hopes for these, because things seem to 'ride' on me- but these stay put! and i love the adjustable sides... these are a pretty color, i ordered the raspberry and the silver grey and love both! i normally would not pay a ton for undies, but these are worth every dollar! i have a larger bottom, so purchased the large, but sometimes i can wear medium, so this is great, being adjustable.",5
This is a lovely little nightie. i am a size 8 and i bought the medium and it fits perfect. it's soft and lightweight and not as see thru as i thought it would be. very light and airy and the sale price was great!!!,5
"I tried this on in the store. all of the dresses in the store were misshapen and pulled long in the armholes (and i love all of my local retailer stores!) i don't think these should be hung on a hanger. the knit is too heavy for hanging. the hem on the dress i tried in the store was dirty from dragging on the floor. i went home and ordered it online with the 20% dress discount and free shipping. the dress i received was clean, unstretched in the armholes and not oddly short like some review",5
"Based on the mixed reviews about fit, i waited to purchase until i could try it on in the store and was not disappointed. i'm wondering if there are different batches of this dress? i'm 5'7 and the dress fit as in the photo. the side slits come above my knees but not too high. arm holes are a bit large so if you want more coverage this may not be for you. the material is cozy and soft. the cream color is gorgeous. size wise, it definitely looks boxy and marshmallow-like if too loose. i am usuall",5
I ordered the chelan wrap coat in the beautiful red color. it's artsy and will be fun to wear with jeans and other casual clothing. it's super comfy and fits true to size.,5
"The cream color in this dress is divine. such a stunning dress that can be worn with a vest, jacket or alone. it looks very luxe and expensive in the cream color. because it's a knit, can go smaller in size. i tried on both the x-small and small. opted to go with the x-small. found it fit better.",5
"I did not notice this dress on the website. it was not until i saw it in store (was an online purchase & returned) - i was immediately in love. i love the color, texture and rosettes. i feel like a million bucks wearing it and have received so many compliments on it. before buying it, i actually ran home to gather a previous purchase and return it so i could buy this dress and not feel guilty! i am usually a 2 or 4 and the 6 fits perfect through and through. so happy with this lovely dress!",5
"Tried on my normal size in the store and i was swimming in it. the sales associate suggested i order the petite in store. perfect! i just wish there were more opportunities to try on petite sizes in store.
this coat is soft and roomy. when it's buttoned up it has a great shape too.",5
This trench coat is the best fit and feel-true to size and cozy! excellent material!,5
"I bought this kimono only a couple weeks ago...and i think i've worn it six times already! this kimono is stunning. light, airy and the colors are absolutely gorgeous. the print is unique and bold. i've worn this over a black dress...with leggings and a white tank...with denim and every color top. the options are endless with this beauty! the only downside is the kimono is so airy and oversized that the armholes easily get hooked on things. i ripped it once but thankfully it was right down the s",5
"I got this coat because i needed something black and thought the plaid was black. it's not -- but that's my fault and i love it anyway! it's perfect for our temperate seattle fall and winter -- not too light, not too heavy. i get a ton of compliments! i'm 5'9"" and about 145, and a medium fits perfectly.",5
"I own several of retailer's kimonos, & this has to be the prettiest. the colors are rich & more beautiful in person. i can't wait to pair this with jeans & shorts this summer!",5
I love this coat. i would definitely recommend it. i normally wear a size 6 or a medium. i bought my normal size and had to return it for a small. customer service was great and made for an easy online exchange.,5
"The lighter tinted denim is a faded blue-grey that will go perfectly with most of my wardrobe, and is more summery than the usual dark denim i wear. these feel like stretchy jeans to me, not leggings. i wear size 28 in most jeans and these fit tts. really nice.",5
"I love this sweater. i bought it in navy at this sale price and now plan on ordering it in the cream color. it runs a tad large and it might even stretch just a teensy bit (but not a lot), however i adore sweaters to be a little too big so this is perfect for me. whenever i wear this sweater i get huge compliments, to the end that the friends wants to go online and order it for herself. tkhe only problem with the sweater is that i love it so much, i want to wear it every single day (which is why",5
I love this top. i'm wearing it today. i bought it to wear under blazers and it works perfectly. i knew it would be slim fitting and while i normally buy med or sometimes small i bought the large and i'm glad i did. it's still form fitting without strangling me the color is very nice as well. nice fabric and well made. a great layering basic.,5
"I can't get enough off-the-shoulder tops. so even though this is out of season, i went for it...in both colors! my only con is the fabric has a slight sheen which cheapens the look a tad. like i'd read in other reviews, it does run a bit small for this cut top - i just wanted a bit more volume in the neck hole and in the waist since i won't be tucking in. if you want it more fitted and ruched around the waist, go for your normal size. i'll be ordering a small in both colors because i know i won'",5
"I just go these socks in one of my beauty boxes!!! there is nothing like a new pair of socks. they feel amazing no matter what you do. these are ultra soft and in-line with other slipper socks i have tried with the grippies on the bottom. i like the color black style (actually, i like all the new styles at retailer right now), and i didn't think i would like the higher tabs in the back but it turns out i love them to make sure the sock is covering my whole ankle when i put my shoes on. the",5
"I love this top. very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways. it is tight on the bottom. i usually wear an xs (5'4"" and 120 lbs). had to exchange for a small. very flattering. liked it so much i ordered it in both colors.",5
I just bought these jeans and i absolutely love them. they are my new favorites. i like them so much i am buying another pair. i am short but always wear heels and these are perfect in every way. slimming as well.,5
"Love these pants! super comfy and casual. i found they run true to size and are just lose enough to feel casual, not sloppy. my only complaint, the cuffs of the jeans were thoroughly covered in some kind of animal hair! very disgusting. but love the jeans.",5
Beautiful beautiful beautiful! goes great with pilcro stet big rise grey jeans and deep green hei jeans. i wear this on shoulders vs off. so lovely . beautiful rich earth tone colors and live the lace bottom. can dress up with black skirt or black skinnies and heels. highly recommend.,5
"This is my favorite pair so far from cartonnier. the side zip dresses up the pants which is something i was looking for and i just love the print. so happy with the quality, i ordered a second pair. fit true to size for me. i plan to wear them with knee high boots as it gets colder.",5
Beautiful top! you can wear it as a wide boat neck or as its pictured off the shoulder. the bottom is tight with ruching which makes it very flattering. i found the fit true to size. love the neutral light brown color. will look nice with white denim for the summer. excited to dress this unique top up or down.,5
"I bought these to have a pair between standard fair and sexy, but these are so comfortable and gorgeous i would wear them everyday! it doesn't even feel like i am wearing anything. love these!",5
"I just bought this nice dress on sale as i love the dolan brand and purchased my regular size small (34/27/35) and it fits me perfect so i'd say it runs tts. the material is nice and soft, not see through at all and a good length (i'm 5'4""). i bought the regular and didn't seem to need a petite. it's a slimming dress that's not overly tight too. i also really like the mock neck and don't find it constricting at all as the material has a bit of stretch. the short sleeves will be nice when it's sp",5
"I love the design of this sweater...shorter length, with shorter sleeves.
goes great with jeans and has a very different look!",5
"I am so amazed that i finally found the perfect, straight legged denim! not too skinny nor too tight b/c i have athletic calves. i have been waiting a long time! for reference i took a size 26 and usually wear a 2. it is great and comfortable for someone my age! i love these and they are the best investment.",5
"Pants are overpriced and very uncomfortable. to my utter dismay i wore them during a business trip for the first time and ended up with bruises caused by the side zipper. i have been a long time retailer shopper and usually my go to store, however,ending up with a pair of pants that caused me pain was a very big disappointment,",1
"So, i bought these pants in mid-september while at a local retailer store - i thought they were a bit short but the salesgirl assured me they were fine. wore them soon after and then discovered they came in tall sizes as well. anyway, one they came on sale i rebought them nabbing the last tall in my size. while that is a testament for how much i love them - the fit is true to size other than the length issue. i am 5'10"" with long legs - the 28t fit me perfectly. of course they cost me more than th",5
"I love this sweater, it is well-made, the colors are great, adn the feel is very soft. i just love troubadour, never knew of it before this season,but already own a few pirces.
i tried on the blue version, fits true to size, i don't hink i need the petite. the nexl ;ine was more falttering than the pcture shows. i love hte sleeves too. i think overall the shirt is a bit of flared out style, which i love.",5
This is my second pair of pilcro chinos. their pants and shorts are so soft--even those who love to run around pantless might relent. this brand tends to run a bit large so if you like your pants form fitting you may want to size down.,5
"These are great-looking chinos and very comfortable. i'm 5'11"" and--unrolled--they are long enough for me.",5
"This top is amazing! i originally ordered it in small, which fit, but opted for a large for the option of wearing it more off or the shoulder. the large fit perfect! great length for leggings and can wear both off the shoulder or just one... can't wait for fall! for reference, i'm 135 lbs, 34b.",5
"I rarely order pants on line...as the size often varies so much. took a chance on these as they were on sale and they are just stink'n adorable! i am so glad i did, i love them. i ordered both colors, haven't got the neutral pair yet but the green plaid fits me like they were made for me!! for reference i am about 5""3' tall, my weight is around 137.5 ish. i ordered the 28 regular, and they fit perfectly. i hope they don't stretch to much when i wear them. if so i will update my review.

"Bought this for my daughter in college for her birthday. i heard shouts of this being her new go-to top.
her roomies have already tried to borrow it. super comfy with a beautiful off-the-shoulder style.
no one can go wrong with this!",5
This is a great top going into the fall season. it runs a little large. i went down one size and it fits perfect!,5
"Well, another major score with pilcro!
these pants, in general, are my go-to pants--so i had high expectations when i bought them.

and, what do you know, they've met--even exceeded these expectations!

"I love the way this top fits! i am busty on top and smaller on bottom, and it really flatters. it's funny to see it called ""off the shoulder"" b/c so far i have worn it on the shoulders. when worn on the shoulders, the neck is very flattering, kind of like a cowl neck. i probably would not wear it off the shoulder b/c of the whole bra strap challenge. i got the charcoal color which looks great with jeans or black leggings.",5
"I'm 5'7"" 155lbs and ordered a large. it fit, but the arms were awkwardly short. the finish details on the end of each sleeve almost would have to be pushed back to the elbow for it to look right, which would be okay. however, the interior seam of the neckline is cut jaggedly and isn't even finished with any stitching. it's just tucked haphazardly inside the neckline and isn't sewn--it would unravel with washing. 

it's soft and snuggly and cute if you get it on super-sale and don't mind it com",1
Love this top! off the shoulder fits great! little extra room around the torso than i'd love... but still absolutely in love with this top! the black lace detail on the bottom is amazing! love the colors for fall! ordered a small and i'm 5'9 138lbs and i ordered a small,5
"I read all the reviews and they were very helpful the waist does run small so i sized up which was perfect. i love how this skirt is lightweight and swingy. i cant get enough comfortable denim skirts. so size up and you will love this, i am a slightly hippy girl and the skirt did not make me look big at all.",5
"I bought this in the green plaid for travel since i don't wear long pants of this fabric weight here in honolulu. it is styled so that you can roll the bottoms up for a more casual look, showing some ankle and wearing dress flats . would be a perfect casual work look with a navy tee. since i'm only 5'3"" and this is travel-wear, i got it in a regular rather than petite because i wanted to keep the cuffed-look but cover my ankles. i tend toward adventure travel and these held up well on a recent t",5
These jeans are excellent! i've been looking for a boyfriend jean that has plenty of room without just looking too big and these are it. there's lots of give in the material but they still conform to your shape. i highly recommend!,5
"Love this top. pretty colors and don't forget to notice the black lace at the bottom. can easily be dressed up or down with jeans or cigarette black pants and heels. everyone looks good with bare shoulders, so this is a definite for my fall / winter season.",5
This skirt is adorable and has a beautiful pattern! it's also extremely comfortable. a total steal at the sale price!,5
"This top is very gorgeous and chic. it is very tight at the bottom, but i feel like it will stretch a little over time, it is also very long which i love, because it can be rouched up to a great length if you are curvy. both colors are great, i bought both and love both. the sizing was correct, if you want it to fit like it does on the model shot. if you want it a little more fitted, size down, but it may be very tight on the bottom. all in all i love them and they are definitely a great find fo",5
"As soon as my eyes touched these pants i knew my body had to. not only doo they look great, they feel great. the material is very soft with just enough stretch. they've quickly become my favorites. i loved the first pair so much i immediately bought the other color.",5
"What a great fit! it is casual, but can be dressed up. i could have done the extra small, but the small isn't too big and is still flattering.",5
"This is a lovely sweater that doesn't look much on me the way it does on the model in the picture. i actually like it better on me! it's got a good scoop neck and it gives me a shape. i tried it on in a small and i'm on the fence about whether to buy it or not. i don't really need it, but with the discount codes retailer is offering these days i feel like i should buy it anyway...",5
"I purchased this sweater since the design immediately caught my eye. i love it. i am 5-03 fit and trim, but chose a large/regular to accommodate my shoulders and chest. the fit is close but i do not look ""poured"" into it. i do have a long back-waist length--not a true petite. the wool is soft, substantial; but not bulky. sleeve length is flattering. i plan to wear this sweater to the office on casual fridays with well-fitted dark-wash jeans--an appropriate look for anyone, not withstanding an ad",5
"Love the way these pants fit. love the length. love the cut! just the right amount of flare... normally i am a 28 or 29 in citizens jeans. i considered the 27 in them, but the legs were a bit tight. 28 was just about perfect. and the best part....they are finally on sale. i look forward to wearing them with flats or heels and a simple white shirt!",5
"This sweater looks heavy online bit is a very thin sweater. it runs tts however if you like the short length then i'd size down. i'm 5'4, 120# 34d and the xs was perfect. the sweater didn't feel too scratchy but it's not a soft sweater. very feminine.",5
"This sweater fits differently than it looks on the model in the photo. it is more fitted, less bell sleeve. and the neck is less boat-neck on me. i am often between sizes at retailer, but in this one i got the larger size and it fits well. i love this sweater. i just wanted to mention that i think it fits differently than what it looks like in the pic.",5
"This dress! the picture doesn't do the dress justice. its so beautiful, well made, and unique. lots of beading and detailing for the price. i'm super happy with my purchase !",5
The jeans are soft and comfortable.  they are the perfect staple in my closet.  more colors please!,5
This is a perfect late summer into fall top! you can easily pair with shorts and sandals then transition to jeans/booties for the fall. it's slightly on the roomy side (i am usually a medium and i had room) but i think that's just the structure of the shirt. off the shoulder style stays perfectly in place!,5
"I wasn't sure how this top would look on me but i just love it! i am 5'3"", 115 lbs and i ordered the petite small. i may even been able to get away with petite xs. i did not find this top too full, long or tentlike at all. i have a bust as well and it looks very flattering on me. i wore it with denim shorts and it will look great with skinny jeans. i would also wear it on the beach as a cover up. very versatile. i love the color and pattern on the top and really love the black lace on the bottom",5
"I love this style. reminds me of what we used to wear back in the 70's. it's very cute, flattering, and material is a high quality. will look good with skinny or boot cut jeans. if you like this ""baby doll"" style, you'll love this.",5
The material is great!! got them in both colors and went with a tall size for one. everyone compliments them!,5

"For the last few seasons,bordeaux releases this top in different materials and a slight variation, but same off-the-shoulder theme (the winter merino wool version was always sold out as soon as it hit the store). this is my third top in this version. it is very flattering but it must be styled right, which an retailer stylist taught me. it must be turned to the side a bit in order to fit correctly (but not necessarily have to be pulled off-the-shoulder). the bottom hem has to be placed at the uppe",5
"This may be the most beautiful top i've ever purchased from retailer!  gorgeous, classy, comfortable and one-of-a-kind!  i wish there were another pattern available so i could buy it.  runs large; buy a smaller size than you usually wear.  you will feel chic and confident in this flattering top.  i wear it on the shoulders; a perfect ""10""!",5
"I saw this on a girl at the winery where i work and i thought to myself - i have to have that top! it is perfect for the fall season. the pattern/print is very intricate and lovely. i think it fits true to size - the petite xxs is just right. the sleeves do not come to the wrist, but the photo here depicts that already. the elastic in the arms feel a little tight, but that would be my own negative comment. the fabric is beautiful and flows just right - it does not feel to big to me at all. i'm s",5
I got this in the blue and love it. tts and the shape is very unique and classy- better than shown on the model. it can be worn alone or with a long sleeve underneath as a layer. considering the neutral as well.,5
"Fell in love with the dress at the first sign. yes, have to confess that i always love white dresses- but this dress is not only beautiful on the picture, but also very pretty to put on. material is natural, gentle on my skin; style is simple, romantic, and it goes well with almost everything to dress up or dress down... very comfortable to wear, good for a long moon-light beach walk.
size runs large, have to get petite xxs, and it fits perfectly (normally i go with petite 2 for a fitted dress)",5
"I love this top, it is a cool style mix between mensware and women's. the collar is gorgeous, making it feminine and beautiful. i normally wear a size large in retailer, i would size down. returning my large for a medium. a beautiful shirt for many occasions.",5
"With all the white dresses to choose from this year, this was the one i settled on. it is comfortable, the quality is good, especially in the edge detail, it's machine washable (which is a must for me and white), and it is easy to dress up or down. i am 5'7"", 125lbs and found my usual size small to fit tts - it is loose fit like the model shot. easy throw on and go dress with cute details to boot :)",5
"I bought this dress to use for maternity photos and it is perfect! i love the flow of the skirt and the elastic waistband worked perfect. i was able to fit in a size 2 (normally a size 0) so i hope to be able to wear it after pregnancy as well. i was worried about the bust area being too small, and while it's a tight fit for me currently it still worked.",5
"So i typically avoid jumpsuits, rompers, etc. but there is always something that still makes me try them! and every time i'm disappointed. inevitably. which is such a bummer! so i knew this time wouldn't be any different, plus there was only an extra small available to try. which i'm definitely not an extra small, usually a medium maayyyyybe a small. but i kid you not, it fit perfectly!! it was super flattering in every way!! the material is so soft, and light weight, but still thick enough. i a",5
I'm not sure i understand the negative reviews either. the fit for me was perfect and i saw another lady try it on with a very different body type from mine and it looked great on her. the colors are gorgeous and i am in love with the fact that it has sleeves. maybe i am of an age where i don't always want my arms showing but it is so refreshing to have some choices in retailer of dresses with sleeves. i also appreciate that the slip underneath is a great stretchy material and not the stiff polyes,5
"I bought this top in the caramel brown and white. i'm blonde so the color combo is super cute. matched with a lower rise faded, worn jeans rolled and caramel leather slip on gym shoes and it makes such a cute weekend outfit. the top is very light and sheer so a camp underneath. it's a loose fit but not too much. do a little quarter tuck in the front and roll the sleeves and voila! super cuteness!
the fit was great for me as a slender but athletic build, small bust. true to size.",5
"Gorgeous blush color, soft flowing material made for a perfect outdoor summer wedding guest dress. the elastic around the waist could have been slightly tighter as the dress is a bit weighted but not loose enough to deter my purchase. i'm curvy and this dress was very flattering. i'm on the shorter side and didn't buy the petite (it wasn't available in store and i bought this the day before the wedding); i had to pick up the dress to walk up steps but was fine otherwise in 2 inch heels. i receiv",5
"I so wanted this top in red, and tried on the 0, but it was a little big/long on my 5'1.5"" frame #115 lbs, 30dd#, i tried ordering 0petite, but it was sold out. te only one available was the honey color, so i decided to try it, even though i am very pale... well, i actually do like it. it isn't as popping as the red, but it is super flattering, and the color is actually classy,... so i feel like i could wear this with a dressier outfit, not just casual. i love the feel, the fabric is airy, great",5
"I ordered this dress on a whim because i love the classic look, it has long sleeves, and the color is beautiful. i can't tell if there is sparkle in person, it looks like it on pictures, or holes... but regardless, love it. i tried on both xxs p and xs p and found the xs p was more comfortable for me, for those who find clothing at retailer is being made bigger, this is more a ""classic"" size, as in what i would have ordered in the past (this summer, i had to go down in size a lot). the fabric is c",5
"Soft and feminine, pretty pastel colors, very romantic. the fit is flattering and feminine, the fabric is light, the lining is soft. color is pale and i may need a little brighter colors, but i might let that pass... i am on the fence only based on color, otherwise, gorgeous dress. the 0 fit me well, but the back touched the ground, so i would probably order petite (front is higher, so no issue there).

"Nice light weight fabric, drapes well.  awesome detailing.  have worn twice already with lots of compliments.",5
"This is a great casual top. it is true to size and a light weight cotton blend. i am an xxsp which fits me perfectly and the tan and white looks crisp and clean. i keep finding myself choosing this top to wear with jeans, cut offs and white shorts. i am frequently chilly, even in the summer and like the long sleeve which i can roll up or keep down. i wish i bought the other two colors before they sold out in my size.",5
"I don't understand the negative reviews on this dress. i absolutely love the fit, may be the prior reviewer was trying a size on that was too large? yes, the fabric and the snaps are very delicate so you have to be careful putting it on and off, but the fit is very flattering on most people. i saw three different people trying it on in the fitting room today so i decided to try it on myself and had to have it! the colors are beautiful and the uneven hem makes it more fun and young. i will wear i",5
This dress is great! it's easy to dress up or down and is comfy!,5
"Loved this dress. it does run a little long even with 3"" high heels. i am5 '3"", and probably would have been
better with a petite size. often i do not like the proportions with petite so i ordered the regular size. i feel very feminine in this dress and love the opening at the side. i can walk in it if i hold the skirt up in front a tiny bit. not sure if i will hem it. the print is pretty; however, busy. i will keep this dress as it does make one look slim and romantic. i added an black belt, w",5
This top is so good i bought every. single. color. i sized up for more flow but it does run true to size. this is that sweet little summer top that we all long for!,5
"This dress is beautiful on! it is flowy and loose but is cut well so it avoids looking like a tent. white dresses with lace can run the risk of being a bit fussy-- the lace at the bottom is a beautiful detail without being too precious and the handkerchief bottom keeps it interesting. can be styled so many ways-- looks great with a cropped denim jacket, belted, or loose with a long necklace. also tried with a sleeveless long sweater vest and it was adorable. the dress is fully lined and feels su",5
"I was a little wary of this top but decided to try anyway. so glad i did. the style is great and the fabric is lightweight and comfy. i debated between the blue and the honey and ended up with the honey. it is just so different yet such a nice neutral. i am normally a size 10 (or maybe a large 8) in tops and purchased this in size 6. it definitely runs large. for reference i am 5'6"", 145 lbs, 34dd. not sure why another reviewer said this top isn't for large busts. it was very flattering on me an",5
"I loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it, but trying it on was a very different story! the photo seems to show a wider, more well-defined waist, with just a small amount of ""blousing"" on top, but this was not the case. yes, the waist fit, but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top, turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit. sadly, this is going right back!",1
"The fabric has a smooth feel, and the shape is perfect over skinny jeans. i like the yoked v neckline, a different take on the usual buttons of a popover. i wear a white cami under it from retailer to bring up the depth just a little. great with blue jeans, white jeans, and shorts. i bought this shirt in red, size 2. i'm 5'6"", 125 lbs.",5
"Super cute, great for a casual summer day. fabric is nice and light and honey color goes well with denim, kaki  or olive green. runs a little large but still looks good especially with fitted jeans or capri pants.",5
"I bought this dress last week for a wedding next summer. it did not appeal to me on the hanger, but once i tried it on, i was so impressed. the green color is lovely and it is lightweight and airy, and it does have a lining which is a plus. i love the little ruffle sleeves and the tie in the back is perfect. there have been comments about the hemline being awkward but the length on me was perfect and has just the right amount of flounce to be feminine. i can't wait to wear this dress! (i am 5'6""",5
"This is the perfect summer top! lightweight and breezy. looks great either tucked in to jeans or shorts or worn loose. loved the blue one, so i came back to get the red one. (i would recommend buying one size smaller than usual.)",5
"I saw this dress but was hesitant to purchase it online because of the reviews. i went to the absolutely fabulous new walnut creek store and though it wasn't on the floor they found one in my size in the storeroom.
i tried it on and was immediately enthralled. i am 5'10 and the dress flowed like a dream. i will be wearing it for my anniversary celebration with pearls and victorian earrings. i can't wait. it is lovely. you may need to be a little taller than average to wear this but it is wonder",5
"I originally bought the tan at the store. i loved it so much and ordered the red, but went down a size as it does run big. perfect for the summer.",5
"When i saw this top online i loved it, and in person i love it even more! so perfect for spring/summer and i can see it even transitioning into fall. the sizing is perfect - i am a size 12/l in tops, and the size 12 i ordered is just right. it's loose but not too loose or frumpy looking. the fabric is slightly thin but that's perfect for the summer, but it would be cute layered with a cami or a cardigan when it's cooler. the only thing is, if you a little busty, the neckline might dip a tiny bit",5
"I must disagree with some of the other reviews! when i first saw this dress online, i loved it and couldn't wait to try it on. i didn't order it online because i read some of the other reviews and so i wanted to try it on in the store before i bought it because i was nervous the fit wasn't going to be good. they were so wrong! maybe it just takes a certain body type. i have an hourglass figure, and i'm 5'8"" tall, i tried on a size 10, and it fit beautifully! the waist is very form fitting, and t",5
"The dress is absolutely beautiful. the fabric is light, the pattern is not overwhelming and has a zipper on the side to make it more fitted in the waist. the top is blousy, but i am only a c cup and it still was perfect. the bottom has an uneven cut that makes the dress very interesting. i love it. i am usually a size 2 or 4 and the size 4 was perfect.",5
"I bought this top in the brown /white combo although i really wanted the red /white but haven't had any luck finding it. i am never sure of my size in retailer but run anywhere from small to large depending on brands. i'm 5'4"", 140, 34 ddd. i wish other reviewers would state their sizes to help others purchase.. i got this shirt in size 8 which usually never happens to me. i wear a white tank or cream cami underneath since it is very sheer and dips low at the cleavage area. it is still flowy but n",5
"Once i tried this dress on i understood why the pricepoint was so high! it's very thick ( but not uncomfortable) and very well made. love the color and style of this dress, but as others have said, the model picture is deceiving. try it on in store to see if you like it for yourself! i'm curvy on top and bottom with broad shoulders and personally it was a no for me, i found other dresses that i loved more, this one was pretty but wasn't a hit for me.",5
"The fabric and color is stunning. very well made. i'm 5'8"" and this romper works fine. it is long enough in the body. true to size. love it!",5
Love the colors and top part but it runs extremely large and there is way too much fabric it is almost like a moo moo. had to return,5
This dress is amazing! i have to say when i picked it up to try it on i thought it would just be an ok dress but i thought might as well try it on. to my surprise it was more than perfect! the waste cinches in when it is zip it up and the blousing in the chest fits lovely.,5
"I had been eying this dress online for a while and when it finally came into stores i was so excited! this dress is so gorgeous and very flattering on my body. i love the bottom of it, it is more of a u cut in the front and square in the back. add an ada wrap belt and perfection!",5
"This is so pretty for summer. it is very lightweight and flattering on. the color was a little brighter than i expected, but it is still beautiful!",5
"Being 5 ft, long/maxi dresses are usually not what i buy, but i tried this dress on and it was the perfect length for me. i wear size 2 or 4 and i tried on both sizes in store. the 4 i tried on had a shorter length for some reason than the 2 (maybe it was a petite and was mislabeled?). i ended up getting the 4 and i love the dress!",5
"Gorgeous dress! love that it's flowy, soft, and fits very well. it does run a size smaller. i usually wear a 4 and went with a 2p one this one. the sleeves are a bit tighter on the petite than the regular in the same size.",5
"Living in a warm climate, i'm always on the hunt for great spring/summer dresses that can be worn to work, dinner, or just general out and about.
this dress is a great length with the varied hemline that gives you enough length for work or dinner. it's also great for a summer cocktail party or afternoon out shopping. i'm a traditional hourglass figure, larger on top and bottom with a small waist, dress size 6 or 8 depending on the top. i roared this in a medium and it's perfectly comfy and hang",5
I tried this dress on on a whim and will definitely be getting it! the fit was perfect as it is not to structured so its really a more relaxed piece even though it doesnt look it... but the way you feel when you wear it is just magical!! i love this dress!!!,5
"I absolutely loved this once i got it out of the package. it's a very vibrant print in the red print, almost a picnic vibe, and the material feels soft and high quality. it runs very large though, i usually take an 8 or maybe a 6, and am busty, and in this i am pretty sure i will need the 4. i almost convinced myself i had lost weight when i tried it on! but i will return the 8 and get the 4 in the red, as well as probably at least one of the other colors as i like it so much.",5
"Soft florals on light as air chiffon layers--what's not to like on this romantic dress?  i appreciate the elastic waist and the tie at the back of the neck, as it gives me flexibility during my weight fluctuations.  my only regret is that i'm too darn short for regular length and will have to wear platforms since the back of the hem drags on my 5'3"" self.  purchased the size 8 and i am 140# 36dd.",5
Charming dress! fit perfectly with great movement through back and chest area. flattering length(s) with just the right amount of fabric. inside dress sheath or slip dress. zips to waist for fit. i am smitten with the dress - just love it!,5
"This is the perfect dress! for it being a long maxi, it's surprisingly lightweight. the built in slip it covers everywhere you need it to without detracting from the overall look of the dress. i absolutely love it and wish it came in other colors/patterns.",5
"I would never have bought this top from the online photo but happily came across in in my local store. i bought it in the hot pink gingham check and it is so cute and fresh. will work well for hot summer days when i may want to wear rolled up sleeves as it is very lightweight and gauzy. i bought my usual xs/0, (5'7"", 32b, 115lbs), and whilst it is looser on me than the model, i would still say that it is tts - maybe a little fuller in the back than i would like, but i will wear mine partially tu",5
I love this dress so much. absolutely beautiful true to the size. since i start wearing it i got so many good compliment. the flowers is very spring and summary. very sexy to the bottom....,5
"This top is girl-next-door sweet. i'm mad about plaid so it was love at first sight for me! i love a blouse with a touch of spandex because i like the fitted look but not tight or loose, and spandex gives a bit of a yield. size 4 regular fits me well (i'm 5'2"", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips), the hem falls at mid hip and the sleeves fall about 1/4"" pass my wrist (i plan to wear this top tucked in and the sleeves rolled up since the weather is warmer now). the color honey is versatile, blue motif has a",5
"This is the best little romper i have ever tried on. i don't typically love myself in shorts but these are so flowing and the pattern is so pretty i couldn't resist. the material is nice and the length is great. i'm 5'6"" and 135lbs and the small fit great.",5
"This is a great long sleeve, casual shirt for spring - soft and airy. pairs well with jeans. i found that it fit me just right. i'm not very tall, but my shoulders are a little broad for my height, which typically puts me in the ""small/medium"" range, so i got size 6 regular. this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on. very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust. gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel. my only problem is there aren",5
"I... love... this dress. the fit is incredibly flattering (and i'm currently carrying more weight than my normal size). i selected a 6, which is about a size larger than normal, and it was a perfect fit. i tried on a larger size for measure, and the 6 provided a (perfect) fit and flare. i've worn the dress on three occasions, already, and each time friends remarked on their admiration for the dress, itself and flattering style for me, i have no issues, at all, with the cut, and to me, the bias a",5
"This is a precious! it's a little thin, as i prefer a thicker fabric. however, wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale!",5
I got this shirt in red plaid and love it. super cute without being too trendy. i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments.,5
"I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person.",1
"This dress is very flattering, comfortable and made me feel pretty!",5
I love this dress but it definitely runs big. i bought a size small and i'm between a 4 and a 6 and will have to return for an xs. the top feels like it will fall down and i'm a size 34c,5
So soft!! such beautiful fabric!! it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured. one of my favorite retailer purchases to date...,5
Love the look! it's a little tight but i still like it.,5
"Love it! i am 125# and usually a size 2-4 or 26-27 in bottoms. typically size up for holding horses. based on other reviews, i ordered this in a 2. it stretched just a bit after wearing all day, so i'm glad i didn't get my normal 4. the fit is great, quality is great. it dresses up for a casual office day, wearing well with boots and tights, and i imagine pairing with tshirt and flip flops over the summer. i unique piece that quickly became a favorite.",5
Can i tell you this top is amazing?! get it quick before it sells out!!,5
This skirt is so cute. this is a staple to have in your wardrobe. i wear it with boots and boot socks. but tights for cold winter days as well as flip flops in the summer. i got my true size of 4. its fits perfectly. i love the length with a peek of leg when you walk!,5
"Love, love this tunic. my size 4 fits perfectly with a little room, material is very soft and very comfortable. could be worn with leggings or with a belt as a dress...so many options. so worth it!!!",5
"This top is similar to other tiny tops that i have ordered in the past...beautiful embroidery, great neutral and metallic color pallet that goes with everything, and light weight. the top does run small, so i needed the large size to accommodate my 38in bust plus a thin cami (shirt is see through). the large fit similarly to the fit on the model.",5
"I must say that at first i had mixed feelings about this sweater. i was actually going to return it because i was unsure about the style and color. the color is to me like a lavender mauv-ish color but the description is actually ""natural"" . i must admit that in some light it looks more brown then lavender . regardless i think that in itself tells you that this sweater is not like any other. i actually wear it as a coat and its become an essential part of my wardrobe. i found the size to be true",5
"This shirt is stunning- definitely a shirt for special occasions. it's more than i would normally pay for a top, but it is a really special piece of clothing. the fit is slim- i'm 5'6"" and 118 pounds. i typically wear an xxs or xs in retailer clothes. the xxs is just right. it is quite sheer, so i imagine i will wear a nude tank top underneath.",5
This top looks fantastic on. definitly great when you want to look a little more dressed up! the fabric is a bit sheer so i will wear a nude camisole underneath. the design has the perfect amount of shimmer to make it dressy. it is so silky and feels great on! the neckline has the perfect plunge too.,5
"After reading the other reviews, i felt compelled to write one for this top. it is not often that i get to shop at an retailer store, but a few weeks ago, i had the pleasure. i saw this top, and while it was not on sale, i had to have it. yes, it is sheer and so you do need a camisole under it. the gold and silver embroidery is gorgeous. to be honest, this is my favorite top in my closet right now. i can dress it up or make it more casual. and, now that it's on sale, don't hesitate in this purchas",5
"The online pictures do not do this dress justice. the materials between the top and skirt are different with the black part being a soft, sweater feel and the bottom part being an appropriately thick knit feel. the contract is stunning and is largely washed out in the online pictures. this is not the kind of dress you see on a rack and think ""oh my gosh, that's the one!"" but if you try it on, you will have this moment. it is comfortable, flattering, and slimming-a prefect everyday dress.",5
"I feel like snagging a pair of these was the equivalent to standing in line for black friday, as they always seem to be out of stock. now i know why. these are soft, comfortable, and slimming. they're somewhere between the hold of control top pantyhose and spans--they don't fall and sag throughout the day and are nicely slimming without being pain-inducing.",5
Love this print and fabric! its soft and comfy with adjustable straps. so pretty and feminine!,5
"I tried on this dress in the store and was pleasantly surprised with the fit and the look. it looks way better in person than in the pictures. the picture really doesn't do it justice. i consider myself a ""slight"" hour glass figured girl and this dress at the top hit me just right so that the crosswrap looks like it was made for my body and the peephole/keyhole in the front (you can hardly see on the model photo) is visible. i'm so happy with this dress!!! i feel like i could wear it at work/chu",5
"Don't know why but i didn't have high expectations for this dress. turns out it's uber flattering! makes my waist look tiny, accentuated bust. perfect for those of us with straight figures looking for a little more curves. bottom half of dress has heavy silky linking. top half unlined and a bit thin. color is almost pearl -- very very light gray. i'm between xs/s (33b-26-36, 5'8"" 120lb) and went with a small. hits an inch above knees. sleeves slightly loose through upper arm which is always bett",5
"Love this dress, very flattering fit and the fabric does not feel heavy but is sturdy - i wore it for first dinner out with my husband after losing most of my baby weight and felt great and confident in it.",5
"Love this cardigan as a wardrobe staple to quickly throw on, especially over dresses (but also anything). it drapes beautifully, and i love the button closure detail. it is definitely a thin, soft, light-weight knit, but i think that makes it practical for year-round use, much like other items by bordeaux.",5
"As per usual bordeaux is perfect with this cardigan. very soft, washes well. love it.",5
This tee is amazing. it's light weight and perfect for the summer heat. the detail of the cross and tie back is perfect to elevate the style. this is going to be a solid staple in my tee collection. i wish it came in other colors because i would buy them all.,5
"I like the contrast of the skirt with the bodice, the length of the sleeves, adn the subtle cut out at the neck. the cut is very flattering, adn i am glad the daker color is at the top, hte bottome color would wash me out. i tried on the regular size nad i would not get a peitte in this as the size was the perfect length for me. petite would be too short for my liking. (regular hit just above the knee)",5
"I recently purchased this dress at my local retailer when it was 40 percent on sale. i was overwhelmed with how much i liked it. it's comfortable, elegant and very chic. 

i will make this my go-to dress from now on.",5
"I have been on a search for a dress with sleeves that cute enough for date night. as a bigger girl than most retailer reviewers, i was happy to find this covered my ample chest and between the crosswrap and a little flare in the skirt it camoflauges my belly. it is a sweater dress, which is not easily noticable in the web photos, and can certainly be dressed up for a dinner or for the office.",5
"These pants are soft, fun print and comfy. they are a drop crotch, but the cut is flattering without bunching up between legs. they are perfect for pjs all day type day!",5
This is my new favorite sweater. it is lightweight and drapey. very flattering. can be dressy or casual.,5
I wore this dress to work the other day and got so many compliments on the fit and the design - the wrap on the top. i got it in grey and it's a beautiful color for winter. the dress is very comfortable to wear.,5
I bought this dress for work and post work happy hours. love it! it's material is high quality and is flattering since it falls nicely on my postpartum figure. it's a little shorter than i thought but still appropriate for work.,5
"I worry when i have an elastic waist, or something that resembles this, but the dress hangs like a dream.
no puffing out, no gathers that you can see.
it is not sheath, but not a line either, kind of in between, hits several inches above my knees, but perfect with some black tights for winter. i saw the note about grey, have to try it on agin in daylight, but i would say think black on the top, light camel color on the bottom

"I love this little chemise! the adjustable straps sold me because i'm petite. i generally wear a small/27p. i'm about 5'1"", 124 lbs. i purchased a small and it fit perfect! the fabric is nice, not too thin or too thick. i would totally wear it just as easily as a nightgown or beach coverup. i've never been able to wear scrappy dresses, but it could probably pass for one of those too. it's flattering and pretty without being too ""pretty"", if you get my meaning.",5
"I saw the shirt on the retailer website and new i had to have it. when it arrived, it was perfectly draped, light and airy, and incredibly soft and comfortable.  it's perfect to throw on with yoga pants for errands or dress up a bit a casual night out with friends. would buy this again in several different colors if they were offered. 9/10.",5
"Great quality and extremely flattering. bonus that it is on sale. i felt like this dress was a godsend. i am five months pregnant and needed a dress that made me feel comfortable but not frumpy. i think i'll get a lot of mileage out of it, as there's enough stretch to get me through the next few months and then (hopefully!) i can wear it after too. also can be dressed up or down, so appropriate for many occasions. i believe it runs true to size (i sized up, from xs to s, for obvious reasons, but",5
"Yes, this is a great dress! i wasn't sure about it online because of the color combination. i think i would have preferred the gray color but it was sold out. it received very good reviews online so i thought it was worth the risk at the sale price. i am always on the hunt for great dresses at great prices (who isn't?!). once i received it and tried it on, oh wow! i love it. it is so flattering. it is a very pretty dress. i think i will wear this all the time. i am actually thinking of all the d",5
I was surprised at the positive reviews for this product. its terrible! it cuts you in a weird place to make you look wide. the skirt is also not like the picture. its darker and heavier. the material isnt great. i had to return.,1
"So i wasn't sure about ordering this skirt because i couldn't see it in person first but i'm so glad i did. the skirt and design is well made and doesn't look or feel cheap. the color isn't blaring, offensive red so it worked with my pale skin better than i anticipated. i wore it to my daughter's dance production with tall boots and a sweater and i got numerous compliments. fit is true, i am 5'2"" and i picked the petite length. the skirt has a slight a-line rather than a tight pencil fit but the",5
I was very happy to snag this dress at such a great price! it's very easy to slip on and has a very flattering cut and color combo.,5
