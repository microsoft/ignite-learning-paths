# OPRS40 - Train the trainer

## Session Abstract

Infrastructure and software delivery methods have a direct and material impact on service reliability. Manual service deployment is slow, error-prone, and can result in reliability incidents. Using modern and continuous deployment practices your organization can reduce deployment overhead while increasing service reliability.

In this session, we will see how Tailwind Traders uses modern methods for environment provisioning using infrastructure as code. We will then see how continuous delivery pipelines can be used to deploy tested software to production environments. As a result of attending this session, you will gain practical information on automated deployment solutions using Azure-based technology.
