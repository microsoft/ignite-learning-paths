# Building the Foundation for Modern Ops: Monitoring

You are concerned about the reliability of your systems, services, and products. Where should you start?

In this session, you’ll get an introduction to modern operations disciplines and a framework for reliability work. We jump into monitoring: the foundational practice you must tackle before you can make any headway with reliability. Using Tailwind Traders as an example, we’ll demonstrate how to monitor your environment, including the right (and wrong) things to monitor – and why. You’ll leave with the crucial tools and knowledge you need to discuss and improve reliability using objective data.
