## Session abstract

Infrastructure and software delivery methods have a direct and material impact on reliability. Manual service deployment and provisioning is slow, error-prone, and can result in incidents. Using modern continuous deployment practices and provisioning methods can reduce overhead while preventing incidents before they happen.

In this session, we will see how continuous delivery pipelines have helped Tailwind Traders and the rest of the industry deploy tested software to production environments to increase reliability. Weâ€™ll also explore modern methods for environment provisioning using infrastructure as code. As a result of attending this session, you will gain practical information on automated deployment and provisioning solutions using Azure-based technology.

## Delivery assets

The following asset are used for delivering this talk:

- [PowerPoint deck]()
- [Demonstration videos]()

## Demo instructions

One the environment has been deployed, select the container instances > containers > logs and scroll the bottom of the log output. Here you will find the specific command needed to connect to the new Kubernetes cluster. Copy and run this command in cloud shell.

```
az aks get-credentials --name tailwindtradersakscmmwyi53x4jls --resource-group twt-1000 --admin
```

Once connected to the cluster, run this command to list all Kubernetes deployments.

```
$ kubectl get deployments

NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE
my-tt-image-classifier 1/1 1 1 25h
my-tt-login 1/1 1 1 25h
my-tt-mobilebff 1/1 1 1 25h
my-tt-popular-product-tt-popularproducts 1/1 1 1 25h
my-tt-product-tt-products 1/1 1 1 25h
my-tt-profile 1/1 1 1 25h
my-tt-stock 1/1 1 1 25h
my-tt-webbff 1/1 1 1 25h
web-tt-web 1/1 1 1 25h
```

Identify the deployment with a name that contains login, and delete the deployment.

```
kubectl delete deployment my-tt-login
```

## Teardown instructions

When done the demo environment can be deleted using the following command:

```
az group delete --name <resource group name> --yes --no-wait
```
