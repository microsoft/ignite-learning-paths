# MOD20 Moving Your Database to Azure

## Abstract

Northwind kept the bulk of its data in an on-premises data center, which hosted servers running both SQL Server and MongoDB. After the acquisition, Tailwind Traders worked with the Northwind team to move their data center to Azure. 

In this session, you’ll see how to migrate an on-premises MongoDB database to Azure Cosmos DB and SQL Server database to an Azure SQL Server. From there, you’ll walk through performing the migration and ensuring minimal downtime while you switch over to the cloud-hosted providers.

## Demos deployment and preparation

In order to run the demos, you will need to run two deployments to Azure. [This is explained in details here](./01-preparation.md). You can run this deployment for training purpose and then delete the resource groups that you created, and deploy again. The deployment can also be run in parallel multiple times with a unique name. This is needed sometimes when multiple speakers are presenting the session in different locations at the same time.

## Running the demos

Before each session you will need to run a few steps to [prepare the demo environment](./05-prep-demos.md). After that you'll be all set, and you can find a [complete description of the demos here](./06-demos.md).
