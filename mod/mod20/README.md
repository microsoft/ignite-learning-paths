# Moving Your Database to Azure

## Abstract

Northwind kept the bulk of its data in an on-premises data center, which hosted servers running both SQL Server and MongoDB. After the acquisition, Tailwind Traders worked with the Northwind team to move their data center to Azure. 

In this session, you’ll see how to migrate an on-premises MongoDB database to Azure Cosmos DB and SQL Server database to an Azure SQL Server. From there, you’ll walk through performing the migration and ensuring minimal downtime while you switch over to the cloud-hosted providers.
